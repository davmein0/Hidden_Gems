Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. See Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Amounts shown in millions or billions within this Item 7 may not sum due to rounding.
Mattel has omitted discussion of 2022 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," of Mattel's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
The following discussion includes currency exchange rate impact, a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the SEC ("Regulation G"), to supplement the financial results as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). The currency exchange rate impact reflects the portion (expressed as a percentage) of changes in Mattel's reported results that are attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Mattel uses this non-GAAP financial measure to analyze its continuing operations and to monitor, assess, and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance. Management believes that the disclosure of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information to investors to allow them to better evaluate ongoing business performance and certain components of Mattel's results. This measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP financial measures.
The following discussion also includes the use of gross billings, a key performance indicator. Gross billings represent amounts invoiced to customers. It does not include the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts and other allowances. Mattel presents changes in gross billings as a metric for comparing its aggregate, categorical, brand, and geographic results to highlight significant trends in Mattel's business. Changes in gross billings are discussed because, while Mattel records the details of sales adjustments in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale, such sales adjustments are generally recorded by customer and not associated with categories, brands, or individual products.
Overview
Mattel is a leading global toy and family entertainment company and owner of one of the most iconic brand portfolios in the world. Mattel creates innovative products and experiences that inspire fans, entertain audiences, and develop children through play. Mattel is focused on the following strategy to grow its IP-driven toy business and expand its entertainment offering: 
•
Grow toy business profitably through scaling Mattel's portfolio, optimizing operations, evolving demand creation, and growing franchise brands; and 
•
Expand entertainment offering to capture the full value of Mattel's IP outside the toy aisle in highly accretive business verticals, by growing franchise brands and accelerating content, consumer products, and digital and live experiences.
Recent Developments
During 2024, Mattel continued to execute its multi-year strategy to grow its IP-driven toy business and expand its entertainment offering, growing profitability, expanding gross margin, and generating strong cash flow.
Mattel's full year net sales declined 1%, which reflects a comparison with the benefits of the 
Barbie
 movie in the prior year. Gross margin expanded to 50.8% in 2024 compared to 47.5% in 2023, with benefits from favorable supply chain and other efficiencies, the Optimizing for Profitable Growth program ("OPG program"), lower inventory management costs, cost deflation, and favorable foreign currency exchange and other factors, which more than offset the prior year benefit associated with the 
Barbie
 movie. Operating income grew to $694.3 million, an improvement of $132.6 million, and earnings per share in 2024 increased to $1.58, compared to $0.60 in 2023.
Mattel ended the year with a cash balance of $1.39 billion, compared to $1.26 billion in the prior year. Cash increased primarily due to Mattel's cash flows from operations, which were $800.6 million during the year. Cash flows from operations were partially offset by $400.0 million of cash used for share repurchases and capital expenditures, including $58.8 million for the acquisition of a property that will serve as Mattel's new global design center, which will replace a facility that is currently leased. 
During 2024, Mattel executed $400.0 million of share repurchases and has a remaining authorization of $600.0 million as of December 31, 2024.
29
Additionally, in February 2024, Mattel announced the OPG program, a multi-year cost savings program that follows the Optimizing for Growth program ("OFG program") and is designed to achieve further efficiency and cost savings opportunities, primarily within Mattel's global supply chain, including its manufacturing footprint. The OPG program has targeted annual gross cost savings of $200.0 million between 2024 and 2026. During 2024, Mattel generated approximately $83 million of cost savings under the OPG program. 
Mattel is operating in a macro-economic environment that may impact consumer demand. To the extent the macro-economic environment worsens, it may have a material effect on Mattel's results of operations and financial condition. Refer to Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" for further discussion regarding potential impacts on Mattel's business.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the Fisher-Price power brand was revised to exclude Baby Gear and Imaginext products. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
Gross billings were $6.03 billion in 2024, a decrease of $68.6 million, or 1%, as compared to $6.10 billion in 2023, with an unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates of one percentage point. The decrease in gross billings was due to lower billings of Dolls and Infant, Toddler, and Preschool products, partially offset by higher billings of Vehicles and Action Figures, Building Sets, Games, and Other products.
Dolls gross billings decreased 8%, due to lower billings of 
Barbie, 
which benefited from the 
Barbie 
movie in the prior year.
Infant, Toddler, and Preschool gross billings decreased 5%, primarily due to lower billings of Baby Gear and 
Power Wheels
 products of 5%, due to the continued strategic exit from certain product lines in 
Power Wheels
 and Baby Gear.
Vehicles gross billings increased 9%, due to higher billings of 
Hot Wheels 
products.
Action Figures, Building Sets, Games, and Other gross billings increased 2%, of which 6% was due to higher billings of Games products and 1% was due to higher billings of Action Figures products, partially offset by lower billings of Building Sets products of 2% and lower billings of Other products of 3%. 
Sales adjustments generally represent arrangements with Mattel's customers to provide sales incentives, support customer promotions, and provide allowances for returns and defective merchandise. Such programs are based primarily on customer purchases, customer performance of specified promotional activities, and other specified factors such as sales to consumers. Additionally, sales adjustments may include foreign currency transaction gains and losses from the remeasurement of accounts receivable denominated in currencies that are different from the relevant entity's functional currency. Sales adjustments decreased to $653.7 million in 2024, as compared to $660.6 million in 2023. Sales adjustments as a percentage of net sales were relatively consistent at 12.2% in 2024, as compared to 12.1% in 2023.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales decreased by $212.0 million, or 7%, to $2.65 billion in 2024 from $2.86 billion in 2023. Within cost of sales, product and other costs decreased by $203.4 million, or 9%, to $2.08 billion in 2024 from $2.28 billion in 2023. Royalty expense decreased by $5.7 million, or 2%, to $244.1 million in 2024 from $249.8 million in 2023. Freight and logistics expenses decreased by $2.9 million, or 1%, to $324.1 million in 2024 from $327.0 million in 2023.
31
Gross Margin
Gross margin increased to 50.8% in 2024 from 47.5% in 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to favorable supply chain and other efficiencies of 130 basis points, incremental realized savings from the OPG program of 90 basis points, lower inventory management costs of 60 basis points, including lower close-out sales and inventory obsolescence, cost deflation of 50 basis points, and favorable foreign currency exchange and other factors of 90 basis points, partially offset by unfavorable mix of 90 basis points primarily related to the prior year benefit from the 
Barbie
 movie. 
Advertising and Promotion Expenses
Advertising and promotion expenses primarily consist of: (i) media costs, which include the media, planning, and buying fees for television, print, and online advertisements, (ii) non-media costs, which include commercial and website production, merchandising, and promotional costs, (iii) retail advertising costs, which include consumer direct catalogs; and (iv) general advertising costs, which include trade show costs. Advertising and promotion expenses as a percentage of net sales were relatively flat at 9.4% in 2024, compared to 9.6% in 2023.
Other Selling and Administrative Expenses
Other selling and administrative expenses were $1.53 billion, or 28.5% of net sales, in 2024, an increase of $35.2 million, as compared to $1.50 billion, or 27.5% of net sales, in 2023. The increase in other selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to employee compensation increases and higher incentive compensation of $65.6 million, partially offset by realized savings from cost savings programs of $30.8 million.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $118.8 million in 2024, a decrease of $5.0 million as compared to $123.8 million in 2023.
Interest Income
Interest income increased by $26.2 million to $51.5 million in 2024 from $25.2 million in 2023, primarily due to higher average invested cash balances in 2024.
Provision for Income Taxes
Mattel's provision for income taxes was $105.6 million in 2024, as compared to a provision for income taxes of $269.5 million in 2023. The decrease in provision for income taxes was the result of the intra-group transfer of certain IP rights in the prior year, resulting in a net tax expense of $161.4 million related to the write-down of certain foreign deferred tax assets and establishment of certain U.S. deferred tax assets. Additionally, in 2024, Mattel recognized a net income tax benefit of $34.8 million related to tax elections filed to amortize certain intangible assets transferred as part of Mattel’s intra-group IP rights transfer and establishment of certain U.S. deferred tax assets, which was offset by higher income tax expense as a result of an increase in income before income taxes. 
Evaluating the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets often requires significant judgment and extensive analysis of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that these assets will be realizable. Mattel routinely assesses the positive and negative evidence for this realizability, including the evaluation of sustained profitability and three years of cumulative pretax income for each tax jurisdiction. Changes in the valuation allowances in 2023 primarily related to changes in the assessment of the future realizability of certain deferred tax assets, utilization and expiration of tax attributes, and currency fluctuations. As of December 31, 2023, Mattel's valuation allowances on its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and foreign deferred tax assets were approximately $14 million and $71 million, respectively. Changes in the valuation allowances in 2024 primarily related to changes in assessment of the future realizability of certain deferred tax assets, utilization and expiration of tax attributes. As of December 31, 2024, Mattel's valuation allowances on its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and foreign deferred tax assets were approximately $12 million and $85 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Mattel has recorded net deferred tax assets of $252.5 million and $243.1 million, respectively. 
32
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") reached an agreement among various countries to implement a minimum 15% tax rate on certain multinational enterprises, commonly referred to as Pillar Two. Many countries continue to announce changes in their tax laws and regulations based on the Pillar Two rules. Mattel is continuing to evaluate the impact of these proposed and enacted legislative changes as new guidance becomes available. Some of the legislative changes could impact Mattel's effective tax rate and tax liabilities. When and how these laws and regulations are adopted or enacted by various countries in which Mattel operates could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect Mattel's worldwide effective tax rate, income tax expense and cash flows. Mattel does not expect the provisions that went into effect in 2024 to have a materially adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Segment Results
North America Segment
Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, Mattel's American Girl business was integrated into its North America commercial organization and is reported within the North America operating segment. Prior to the first quarter of 2024, Mattel's American Girl business was a separate reportable operating segment. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the Fisher-Price power brand was revised to exclude Baby Gear and Imaginext products. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
Gross billings for the International segment were $2.64 billion in 2024, a decrease of $30.6 million, or 1%, as compared to $2.67 billion in 2023, with an unfavorable impact from changes in currency exchange rates of one percentage point. The decrease in the International segment gross billings was due to lower billings of Dolls, Infant, Toddler, and Preschool, and Action Figures, Building Sets, Games, and Other products, partially offset by higher billings of Vehicles products. 
Dolls gross billings decreased 10%, of which 8% was due to lower billings of 
Barbie 
primarily due to the benefit of the
 Barbie 
movie in the prior year. 
Infant, Toddler, and Preschool gross billings decreased 4%, of which 3% was due to lower billings of Baby Gear and 
Power Wheels
 products.
Vehicles gross billings increased 12%, of which 11% was due to higher billings of 
Hot Wheels 
products.
Action Figures, Building Sets, Games, and Other gross billings decreased 3%, of which 5% was due to lower billings of Action Figures products and 3% was due to lower billings of Other products, partially offset by higher billings of Games products of 6%.
Sales adjustments decreased to $427.2 million in 2024, as compared to $438.6 million in 2023. Sales adjustments as a percentage of net sales were relatively consistent at 19.3% in 2024 as compared to 19.7% in 2023. 
Cost of sales decreased by $95.2 million, or 8%, to $1.14 billion in 2024 from $1.23 billion in 2023, primarily due to a decrease of product and other costs of $92.4 million.
Gross margin in 2024 increased to 48.5% from 44.7% in 2023, primarily due to incremental realized savings from the OPG program of 100 basis points, cost deflation of 100 basis points, lower inventory management costs of 70 basis points, including lower close-out sales and inventory obsolescence, favorable supply chain and other efficiencies of 60 basis points, and favorable foreign currency exchange and other factors of 160 basis points, partially offset by unfavorable mix of 110 basis points, primarily related to the prior year benefit from the 
Barbie
 movie. 
International segment operating income was $389.0 million in 2024, as compared to $299.1 million in 2023, primarily due to higher gross profit of $75.9 million and lower advertising and promotion expenses of $10.8 million.

Cost Savings Programs
Optimizing for Profitable Growth
On February 7, 2024, Mattel announced the OPG program, a multi-year cost savings program that follows the Optimizing for Growth program (the "OFG program"), which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2023. The OPG program is designed to achieve further efficiency and cost savings opportunities, primarily within Mattel's global supply chain, including its manufacturing footprint. The OPG program includes cost savings actions in connection with discontinuing production at a plant in China, as previously announced in the third quarter of 2023, as well as savings from other previous actions taken in 2023 that were not recognized in the OFG program. Targeted annual gross cost savings from actions associated with the OPG program, which are expected to be completed by 2026, are $200 million. Of the $200 million in targeted annual gross costs savings, approximately 70% is expected to benefit cost of sales and 30% is expected to benefit other selling and administrative expenses. Total expected cash expenditures under the OPG program are expected to be between $130 and $165 million and total non-cash charges are expected to be up to $5 million.
The costs associated with the OPG program are expected to include the following:
Optimizing for Profitable Growth – Actions
Estimate of Cost
Employee severance
$90 to $105 million
Other restructuring costs
$10 to $20 million
Non-cash charges 
up to $5 million
Total estimated severance and other restructuring costs 
$100 to $130 million

(b)
Severance and other restructuring costs recorded within other selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations are included in corporate and other expense in "Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Segment Information."
As of December 31, 2024, Mattel had recorded cumulative severance and other restructuring charges related to the OPG program of approximately $74 million, which included approximately $2 million of non-cash charges. Mattel realized cumulative cost savings (before severance, restructuring costs, and cost inflation) of approximately $83 million, which represents approximately 60% benefit to cost of sales, and 40% benefit to other selling and administrative expenses, as of December 31, 2024, in connection with the OPG Program.
Other Cost Savings Actions
As of December 31, 2023, Mattel concluded the OFG program, a multi-year cost savings program that had integrated and expanded upon the previous Capital Light program. During 2023 and 2022, Mattel recorded severance and other restructuring charges of $32.3 million and $23.6 million, respectively, within other selling and administrative expenses and $(1.3) million and $10.7 million, respectively, within cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations in connection with the OFG program.
During 2023, Mattel executed actions to further streamline its organizational structure that were not included in the OFG program. In connection with these actions, Mattel recorded severance charges of $3.4 million within other selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.

Income Taxes
See Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Provision for Income Taxes."
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Mattel's primary sources of liquidity are its domestic and foreign cash and equivalents balances, short-term borrowing facilities, including its $1.40 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured revolving credit facilities (the "Credit Facility"), which on July 15, 2024 replaced the $1.40 billion prior credit facility, and access to capital markets to fund its operations and obligations. Such obligations may include capital expenditures, debt service, future royalty payments pursuant to licensing agreements, future inventory and service purchases, and required cash contributions and payments related to benefit plans. Of Mattel's $1.39 billion in cash and equivalents at December 31, 2024, $728.1 million was held by foreign subsidiaries, including $48.9 million held in Russia. Mattel's cash held in Russia can be used within the country; however, its movement out of Russia is currently limited. In early 2022, Mattel paused all shipments into Russia.
Cash flows from operating activities could be negatively impacted by decreased demand for Mattel's products, which could result from factors such as, but not limited to, adverse economic conditions and changes in public and consumer preferences, or by increased costs associated with manufacturing and distribution of products or shortages in raw materials or component parts. Additionally, Mattel's ability to issue long-term debt and obtain seasonal financing could be adversely affected by factors such as, but not limited to, global economic crises and tight credit environments, an inability to comply with its debt covenants and its Credit Facility covenants, or deterioration of Mattel's credit ratings. However, based on Mattel's current business plan and factors known to date, it is expected that existing cash and equivalents, cash flows from operations, availability under the Credit Facility, and access to capital markets, will be sufficient to meet working capital and operating expenditure requirements for the next twelve months and in the long-term.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017 (the "U.S. Tax Act"), provides Mattel with a reduced cost to access the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. With the passage of the U.S. Tax Act, repatriations of foreign earnings generally will not be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but may be subject to state income tax and/or foreign withholding tax, in addition to any local country distribution requirements. As such, Mattel has evaluated its intentions related to its indefinite reinvestment assertion and has recorded a $22.1 million deferred tax liability related to approximately $559 million of foreign earnings that will not be indefinitely reinvested. 
Current Market Conditions
Mattel is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates.
Mattel intends to utilize its existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and borrowings under the Credit Facility to meet its short-term liquidity needs. At December 31, 2024, Mattel had no outstanding borrowings under the  Credit Facility and approximately $9 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility.
Market conditions could affect certain terms of other debt instruments that Mattel enters into from time to time.
Mattel monitors the third-party depository institutions that hold Mattel's cash and equivalents. Mattel's emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal, and secondarily on maximizing the yield on those funds. Mattel diversifies its cash and equivalents among counterparties and securities to minimize risks.
Mattel is subject to credit risks relating to the ability of its counterparties in hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations. The risks related to creditworthiness and nonperformance have been considered in the fair value measurements of Mattel's foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Mattel closely monitors its counterparties and takes action, as necessary, to manage its counterparty credit risk.
Mattel expects that some of its customers and vendors may experience difficulty in obtaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials. Mattel monitors its customers' financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate accounts receivable collectability risks, and customer terms and credit limits are adjusted, if necessary. Additionally, Mattel uses a variety of financial arrangements to support the collectability of accounts receivable of customers deemed to be a credit risk, including requiring letters of credit, purchasing various forms of credit insurance with unrelated third parties, or requiring cash in advance of shipment. 
37
Mattel sponsors defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans for its employees. Actual returns below the expected rate of return, along with changes in interest rates that affect the measurement of the liability, would impact the amount and timing of Mattel's future contributions to these plans. Mattel expects to make cash contributions totaling approximately $21 million to its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans in 2025, substantially all of which will be for benefit payments for its under-funded plans.
Cash Flow Activities
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $800.6 million in 2024, as compared to $869.8 million in 2023. The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash used for working capital of $191.1 million, which included $285.8 million of unfavorable changes in inventories, reflecting the prior year impact of reduced inventory levels, and $86.1 million of unfavorable changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by $219.7 million of favorable changes in accounts receivable. The unfavorable changes to working capital were partially offset by an increase in net income, excluding the impact of non-cash items.
Cash flows used for investing activities were $189.0 million in 2024, as compared to $142.4 million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $42.3 million increase in capital expenditures, including the July 2024 purchase of a property that will serve as Mattel's new global design center for $58.8 million. 
Cash flows used for financing activities were $449.4 million in 2024, as compared to $226.6 million in 2023. The increase in cash flows used for financing activities was primarily due to $197.0 million of higher share repurchases in 2024 compared to 2023.
During 2024, Mattel repurchased 21.0 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $400.0 million. During 2023, Mattel repurchased 10.4 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $203.0 million. Mattel's share repurchase program was first announced on July 21, 2003.

On February 5, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1.00 billion share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2024, Mattel had a remaining authorization of $600.0 million under the program. Repurchases under the program will take place from time to time, depending on market conditions. Mattel's share repurchase program has no expiration date.
During 2024 and 2023, Mattel did not pay any dividends to holders of its common stock. The payment of dividends on common stock is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and is subject to customary limitations.
Seasonal Financing
See Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Seasonal Financing and Debt."
Credit Ratings
In 2024, Fitch changed Mattel's credit rating from BB+ to BBB- with a stable outlook, Standard & Poor's changed Mattel's credit rating from BBB- to BBB with a stable outlook, and Moody's maintained Mattel's credit rating of Baa3 with a stable outlook. 
Financial Position
Mattel's cash and equivalents increased $126.5 million to $1.39 billion at December 31, 2024, as compared to $1.26 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to cash flow provided by operating activities of $800.6 million, partially offset by share repurchases of $400.0 million and capital expenditures of $202.6 million.
Accounts receivable decreased $78.6 million to $1.00 billion at December 31, 2024, as compared to $1.08 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and the timing of sales and collections. 
Inventories decreased $69.9 million to $501.7 million at December 31, 2024, as compared to $571.6 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to continued inventory management efforts during 2024 and the impact of foreign currency translation.
Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased $26.6 million to $234.1 million at December 31, 2024, as compared to $207.5 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in derivative receivables of $16.5 million.
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $30.9 million to $1.28 billion at December 31, 2024, as compared to $1.31 billion at December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease of $43.2 million in accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in accrued advertising expense of $18.1 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Mattel is required to provide standby letters of credit to support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business and may choose to provide letters of credit in place of posting cash collateral. Although the letters of credit are off-balance sheet, the majority of the obligations to which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately $9 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
Commitments
In the normal course of business, Mattel enters into contractual arrangements to obtain and protect Mattel's right to create and market certain products, and for future purchases of goods and services, including for the purchase of future inventory to ensure availability of materials. These arrangements include commitments for royalty payments pursuant to licensing agreements, which routinely contain provisions for guarantees or minimum expenditures during the terms of the contracts. Mattel also enters into long-term debt arrangements that include periodic interest and principal payments. Mattel also has defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans, which require future cash contributions and benefit payments. Additionally, Mattel routinely enters into noncancelable lease agreements for premises and equipment used, which contain minimum rental payments.

Liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which a cash tax payment is not expected to be made in the next twelve months are classified as other noncurrent liabilities. Due to the uncertainty regarding the periods in which examinations will be completed and limited information related to current audits, Mattel is not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the periods in which cash settlements will occur with taxing authorities for the noncurrent liabilities.
Litigation
The content of Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Commitments and Contingencies—Litigation" is hereby incorporated by reference in this Item 7.
Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Mattel makes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. The accounting policies and estimates described below are those Mattel considers most critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements. These accounting policies and estimates include significant judgments made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made. As described below, however, these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used instead. 
Accounts Receivable—Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is based on collection history and management's assessment of the current economic trends, business environment, customers' financial condition, accounts receivable aging, and customer disputes that may impact the level of future credit losses. Management believes the accounting estimate related to the allowance for credit losses is a "critical accounting estimate" because significant judgment is required to evaluate the creditworthiness of its customers when estimating the collectability of its accounts receivable. In addition, the allowance requires a high degree of judgment since it involves estimation of the impact of both current and future economic factors in relation to its customers' ability to pay amounts owed to Mattel. Significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect key financial statement line items, including other selling and administrative expenses, and accounts receivable.
Mattel's products are sold throughout the world. Products within the North America segment are sold directly to retailers, including discount and freestanding toy stores, chain stores, department stores, other retail outlets and, to a limited extent, wholesalers, and directly to consumers through Mattel's e-commerce platforms. Products within the International segment are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most European, Latin American, and Asian countries, and in Australia and New Zealand, and through agents and distributors in those countries where Mattel has no direct presence.
In recent years, the mass-market retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors, causing some large retailers to experience liquidity problems. Mattel's sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral and are highly concentrated in the third and fourth quarters due to the seasonal nature of toy sales, which results in a substantial portion of trade receivables being collected during the latter half of the year and the first quarter of the following year. There is a risk that customers will not pay, or that payment may be delayed, because of bankruptcy, financial difficulty, or other factors beyond the control of Mattel. This could increase Mattel's exposure to losses from bad debts.
40
A small number of customers account for a large share of Mattel's net sales and accounts receivable. In 2024, Mattel's three largest customers, Walmart, Target, and Amazon, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 44% of net sales, and its ten largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 51% of net sales. As of December 31, 2024, Mattel's three largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of net accounts receivable, and its ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51% of net accounts receivable. Should one or more of Mattel's large customers experience bankruptcy or financial difficulty, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover such losses. 
Mattel has procedures to mitigate its risk of exposure to losses from bad debts. Credit limits and payment terms are established based on the underlying criteria that collectability must be reasonably assured at the levels set for each customer. Extensive evaluations are performed on an ongoing basis throughout the fiscal year of each customer's financial performance, cash generation, financing availability, and liquidity status. Customers are reviewed at least annually, with more frequent reviews being performed, if necessary, based on the customers' financial condition and the level of credit being extended. For customers who are experiencing financial difficulty, management performs additional financial analyses prior to shipping to those customers on credit. Customers' terms and credit limits are adjusted or revoked, if necessary, to reflect the results of the review. Mattel uses a variety of financial arrangements to ensure collectability of accounts receivable of customers, including requiring letters of credit, purchasing various forms of credit insurance with unrelated third parties, or requiring cash in advance of shipment.
The following table summarizes Mattel's allowance for credit losses:

Changes in the allowance for credit losses reflect management's assessment of the factors noted above, including changes in current economic trends, business environment, past due accounts, disputed balances with customers, and the financial condition of customers. The allowance for credit losses is also affected by the time at which uncollectable accounts receivable balances are actually written off.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, Mattel recorded a charge related to its allowance for credit losses of approximately $3 million, which was recognized as other selling and administrative expense. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Mattel recorded a benefit related to its allowance for credit losses of approximately $2 million, which was recognized as other selling and administrative income. In general, Mattel's allowance for credit loss estimates has historically been within its expectations and in line with the reserves established, and although possible, significant variation is not expected in the future. If significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates occur, they could materially affect key financial statement line items, including other selling and administrative expenses and accounts receivable. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease to the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of accounts receivable would have impacted 2024 and 2023 other selling and administrative expenses by approximately $10 million and $11 million, respectively.
Inventories—Obsolescence Reserve
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded for damaged, obsolete, excess, and slow-moving inventory. Inventory obsolescence expense is charged to cost of sales and establishes a lower cost basis for the inventory. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to the obsolescence reserve is a "critical accounting estimate" because significant judgment is required to evaluate the level of future demand for inventories held by Mattel as well as the prices at which customers are willing to pay for Mattel's inventories. As more fully described below, obsolescence reserves required for Mattel's inventory could be impacted by changes in public and consumer preferences, demand for product, or changes in the buying patterns of both retailers and consumers and inventory management of customers. Significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate could materially affect key financial statement line items, including cost of sales and inventories.
In the toy industry, orders are typically subject to cancellation or change at any time prior to shipment. Actual shipments of products ordered and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines, strength of competing products, marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both retailers and consumers, and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in excess inventory in a particular product line, which would require management to record a valuation adjustment on such inventory.
41
Mattel bases its production schedules for toy products on customer orders and forecasts, taking into account historical trends, results of market research, and current market information. Mattel ships products in accordance with delivery schedules specified by its customers, who usually request delivery within three months. In anticipation of retail sales in the traditional holiday season, Mattel significantly increases its production in advance of the peak selling period, resulting in a corresponding build-up of inventory levels in the first three quarters of the year. These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times create risk to Mattel's business associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of toys that do not match consumer demand. Retailers are also attempting to manage their inventories more tightly, requiring Mattel to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers. These factors increase inventory valuation risk because Mattel's inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to prebuild products before orders are placed.
When conditions in the domestic and global economies become uncertain, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts of the economy, including the economies in which Mattel participates. Because all components of Mattel's budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth or contraction in the markets it serves and demand for its products, economic uncertainty makes estimates of future demand for products more difficult. Such economic changes may affect the sales of Mattel's products and its corresponding inventory levels, which could potentially impact the valuation of its inventory.
At the end of each quarter, management within each business segment, North America and International, performs a detailed review of its inventory on an item-by-item basis. Management assesses the need for, and the amount of, an obsolescence reserve based on the following factors: 
•
Customer and/or consumer demand for the item;
•
Overall inventory positions of Mattel's customers;
•
Strength of competing products in the market;
•
Quantity on hand of the item;
•
Sales price of the item;
•
Mattel's cost for the item; and
•
Length of time the item has been in inventory.
The timeframe between when an estimate is made and the time of disposal depends on the above factors and may vary significantly. Generally, slow-moving inventory is liquidated during the next annual selling cycle.

For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Mattel recorded a charge related to its inventory obsolescence reserve of approximately $46 million and $64 million, respectively, which was recognized as cost of sales. In general, Mattel's inventory obsolescence estimates have historically been within expectations and in line with the reserves established, and although possible, significant variation is not expected in the future. If significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimate occur, they could materially affect key financial statement line items, including cost of sales and inventories. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease to inventory reserves as a percentage of gross inventory at December 31, 2024 and 2023 would have impacted 2024 and 2023 cost of sales by approximately $5 million and $6 million, respectively.
Goodwill 
Mattel tests goodwill for impairment annually or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment may have occurred. Management believes that the accounting estimates related to the fair value estimates of its goodwill are "critical accounting estimates" because assessing goodwill for impairment involves a high degree of judgment due to the prospective assumptions that underlie the fair value assessments, such as projecting future cash flows for Mattel's reporting units and estimating the weighted-average cost of capital that a market participant would use as a discount rate. Significant changes in the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment tests could materially affect key financial statement line items, including other selling and administrative expenses and goodwill. 
42
Goodwill is allocated to reporting units for purposes of evaluating whether goodwill is impaired. Mattel's reporting units are: (i) North America, (ii) International, and (iii) American Girl. Mattel then assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. This qualitative assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. 
When the quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary, impairment is determined by estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing that value to the reporting unit's carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the excess, limited by the amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.
When performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, Mattel determines the fair value of its reporting units based upon one or more acceptable valuation approaches. Mattel utilizes the income approach for each of its reporting units and also utilizes the market approach for the North America and International reporting units. The income approach determines the fair value based upon the discounted cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future. The market approach determines fair value utilizing earnings multiples of comparable public companies, which are reflective of the market in which each respective reporting unit operates, and recent comparable market transactions. The income approach requires Mattel to make projections of revenue, gross margin, operating costs, and working capital investment for the reporting unit over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must make an estimate of a weighted-average cost of capital that a market participant would use as a discount rate. Changes in these projections or estimates would impact the estimated fair value, which could significantly change the amount of any impairment ultimately recorded.  
Mattel performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment as of August 1, 2024, and the resulting calculations indicated that the fair values exceeded the carrying amounts of Mattel's reporting units by 4.2 times, 2.2 times, and 1.8 times for the North America, International, and American Girl reporting units, respectively. There were no events or changes in circumstances subsequent to the third quarter assessment that indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value as of December 31, 2024. 
Sales Adjustments
Mattel routinely enters into arrangements with its customers to provide sales incentives, support customer promotions, and provide allowances for returns and defective merchandise. Such programs are based primarily on customer purchases, customer performance of specified promotional activities, and other specified factors such as sales to consumers.

Management believes that the accounting estimates related to sales adjustments are "critical accounting estimates" because significant judgment is required to estimate related accruals, such as estimating future customer sales volume to support volume-based sales incentives, estimating volumes of defective products to support reserves for defective merchandise, and estimating future customer performance and consumer preferences that could impact the discretionary sales promotions. Significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates could materially affect key financial statement line items, including net sales and accounts receivable.
The above-described programs primarily involve fixed amounts or percentages of sales to customers.

The accruals for such programs, which can either be contractual or discretionary in nature, are based on an assessment of customer purchases, customer performance of specified promotional activities, and other specified factors such as customer sales volume.

While certain sales adjustment amounts are readily determinable at year-end and do not require estimates, other sales adjustments, such as discretionary sales adjustments, require significant judgment by management to make these estimates. In making these estimates, management considers all available information, including the overall business environment, historical trends, and information from customers.

Accruals for these programs are recorded as sales adjustments that reduce gross billings in the period the related sale is recognized. Sales adjustments for such programs totaled $653.7 million or 12.2% as a percentage of net sales in 2024 and $660.6 million or 12.1% as a percentage of net sales in 2023. If significant changes in the assumptions used to develop the estimates occur, they could impact Mattel's results of operations or financial condition. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in Mattel's sales adjustments as a percentage of net sales during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 would have impacted 2024 and 2023 net sales and accounts receivable by approximately $54 million. 
43
Income Taxes 
Mattel's income tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities are based on actual and expected future income, U.S. federal and foreign statutory income tax rates, and tax regulations and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which Mattel operates. Management believes that the accounting estimates related to income taxes are "critical accounting estimates" because significant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, evaluating Mattel's worldwide uncertain tax positions, and assessing the likelihood of realizing certain tax benefits. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes in judgments could materially affect Mattel's consolidated financial statements. 
Certain income and expense items are accounted for differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes. As a result, the income tax expense reflected in Mattel's consolidated statements of operations is different than that reported in Mattel's tax returns filed with the taxing authorities. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in Mattel's tax return, and some are temporary differences that reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These timing differences create deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in Mattel's tax returns in future years for which Mattel has already recorded a tax benefit in its consolidated statements of operations. Mattel records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. Management evaluates the level of Mattel's valuation allowances at least annually, and more frequently if actual operating results differ significantly from forecasted results. 
Changes in the valuation allowances in 2023 primarily related to changes in assessment of the future realizability of certain deferred tax assets, utilization and expiration of tax attributes, and currency fluctuations. As of December 31, 2023, Mattel's valuation allowances on its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and foreign deferred tax assets were approximately $14 million and $71 million, respectively. Changes in the valuation allowances in 2024 primarily related to changes in assessment of the future realizability of certain deferred tax assets, utilization and expiration of tax attributes. As of December 31, 2024, Mattel's valuation allowances on its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and foreign deferred tax assets were approximately $12 million and $85 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Mattel has recorded net deferred tax assets of $252.5 million and $243.1 million, respectively. 
Mattel records unrecognized tax benefits for U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax positions related primarily to transfer pricing, tax credits claimed, tax nexus, and apportionment. For each reporting period, management applies a consistent methodology to measure unrecognized tax benefits and all unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed periodically and adjusted as circumstances warrant. Mattel's measurement of its unrecognized tax benefits is based on management's assessment of all relevant information, including prior audit experience, the status of audits, conclusions of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, identification of new issues, and any administrative guidance or developments. Mattel recognizes unrecognized tax benefits in the first financial reporting period in which information becomes available indicating that such benefits will more likely than not (a greater than 50 percent likelihood) be realized. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the unrecognized tax benefit balance, inclusive of interest and penalties, and net of U.S. federal tax benefit was $151.7 million and $144.9 million, respectively.
In the normal course of business, Mattel is regularly audited by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Many of the judgments made in adjusting uncertain tax positions involve assumptions and estimates regarding audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements, which are often uncertain and subject to change. The ultimate settlement of any particular issue with the applicable taxing authority could have a material impact on Mattel's consolidated financial statements.

See Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
To supplement the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Mattel presents a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the SEC. The non-GAAP financial measure that Mattel presents is currency exchange rate impact. Mattel uses this measure to analyze its continuing operations and to monitor, assess, and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance. Mattel believes that the disclosure of this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information to investors to be able to better evaluate ongoing business performance and certain components of Mattel's results. This measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.
44
Currency Exchange Rate Impact
The currency exchange rate impact reflects the portion (expressed as a percentage) of changes in Mattel's reported results that are attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
For entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, Mattel calculates the percentage change of period-over-period results at constant currency exchange rates (established as described below) by translating current period and prior period results using these rates and then determines the currency exchange rate impact percentage by calculating the difference between the percentage change at such constant currency exchange rates and the percentage change at actual exchange rates.
The constant currency exchange rates are determined by Mattel at the beginning of each year and are applied consistently during the year. They are generally different from the actual exchange rates in effect during the current or prior period due to volatility in actual currency exchange rates. Mattel considers whether any changes to the constant currency rates are appropriate at the beginning of each year. The exchange rates used for these constant currency calculations are generally based on prior year actual exchange rates.
Mattel believes that the disclosure of the percentage impact of currency changes is useful supplemental information for investors to be able to gauge Mattel's current business performance and the longer-term strength of its overall business since currency changes could potentially mask underlying sales trends. The disclosure of the percentage impact of currency exchange allows investors to calculate the impact on a constant currency basis and also enhances their ability to compare financial results from one period to another.
Key Performance Indicator
Gross billings represent amounts invoiced to customers. It does not include the impact of sales adjustments, such as trade discounts and other allowances. Mattel presents changes in gross billings as a metric for comparing its aggregate, categorical, brand, and geographic results to highlight significant trends in Mattel's business. Changes in gross billings are discussed because, while Mattel records the details of sales adjustments in its financial accounting systems at the time of sale, such sales adjustments are generally recorded by customer and not associated with categories, brands, or individual products.
Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
Currency exchange rate fluctuations impact Mattel's results of operations and cash flows. The Euro and Chinese yuan were the primary currencies that caused foreign currency transaction exposure for Mattel in 2024. Mattel seeks to mitigate its foreign currency exchange risk by monitoring its foreign currency transaction exposure for the year and partially hedging such exposure using foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily to hedge its purchase and sale of inventory and other intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts generally have maturity dates of up to 24 months. For those intercompany receivables and payables that are not hedged, the transaction gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the exchange rate changes as part of operating income

or other non-operating expense (income), net

based on the nature of the underlying transaction. Transaction gains or losses on hedged intercompany inventory transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the inventory is sold to customers. In addition, Mattel manages its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations through the selection of currencies used for international borrowings. Mattel does not trade in financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Mattel's financial position is also impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations on translation of its net investments in subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. Income, expense, and cash flow items are translated at weighted-average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The resulting currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders' equity. Mattel's primary currency translation adjustments in 2024 were related to its net investments in entities having functional currencies denominated in the Mexican peso, Russian ruble, and Brazilian real. 
There are numerous factors impacting the amount by which Mattel's financial results are affected by foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, including, but not limited to, the level of foreign currency forward exchange contracts in place at a given time and the volume of foreign currency-denominated transactions in a given period. However, assuming that such factors were held constant, Mattel estimates that a one percent change in the U.S. dollar would have impacted Mattel's 2024 net sales by approximately 0.4% and would have less than a $0.01 impact to Mattel's net income per share.

    The weighted-average contract rate for these contracts is quoted in U.S. dollar per local currency. 
For the purchase of foreign currencies, fair value reflects the amount, based on dealer quotes, that Mattel would pay at maturity for contracts involving the same notional amounts, currencies, and maturity dates, if they had been entered into as of December 31, 2024. For the sale of foreign currencies, fair value reflects the amount, based on dealer quotes, that Mattel would receive at maturity for contracts involving the same notional amounts, currencies, and maturity dates, if they had been entered into as of December 31, 2024. The differences between the market forward amounts and the contract amounts are expected to be fully offset by currency transaction gains and losses on the underlying hedged transactions.
In addition to the contracts involving the U.S. dollar detailed in the above table, Mattel also had contracts to sell British pound sterling for the purchase of Euro. As of December 31, 2024, these contracts had a contract amount of $69.0 million and a fair value liability of $1.4 million.
Had Mattel not entered into hedges to limit the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on its results of operations and cash flows, its earnings before income taxes would have decreased by approximately $30 million in each of 2024 and 2023.
Turkey Operations

Effective April 1, 2022, Mattel has accounted for Turkey as a highly inflationary economy, as the projected three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%. As such, beginning April 1, 2022, Mattel's Turkey subsidiary has designated the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Mattel's Turkey subsidiary represented approximately 1% of Mattel's consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Mattel's management, including Ynon Kreiz, its principal executive officer, and Anthony DiSilvestro, its principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Mattel's internal control over financial reporting using the framework in
 Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Mattel's internal control over financial reporting is not effective as of December 31, 2024, due to a material weakness in Mattel's internal control over financial reporting, as further described below. The effectiveness of Mattel's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that appears herein.
Material Weakness
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
Mattel identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to certain of its information technology general controls within certain of the Company's information technology systems. Specifically, Mattel did not design and maintain effective user access and provisioning review controls to prevent or detect inappropriate user and privileged access to, or ensure the appropriate segregation of duties within, those systems. 
The control deficiencies described above did not result in a material misstatement to Mattel’s consolidated financial statements; however, those deficiencies raise a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Therefore, management concluded that the deficiencies represent a material weakness.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Mattel, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mattel, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts and allowances for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 appearing after Item 16 and the signature and power of attorney pages (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO because a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to certain of its information technology general controls within certain of the Company's information technology systems, as the Company did not design and maintain effective user access and provisioning review controls to prevent or detect inappropriate user and privileged access to, or ensure the appropriate segregation of duties within, those systems. 
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness referred to above is described in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. We considered this material weakness in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management's report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
48
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Sales Adjustments Accrual – Discretionary Component
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company routinely enters into arrangements with its customers to provide sales incentives, support customer promotions, and allowances for returns or defective merchandise. Accruals for these programs are recorded in net sales as sales adjustments that reduce gross billings in the period the related sale is recognized. The accrual for such programs, which can either be contractual or discretionary in nature, is based on an assessment of customer purchases, customer performance of specified promotional activities, and other specified factors such as customer sales volume. As disclosed by management, sales adjustments for such programs totaled $653.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a portion of which is discretionary in nature. While certain sales adjustment amounts are readily determinable at year end and do not require estimates, other sales adjustments, such as discretionary sales adjustments, require significant judgment by management to make these estimates. In making these estimates, management considers all available information, including the overall business environment, historical trends, and information from customers. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the discretionary component of the sales adjustments accrual is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the discretionary component of the sales adjustments accrual and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and  effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management's estimate. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the estimate of the discretionary component of the sales adjustments accrual. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for developing the estimate of the discretionary component of the sales adjustments accrual, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of available information considered by management in developing the estimate, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the estimate, (iv) evaluating, on a sample basis, the results of a retrospective comparison of sales adjustments accrued in the prior year to settlements in the current year, and (v) testing, on a sample basis, settlements subsequent to year-end.

MATTEL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1—
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel") and its subsidiaries. All wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries are consolidated and included in Mattel's consolidated financial statements. Mattel does not have any minority stock ownership interests in which it has a controlling financial interest that would require consolidation. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Use of Estimates
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates.
Cash and Equivalents
Cash and equivalents include short-term investments, which are highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Such investments are stated at cost, which approximates market value.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses
Credit is granted to customers on an unsecured basis. Credit limits and payment terms are established based on extensive evaluations made on an ongoing basis throughout the fiscal year of the financial performance, cash generation, financing availability, and liquidity status of each customer. Customers are reviewed at least annually, with more frequent reviews performed as necessary, based on the customers' financial condition and the level of credit being extended. For customers who are experiencing financial difficulties, management performs additional financial analyses before shipping to those customers on credit. Mattel uses a variety of financial arrangements to ensure collectability of accounts receivable of customers, including requiring letters of credit, purchasing various forms of credit insurance with unrelated third parties, or requiring cash in advance of shipment.
Mattel records an allowance for credit losses based on collection history and management's assessment of the current economic trends, business environment, customers' financial condition, accounts receivable aging, and customer disputes that may impact the level of future credit losses.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Expense associated with inventory obsolescence is recognized in cost of sales and establishes a lower cost basis for the inventory. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 
10
 to 
30
 years for buildings and building improvements, 
3
 to 
15
 years for machinery and equipment, 
3
 to 
10
 years for software, and 
10
 to 
20
 years, not to exceed the lease term, for leasehold improvements. Tools, dies, and molds are depreciated using the straight-line method over 
3
 years. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, where appropriate, changes are made prospectively. The carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment is reviewed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Any potential impairment identified is initially assessed by evaluating the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying asset groups. When property, plant and equipment are sold or retired, the cost of the property and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheets, and any resulting gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations.
55
Leases
Mattel routinely enters into noncancelable lease agreements primarily for premises and equipment used in the normal course of business. Mattel excludes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less from the balance sheet, and combines lease and non-lease components for property leases, which primarily relate to ancillary expenses such as common area maintenance charges and management fees.
Mattel determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception by assessing whether it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Mattel's leases may include 
one
 or more options to renew for additional terms of up to 
10
 years. Renewal and termination options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that Mattel will exercise the option. Certain of these leases include escalation clauses that adjust rental expense to reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal and termination options. A portion of Mattel's lease agreements include contingent rental payments based on a percentage of sales. 
Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As substantially all of Mattel's leases do not provide an implicit rate, Mattel uses its incremental borrowing rate, based on the information available at the lease commencement date, to determine the present value of lease payments. Operating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill is allocated to reporting units for the purpose of evaluating whether goodwill is impaired. Mattel's reporting units are: (i) North America, which consists of the United States and Canada, (ii) International, and (iii) American Girl. In the first quarter of 2024, Mattel announced an organizational change that resulted in the American Girl business being integrated into Mattel's North America commercial organization. Such integration resulted in a change to Mattel's operating and reportable segments. Goodwill related to the American Girl reporting unit is included in the North America operating segment. Mattel's reportable segments are: (i) North America; and (ii) International. Components of the operating segments have been aggregated into a single reporting unit as the components have similar economic characteristics.

The similar economic characteristics include the nature of the products, the nature of the production processes, the customers, and the manner in which the products are distributed. Mattel tests its goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value.
Mattel also tests its amortizable intangible assets, which are primarily comprised of trademarks and trade names, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable. Amortization is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the amortizable intangible assets.
Content Assets
Mattel incurs and capitalizes direct costs associated with the production of episodic series, feature films, and other similar forms of content. Content assets are recorded within other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Mattel's content assets are predominately monetized individually and amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues ("Ultimate Revenues"). Ultimate Revenues include revenues forecasted to be earned within ten years from the date of initial release of the content asset. Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period. If Mattel's estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment. To the extent Mattel's estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed. Content asset amortization is recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Unamortized content assets shall be tested for impairment at the individual content asset level when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset may be less than its unamortized costs.

Foreign Currency Translation Exposure
Mattel's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The translation of its net investments in subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies subjects Mattel to the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations in its results of operations and financial position. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. Net income and cash flow items are translated at weighted-average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The resulting currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity.

56
Foreign Currency Transaction Exposure
Currency exchange rate fluctuations may impact Mattel's results of operations and cash flows. Mattel's currency transaction exposures include gains and losses realized on unhedged inventory purchases and unhedged receivables and payables balances that are denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional currency. Gains and losses on unhedged inventory purchases and other transactions associated with operating activities are recorded in the components of operating income in the consolidated statements of operations. Transaction gains or losses on hedged intercompany inventory transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the inventory is sold to customers. Gains and losses on unhedged intercompany loans and advances are recorded as a component of other non-operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the currency exchange rate changes.

Derivative Instruments
Mattel uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges primarily to hedge its purchases and sales of inventory denominated in foreign currencies. At the inception of the contracts, Mattel designates these derivatives as cash flow hedges and documents the relationship of the hedge to the underlying transaction. Hedge effectiveness is assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedge to ensure the hedge qualifies for hedge accounting. Changes in fair value associated with hedge ineffectiveness, if any, are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in fair value of cash flow hedge derivatives are deferred and recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity until the underlying transaction affects earnings. In the event that an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur, Mattel recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative in its consolidated statements of operations in the period the determination is made.
Mattel uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge intercompany loans and advances denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the short-term nature of the contracts involved, Mattel does not use hedge accounting for these contracts, and as such, changes in fair value are recorded in the period of change in the consolidated statements of operations. Mattel utilizes derivative contracts to hedge certain purchases of commodities, which were not material.
Revenue Recognition and Sales Adjustments
Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which is either upon shipment or upon receipt of finished goods by the customer, depending on the contract terms, with payment due typically within 60 days from the invoice date. Mattel routinely enters into arrangements with its customers to provide sales incentives, support customer promotions, and allowances for returns or defective merchandise. Such programs are based primarily on customer purchases, customer performance of specified promotional activities, and other specified factors such as sales to consumers. Accruals for these programs are recorded in net sales as sales adjustments that reduce gross billings in the period the related sale is recognized. 
The accrual for such programs, which can either be contractual or discretionary in nature, is based on an assessment of customer purchases, customer performance of specified promotional activities, and other specified factors such as customer sales volume. In making these estimates, management considers all available information, including the overall business environment, historical trends, and information from customers.
Mattel also enters into symbolic and functional licensing arrangements, whereby the licensee pays Mattel royalties based on sales of licensed product, and in certain cases are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts. The timing of revenue recognition for certain of these licensing arrangements with minimum guarantees is based on the determination of whether the license of intellectual property ("IP") is symbolic, which includes the license of Mattel's brands, or functional, which includes the license of Mattel's completed television or streaming content. 
Revenues from symbolic licenses of IP are recognized based on actual sales when Mattel expects royalties to exceed the minimum guarantee. For symbolic licensing arrangements in which Mattel does not expect royalties to exceed the minimum guarantee, an estimate of the royalties expected to be recouped is recognized on a straight-line basis over the license term.
Revenues from functional licenses of IP are recognized once the license period has commenced and the licensee has the ability to use the delivered content.
Mattel does not evaluate contracts of one year or less for the existence of a significant financing component. Multi-year contracts were not material.

Advertising and Promotion Costs
Advertising production costs are expensed in the period the underlying advertisement is first aired. The costs of other advertising and promotional programs are expensed in the period incurred.
57
Product Recalls and Withdrawals
Mattel establishes a reserve for product recalls and withdrawals on a product-specific basis when circumstances giving rise to the recall or withdrawal become known. Facts and circumstances related to the recall or withdrawal, including where the product affected by the recall or withdrawal is located (e.g., with consumers, in customers' inventory, or in Mattel's inventory), cost estimates for shipping and handling for returns, cost estimates for communicating the recall or withdrawal to consumers and customers, and cost estimates for parts and labor if the recalled or withdrawn product is deemed to be repairable, are considered when establishing a product recall or withdrawal reserve. These factors are updated and reevaluated each period, and the related reserves are adjusted when these factors indicate that the recall or withdrawal reserve is either not sufficient to cover or exceeds the estimated product recall or withdrawal expenses.
Design and Development Costs
Product design and development costs primarily include employee compensation and outside services and are expensed in the period incurred.
Employee Benefit Plans
Mattel and certain of its subsidiaries have retirement and other postretirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees of these entities. Actuarial valuations are used in determining amounts recognized in the financial statements for certain retirement and other postretirement benefit plans (see "Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Employee Benefit Plans").
Share-Based Payments
Mattel recognizes the cost of service-based employee share-based payment awards on a straight-line attribution basis over the requisite employee service period, net of estimated forfeitures. 
Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the measurement date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility, and the expected dividends. Mattel estimates the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected life of stock options used in this calculation is the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and has been determined based on historical exercise experience. Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of Mattel's stock for a period approximating the expected life. Expected dividend yield is based on the annual rate of dividends expected to be paid over the expected life. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues approximating the expected life. Mattel estimates and adjusts forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover.
Mattel determines the fair value of restricted stock units ("RSUs"), excluding performance RSUs, based on the closing market price of Mattel's common stock on the date of grant, adjusted by the present value of the expected dividends for RSUs that are not entitled to a dividend during the vest period.
Mattel determines the fair value of the performance-related components of its performance RSUs based on the closing market price of Mattel's common stock on the date of grant. It determines the fair value of the market-related components of its performance RSUs based on the Monte Carlo valuation methodology.

Income Taxes
Certain income and expense items are accounted for differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory income tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Mattel evaluates the realization of its deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establishes a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized.
Mattel recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, Mattel recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.
58
In the normal course of business, Mattel is regularly audited by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. The ultimate settlement of any particular issue with the applicable taxing authority could have a material impact on Mattel's consolidated financial statements.

Equity Method Investments
Mattel utilizes the equity method when accounting for investments in which Mattel is able to exercise significant influence, but does not hold a controlling interest. Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when Mattel owns between 20% to 50% of the investee. Under the equity method of accounting, the initial equity investment is recorded at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is subsequently adjusted for Mattel's share of net income (loss) and distributions from the investee. 
Mattel owns a 
50
% equity interest in Mattel163 Limited, a joint venture with a third party that develops and operates online games. Mattel's portion of the joint venture's earnings and losses is recognized on a three-month lag as the joint venture's financial information is not available in a sufficiently timely manner. The joint venture was not significant for the periods presented.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    
In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2022-04, Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. ASU 2022-04 requires that buyers in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of the financial statements to understand the program's nature, potential magnitude, obligations outstanding at the end of each period, and an annual rollforward of such obligations. The guidance in ASU 2022-04 was effective for interim and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The annual rollforward was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Refer to "Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Supplier Finance Program" for additional information regarding Mattel's supplier finance program, including the annual rollforward. The adoption of this new accounting standard did not have a material impact on Mattel's consolidated financial statements.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. ASU 2023-07 requires incremental disclosure of significant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses. The guidance in ASU 2023-07 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Mattel adopted the guidance in ASU 2023-07 effective January 1, 2024 and applied the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Refer to "Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Segment Information" for additional information regarding Mattel's Segments. The adoption of this new accounting standard did not have a material impact on Mattel's consolidated financial statements. 
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 requires enhanced income tax disclosures on an annual basis for specific categories in the rate reconciliation and disclosure of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The guidance in ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Mattel is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses for public business entities. ASU 2024-03 requires enhanced disclosures of each expense caption in the income statement to improve transparency and provide financial statement users with more detailed information about the nature, amount and timing of expenses impacting financial performance. The guidance in ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Mattel is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2024-03 on its consolidated financial statements.

In July 2024, Mattel completed the purchase of an office building located in El Segundo, California for cash consideration of $
58.8
 million. The building totals approximately 
168,000
 square feet and, upon completion of an interior build-out, will replace a currently leased facility that supports Mattel's global design and development and other activities. The building will support the North America and International segments.

Note 3—
Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net
Goodwill
Mattel's reporting units are (i) North America, which consists of the United States and Canada, (ii) International, and (iii) American Girl. In the first quarter of 2024, Mattel implemented an organizational change integrating the American Girl business into Mattel's North America commercial organization. Such integration resulted in a change to Mattel's operating and reportable segments. Goodwill related to the American Girl reporting unit is included in the North America operating segment. Mattel's reportable segments are: (i) North America and (ii) International. 
The change in the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting unit for 2024 and 2023 is shown below. Brand-specific goodwill held by foreign subsidiaries is allocated to the North America reporting unit selling those brands, thereby causing a foreign currency translation impact.

In the third quarter of 2024, Mattel performed its annual goodwill impairment test and determined that goodwill was 
not
 impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment assessment includes the use of certain assumptions and estimates to calculate the estimated fair value of Mattel's reporting units. To the extent assumptions, estimations, or market factors, including seasonality, differ from Mattel's current estimates, the estimated fair value of Mattel's reporting units may be susceptible to significant changes. The reporting unit that is most susceptible to changes in assumptions and estimates, given its smaller size, is American Girl, as excess fair value over carrying value is a lesser dollar and percentage value than the other reporting units. There were no events or changes in circumstances subsequent to the third quarter assessment that indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value as of December 31, 2024.

Mattel tests its amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Mattel's amortizable intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks and trade names. During 2024, 2023, and 2022, Mattel's 
amortizable intangible assets
 were 
not
 impaired.

Employee Benefit Plans
Mattel and certain of its subsidiaries have qualified and nonqualified retirement plans covering substantially all employees of these companies. These plans include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution retirement plans, postretirement benefit plans, and deferred compensation and excess benefit plans. In addition, Mattel makes contributions to government-mandated retirement plans in countries outside the United States where its employees work.

Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans
Mattel provides defined benefit pension plans for eligible domestic employees, which are intended to comply with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"). Some of Mattel's foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their eligible employees. Mattel funds these plans in accordance with the terms of the plans and local statutory requirements, which differ for each of the countries in which the subsidiaries are located. Mattel also has unfunded postretirement health insurance plans covering certain eligible domestic employees.

Discount rates, weighted-average rates of future compensation increases, and long-term rates of return on plan assets for Mattel's foreign defined benefit pension plans differ from the assumptions used for Mattel's domestic defined benefit pension plans due to differences in local economic conditions in the locations where the non-U.S. plans are based. The rates shown in the preceding table are indicative of the weighted-average rates of all of Mattel's defined benefit pension plans given the relative insignificance of the foreign plans to the consolidated total.
Mattel used a measurement date of December 31, 2024 for its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans.

The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that it assumes future compensation levels will remain unchanged. Mattel's accumulated benefit obligation for its defined benefit pension plans as of 2024 and 2023 totaled $
409.6
 million and $
445.2
 million, respectively.
63
The actuarial gain recognized in 2024 for the defined benefit pension plan was driven primarily by the decrease in the discount rate from the prior year that was used to determine the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2024. 
The actuarial loss recognized in 2023 for the defined benefit pension plan was driven primarily by the increase in the discount rate from the prior year that was used to determine the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2023.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, information for defined benefit pension plans that had aggregate accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets is as follows:

Discount rates, weighted-average rates of future compensation increases, and long-term rates of return on plan assets for Mattel's foreign defined benefit pension plans differ from the assumptions used for Mattel's domestic defined benefit pension plans due to differences in local economic conditions in the locations where the non-U.S. plans are based. The rates shown in the preceding table are indicative of the weighted-average rates of all of Mattel's defined benefit pension plans given the relative insignificance of the foreign plans to the consolidated total.
At the end of each fiscal year, Mattel determines the weighted-average discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation. The discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the benefit plan liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The discount rate also impacts the interest cost component of plan income or expense. As of December 31, 2024, Mattel determined the discount rate for its domestic defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans used in determining the projected and accumulated benefit obligations to be 
5.3
%, as compared to 
4.7
% as of December 31, 2023. In estimating this rate, Mattel reviews rates of return on high-quality corporate bond indices, which approximate the timing and amount of benefit payments.

Mattel expects to make cash contributions totaling approximately $
21
 million to its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans in 2025, substantially all of which will be for benefit payments for its underfunded plans.
Mattel periodically commissions a study of the plans' assets and liabilities to determine an asset allocation that would best match expected cash flows from the plans' assets to expected benefit payments. Mattel monitors the returns earned by the plans' assets and reallocates investments as needed. Mattel's overall investment strategy is to achieve an adequately diversified asset allocation mix of investments that provides for both near-term benefit payments as well as long-term growth. The assets are invested in a combination of indexed and actively managed funds. The target allocations for Mattel's domestic plan assets, which comprise 
79
% of Mattel's total plan assets, are 
42
% in U.S. equities, 
28
% in non-U.S. equities, 
20
% in fixed income securities, and 
10
% in real estate securities. The U.S. equities are benchmarked against the S&P 500, and the non-U.S. equities are benchmarked against a combination of developed and emerging markets indices. Fixed income securities are long-duration bonds intended to closely match the duration of the liabilities and include U.S. government treasuries and agencies, corporate bonds from various industries, and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. 
65
Mattel's defined benefit pension plan assets are measured and reported in the consolidated financial statements at fair value using inputs, which are more fully described in "Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Fair Value Measurements," as follows:

    These investments primarily consist of privately placed funds that are valued based on net asset value per share. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets and its related disclosures.
The fair value of collective trust funds is determined based on the net asset value per share held at year-end. The fair value of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, corporate debt instruments, mutual funds, and money market funds are determined based on quoted market prices or are estimated using pricing models with observable inputs or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.

In December 2017, Mattel entered into an insurance buy-in policy contract with a private limited life insurance company to insure a portion of the U.K. pension plan, which initially covered approximately 
40
% of the total membership in the plan. In 2022, Mattel entered into an additional insurance buy-in policy contract to insure the remainder of the membership in the plan. The assets and liabilities with respect to insured pensioners are assumed to match for the purposes of Accounting Standards Codification 715, 
Pension 
—
 Retirement Benefits
 (i.e. the full benefits have been insured). The initial value of the asset associated with this policy was equal to the premium paid to secure the policy, and is adjusted each reporting period for changes in interest rates, discount rates, and benefits paid. As the valuation of this asset is judgmental, and there are no observable inputs associated with the valuation, the buy-in contract is classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of insurance buy-in policy contract assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):

Mattel's domestic defined benefit pension plan assets are not directly invested in Mattel common stock. Mattel believes that the long-term rate of return on plan assets of 
6.2
% as of December 31, 2024 is reasonable based on historical returns.
Defined Contribution Retirement Plans
Domestic employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, the Mattel, Inc. Personal Investment Plan (the "Plan"), sponsored by Mattel, which is a funded defined contribution plan intended to comply with ERISA's requirements. Contributions to the Plan include voluntary contributions by eligible employees and employer automatic and matching contributions by Mattel. The Plan allows employees to allocate both their voluntary contributions and their employer automatic and matching contributions to a variety of investment funds, including a fund that is invested in Mattel common stock (the "Mattel Stock Fund"). Employees are not required to allocate any of their Plan account balance to the Mattel Stock Fund, allowing employees to limit or eliminate their exposure to market changes in Mattel's stock price. Furthermore, the Plan limits the percentage of the employee's total account balance that may be allocated to the Mattel Stock Fund to 
25
%. Employees may generally reallocate their account balances on a daily basis. However, pursuant to Mattel's insider trading policy, employees classified as insiders under Mattel's insider trading policy are limited to certain periods in which they may make allocations into or out of the Mattel Stock Fund.
Certain non-U.S. employees participate in other defined contribution retirement plans with varying vesting and contribution provisions.
Deferred Compensation and Excess Benefit Plans
Mattel maintains a deferred compensation and 401(k) excess plan (the "DCP") that permits certain officers and key employees to elect to defer portions of their compensation. The participant DCP deferrals, together with certain contributions made by Mattel, earn various rates of return. The liability for these plans as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
56.9
 million and $
53.3
 million, respectively, and is primarily included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the market value of the participant-selected investment options are recorded as retirement plan expense within other selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Separately, Mattel has purchased group trust-owned life insurance contracts designed to assist in funding these benefits under the DCP. The cash surrender value of these policies, valued at $
97.1
 million and $
87.1
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are held in an irrevocable guarantor trust, the assets of which are subject to the claims of Mattel's creditors and are included in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
67
Annual Incentive Compensation 
Mattel has an annual incentive compensation plan under which officers and key employees may earn cash incentive compensation based on Mattel's and individual performance, subject to certain approvals of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Incentive compensation for 2024 and 2023 were $
150.9
 million and $
137.8
 million, respectively, for awards under the plan and were included in other selling and administrative expenses. During 2022, Mattel did 
not
 achieve threshold performance under the plan, and therefore, no cash payout was earned.

Note 5—
Supplier Finance Program
Mattel has an agreement with a third-party financial institution that allows certain participating suppliers the opportunity to voluntarily finance payment obligations of Mattel under a supplier finance program. Under this program, participating suppliers may accelerate the timing of collection of their receivables due from Mattel, prior to their scheduled due dates, by selling one or more of their receivables at a discounted price to the third-party financial institution. The range of payment terms Mattel negotiates with suppliers are consistent, regardless of whether the suppliers participate in the supplier finance program and Mattel does not have any economic interest in any suppliers' decision to participate in the supplier finance program. Suppliers participating in the program are able to select which individual Mattel invoices they sell to the third-party financial institution. All Mattel payments of the full amounts due to participating suppliers are paid on the invoice due date based on the terms originally negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the individual invoice due to the supplier is sold to the third-party financial institution. Outstanding payment obligations due to suppliers under the supplier finance program were included in Mattel's 
accounts payable
 in the consolidated balance sheets. All payment activities related to the supplier finance program were presented within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Seasonal Financing and Debt
Seasonal Financing 
On July 15, 2024, Mattel entered into a revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), among Mattel, as the borrower, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders and financial institutions party thereto, providing for $
1.40
 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured revolving credit facilities (the "Credit Facility"). The Credit Facility matures on July 15, 2029. In connection with the Credit Facility, Mattel terminated the commitments and satisfied all outstanding obligations under Mattel's prior revolving credit agreement, dated as of September 15, 2022 (as amended), among Mattel, as the borrower, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and the other lenders and financial institutions party thereto, which provided for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $
1.40
 billion.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate, which for U.S. Dollar-denominated loans can be, at Mattel's option, either (a) Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 
0.875
% to 
1.375
% per annum, or (b) Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 
0.000
% to 
0.375
% per annum, in each case, such applicable margins to be determined based on Mattel's debt rating.
In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Credit Facility, Mattel is required to pay (i) an unused line fee per annum of the average daily unused portion of the Credit Facility, (ii) a letter of credit fronting fee based on a percentage of the aggregate face amount of outstanding letters of credit, and (iii) certain other customary fees and expenses of the lenders and agents. 
68
The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, (a) restrictions on Mattel's and its subsidiaries' ability to merge and consolidate with other companies, dispose of all or substantially all assets, incur indebtedness, or grant liens or other security interests on assets, in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions and (b) the requirement that the obligations of Mattel under the Credit Facility be guaranteed by any existing or future direct or indirect domestic subsidiary of Mattel that guarantees other indebtedness of Mattel in an aggregate principal or committed amount in excess of $
50
 million, subject to certain customary exceptions. As of December 31, 2024, no subsidiaries of Mattel were required to guarantee the Credit Facility.
The Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of (a) an interest coverage ratio of not less than 
2.75
 to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter and (b) a total leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter, not to exceed (x) 
3.75
 to 1.00 with respect to fiscal quarters ending on March 31, June 30 and December 31 of each year, and (y) 
4.00
 to 1.00 with respect to fiscal quarters ending on September 30 of each year. The total leverage ratio financial covenant is subject to a step-up to 
4.25
 to 1.00, with respect to fiscal quarters in which certain material acquisitions are consummated, and for a period of four fiscal quarters thereafter, and subject to certain customary exceptions.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Mattel had 
no
 borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the prior credit facility, respectively. Outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility and the prior credit facility totaled approximately $
9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
To finance seasonal working capital requirements of certain foreign subsidiaries, Mattel avails itself of individual short-term credit lines. As of December 31, 2024, foreign credit lines totaled approximately $
18
 million. Mattel expects to extend the majority of these credit lines throughout 2025.
As of December 31, 2024, Mattel was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement is a material agreement, and failure to comply with its covenants may result in an event of default under the terms of the Credit Facility. If Mattel were to default under the terms of the Credit Facility, its ability to meet its seasonal financing requirements could be adversely affected.
Short-Term Borrowings
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Mattel had 
no
 short-term borrowings outstanding. 
During 2024 and 2023, Mattel had no borrowings under the Credit Facility and prior credit facility, and no other short-term borrowings.

Mattel's 2019 Senior Notes due 2027 were issued pursuant to an indenture dated November 20, 2019, and its 2021 Senior Notes due 2026 and 2021 Senior Notes due 2029 were issued pursuant to an indenture dated March 19, 2021. These indentures contain covenants that limit Mattel's (and some of its subsidiaries') ability to, among other things: (i) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; (ii) pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of their capital stock or make other restricted payments; (iii) make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries; (iv) create liens; (v) enter into certain sale/leaseback transactions; (vi) merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of substantially all of their assets; and (vii) designate future guarantors. The indentures also provided that certain of these covenants would be suspended if Mattel achieved a debt rating of BBB-, Baa3, and/or BBB- (or higher) from any two of S&P, Moody's, and Fitch, respectively, and no event of default has occurred. 
In 2024, Fitch changed Mattel's credit rating from BB+ to BBB- with a stable outlook, S&P changed Mattel's credit rating from BBB- to BBB with a stable outlook, and Moody's maintained Mattel's credit rating of Baa3 with a stable outlook. As a result of the current credit ratings and no events of default, the covenants limiting Mattel's ability to incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares, pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock or make other restricted payments, and make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries, and certain provisions of the covenant limiting Mattel's ability to merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of substantially all of its assets and designate future guarantors, are suspended. If Mattel ceases to have credit ratings of BBB-, Baa3, and/or BBB- (or higher) from any two of S&P, Moody's, and Fitch, respectively, Mattel will thereafter be subject to the suspended covenants with respect to future events. 
On December 30, 2022, Mattel used cash on hand to redeem and retire the $
250
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2013 Senior Notes due 2023.
The aggregate principal amount of long-term debt maturing in the next five years and thereafter is as follows:

The amortization of prior service credit, recognized actuarial (loss), curtailment gain (loss) and settlement gain (loss) are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost. Refer to "Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Employee Benefit Plans" for additional information regarding Mattel's net periodic benefit cost.
(b)
There is no tax effect associated with the loss on the liquidation of Mattel's subsidiary in Argentina.

During 2022, Mattel adjusted accumulated other comprehensive loss by $
6.4
 million in relation to previously recorded available-for-sale equity securities. This amount was adjusted in order to account for such securities in a manner consistent with Accounting Standards Codification 321, Investments—Equity Securities. The adjustment included $
3.6
 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss reclassified to other non-operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statement of operations and $
2.8
 million reclassified to retained earnings in the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity. The adjustment, including tax effect, was immaterial to the financial statements.
Currency Translation Adjustments
During 2024, currency translation adjustments resulted in a net other comprehensive loss of $
110.5
 million, primarily due to the weakening of the Mexican peso, Russian ruble, and Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar.
During 2023, currency translation adjustments resulted in a net other comprehensive gain of $
37.1
 million, primarily due to the strengthening of the Mexican peso and British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar
73
During 2022, currency translation adjustments resulted in a net other comprehensive loss of $
51.6
 million, primarily due to the weakening of the British pound sterling, Euro, and Hong Kong dollar against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the Mexican peso and Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. Upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign entity, the accumulated currency translation adjustment related to the foreign entity is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the liquidation of Mattel's subsidiary in Argentina was substantially complete and as a result, $
45.4
 million of accumulated currency translation losses were recognized in other non-operating expense, net within the consolidated statement of operations.

Note 9—
Share-Based Payments
Mattel Stock Plans
The 2010 Equity and Long-Term Compensation Plan was initially approved by Mattel's stockholders in May 2010, and most recently amended in May 2024 by Mattel's stockholders (the "Amended 2010 Plan"). 
Under the Amended 2010 Plan, Mattel has the ability to grant nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, performance RSUs ("performance awards"), dividend equivalent rights, and shares of common stock to officers, employees, non-employee directors, and consultants providing services to Mattel. The Amended 2010 Plan also contains provisions regarding grants of equity compensation to the non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The Amended 2010 Plan expires on March 21, 2034, except as to any grants then outstanding.
Nonqualified stock options are granted with an exercise price not less than 
100
% of the fair market value of Mattel's common stock on the date of grant, expire no later than 
10
 years from the date of grant, and vest on a schedule determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, generally over a period of 
three years
 from the date of grant. Nonqualified stock options generally vest and become exercisable contingent upon the grantees' continued employment or service with Mattel. In the event of a retirement, or an involuntary termination, of an employee that meets retirement provisions under the Amended 2010 Plan, or the death or disability of an employee, that occurs in each case at least 
six months
 after the grant-date, nonqualified stock options become fully vested. In the event of an involuntary termination, an employee has 
90
 days to exercise vested options.
RSUs granted under the Amended 2010 Plan vest on a schedule determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, generally over a period of 
three years
 from the date of grant. In the event of the involuntary termination of an employee that meets retirement provisions under the Amended 2010 Plan, or the death or disability of an employee, that occurs at least 
six months
 after the grant-date, RSUs become fully vested. 
Performance awards granted under the Amended 2010 Plan vest upon achievement of performance conditions at a settlement date determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which occurs in the first quarter subsequent the performance cycle. In the event of a retirement of an employee that meets retirement provisions under the Amended 2010 Plan, or the death or disability of an employee, that occurs in each case at least 
six months
 after the start date of the performance period, performance awards vest at the settlement date. In each case, vested performance awards are determined upon the achievement of performance conditions over the performance period, which is then prorated for the period of employment as a percentage of the performance period. 
An employee qualifies for retirement provisions under the Amended 2010 Plan if; aged 
55
 years or older with 
5
 or more years of service for grants prior to April 28, 2023, or aged 
55
 years or older with 
10
 or more years of service for grants on or after April 28, 2023, which includes Mattel's 2023 annual employee grant. 
75
The number of shares of common stock available for grant under the Amended 2010 Plan is subject to an aggregate limit as defined therein. At December 31, 2024, there were approximately 
27
 million shares available for grant under the Amended 2010 Plan if target performance goals are achieved, and approximately 
23
 million shares available if maximum performance goals are achieved.
Mattel recognized total share-based compensation expense related to stock options, RSUs, and performance awards of $
79.4
 million, $
83.3
 million, and $
69.1
 million during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which is included in other selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The income tax benefit related to stock options, RSUs, and performance awards during 2024, 2023, and 2022 was approximately $
9
 million, $
10
 million and $
9
 million, respectively. 
As of December 31, 2024, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based payments totaled $
120.9
 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
2.3
 years.
Stock Options
Mattel recognized compensation expense of $
3.1
 million, $
6.7
 million, and $
13.2
 million for stock options during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which is included within other selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
The fair values of options granted have been estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected life of stock options used in this calculation is the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and has been determined based on historical exercise experience. Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of Mattel's stock for a period approximating the expected life. Expected dividend yield is based on the annual rate of dividends expected to be paid over the expected life. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues approximating the expected life.

The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the current market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was approximately $
2
 million, $
9
 million and $
8
 million, during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2024, options outstanding had an intrinsic value of approximately $
18
 million with a weighted-average remaining life of 
3.5
 years. At December 31, 2024, options exercisable had an intrinsic value of approximately $
18
 million, with a weighted-average remaining life of 
3.3
 years. Mattel uses treasury shares purchased under its share repurchase program to satisfy stock option exercises. Cash received from stock options exercised, net of taxes during 2024 was approximately $
6
 million.
76
At December 31, 2024, stock options vested and expected to vest totaled approximately 
11
 million shares, with an intrinsic value of approximately $
18
 million, weighted-average exercise price of $
19.69
, and weighted-average remaining life of 
3.5
 years. During 2024, approximately 
1
 million stock options vested. The total grant-date fair value of stock options vested during 2024, 2023, and 2022 was approximately $
6
 million, $
9
 million, and $
9
 million, respectively. 
Restricted Stock Units
Compensation expense recognized related to grants of RSUs was $
55.2
 million, $
48.5
 million, and $
37.7
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and was included within other selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
RSUs are valued at the market value on the date of grant, adjusted by the present value of the expected dividends for RSUs that are not entitled to a dividend during the vesting period. The expense for RSUs is evenly attributed to the periods in which the restrictions lapse, which is generally 
three years
 from the date of grant.

Performance Awards
Compensation expense recognized related to grants of performance awards was $
21.2
 million, $
28.1
 million, and $
18.2
 million during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Performance awards were comprised of Mattel's long-term incentive program ("LTIP") and a one-time retention award of performance-based restricted stock units (the "Retention Performance Grant"). 
Mattel had 
four
 LTIP performance cycles in place during 2024, which were established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors: (i) a January 1, 2021—December 31, 2023 ("2021 LTIP"), which was completed in the first quarter of 2024 (ii) a January 1, 2022—December 31, 2024 performance cycle ("2022 LTIP"), (ii) a January 1, 2023—December 31, 2025 performance cycle ("2023 LTIP"), and (iii) a January 1, 2024—December 31, 2026 performance cycle ("2024 LTIP"). Under the LTIP performance cycles in place in 2024, officers and key employees may earn shares of Mattel's common stock based on attaining certain cumulative 
three-year
 performance targets, which are subject to approvals of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The ultimate amount of shares earned for these LTIP awards may vary from 
0
% to 
200
% of the target number of shares, depending on the cumulative results achieved.
On September 30, 2024, the Retention Performance Grant was granted to Ynon Kreiz, Mattel's Chief Executive Officer, in order to incentivize retention and drive significant stock price performance and market outperformance. The Retention Performance Grant has targeted approximately 
0.8
 million performance-based restricted stock units granted under the Plan, which was determined based on a target value of $
15.0
 million divided by the closing price of Mattel's common stock on the grant date. The Retention Performance Grant is 
100
% performance-based, with 
50
% of the Retention Performance Grant subject to vesting based on the achievement of the stock price hurdles during the final 
three years
 of the 
five-year
 performance measurement period, and the remaining 
50
% of the Retention Performance Grant subject to vesting based on Mattel's relative Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") over the 
five-year
 performance measurement period. 
No portion of the Retention Performance Grant will be earned unless Mattel achieves rigorous performance goals and Mr. Kreiz remains employed through the settlement date following the completion of a 
five-year
 vesting period from September 30, 2024 to September 30, 2029, subject to potential acceleration upon certain qualifying terminations of employment. The grant also allows for a maximum potential earnout of 
200
% of the targeted number of performance-based restricted stock units.
77
Mattel determines the fair value of the performance-related components of its performance awards based on the closing market price of Mattel's common stock on the date of grant and determines the fair value of the market-related components of its performance awards based on the Monte Carlo valuation methodology. The LTIP awards cliff-vest at the end of the requisite service period, which typically occurs in the first quarter subsequent to the end of the performance period. Mattel recognizes compensation expense for its LTIP awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, provided that certain cumulative 
three-year
 performance targets and other vesting criteria are met. The Retention Performance Grant has a 
five-year
 vesting period from September 30, 2024 to September 30, 2029, which will be recognized straight-line over the service period. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of performance awards granted during 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $
21.97
, $
19.44
, and $
28.39
 respectively.

Fair Value Measurements
The following tables present information about Mattel's assets and liabilities measured and reported in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
•
Level 1 – Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.
•
Level 2 – Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
•
Level 3 – Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity, and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

(a)
The fair value of the foreign currency forward exchange and other contracts was based on dealer quotes of market forward rates and reflects the amount that Mattel would receive or pay at their maturity dates for contracts involving the same notional amounts, currencies, and maturity dates.
Other Financial Instruments
Mattel's financial instruments included cash and equivalents, accounts receivable and payable, accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. The fair values of these instruments, excluding long-term debt, approximate their carrying amounts because of their short-term nature. Cash and equivalents were classified as Level 1 and all other financial instruments were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
The estimated fair value of Mattel's long-term debt was $
2.27
 billion (compared to a carrying amount of $
2.35
 billion) as of December 31, 2024 and $
2.23
 billion (compared to a carrying amount of $
2.35
 billion) as of December 31, 2023. The estimated fair values have been calculated based on broker quotes or rates for the same or similar instruments and were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
Note 12—
Derivative Instruments
Mattel seeks to mitigate its exposure to foreign currency transaction risk by monitoring its foreign currency transaction exposure for the year and partially hedging such exposure using foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Mattel uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges primarily to hedge its purchases and sales of inventory denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts have maturity dates of up to 
24
 months. These derivative instruments have been designated as effective cash flow hedges, whereby the unsettled hedges are reported in Mattel's consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the hedges reflected in other comprehensive income ("OCI"). Realized gains and losses for these contracts are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the inventory is sold to customers. Mattel uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge intercompany loans and advances denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the short-term nature of the contracts involved, Mattel does not use hedge accounting for these contracts, and as such, changes in fair value are recorded in the period of change in the consolidated statements of operations. Mattel utilizes derivative contracts to hedge certain purchases of commodities, which were not material. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Mattel held foreign currency forward exchange contracts and other commodity derivative instruments, with notional amounts of approximately $
628
 million and $
609
 million, respectively.

Insurance
Mattel has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Far West Insurance Company, Ltd. ("Far West"), that was established to insure Mattel's workers' compensation, general, automobile, product liability, and property risks. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Far West insured the first $
1.0
 million per occurrence for workers' compensation risks, the first $
0.5
 million per occurrence for general and automobile liability risks, the first $
2.0
 million per occurrence for product liability losses occurring prior to February 1, 2020, and the first $
5.0
 million per occurrence for product liability risks thereafter, and up to $
1.0
 million per occurrence for property risks. Various insurance companies that have an "A" or better AM Best rating at the time the policies are purchased reinsured Mattel's risk in excess of the amounts insured by Far West. Mattel's liability for workers' compensation, general, automobile, product liability, and property claims at December 31, 2024 and 2023 totaled $
12.0
 million and $
12.2
 million, respectively, and is primarily included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Loss reserves are accrued based on Mattel's estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred.
Litigation
Litigation Related to Yellowstone do Brasil Ltda. 
In April 1999, Yellowstone do Brasil Ltda. (formerly known as Trebbor Informática Ltda.) filed a lawsuit against Mattel do Brasil before the 15th Civil Court of Curitiba, State of Parana, requesting the annulment of its security bonds and promissory notes given to Mattel do Brasil as well as damages due to an alleged breach of an oral exclusive distribution agreement between the parties relating to the supply and sale of toys in Brazil. Yellowstone's complaints sought alleged loss of profits plus an unspecified amount of damages. 
Mattel do Brasil filed its defenses to these claims and simultaneously presented a counterclaim for unpaid accounts receivable for goods supplied to Yellowstone. 
In April 2018, Mattel do Brasil entered into a settlement agreement to resolve this matter, but the settlement remains the subject of ongoing appeals. 
In October 2018, the Superior Court of Justice issued a final ruling in favor of Yellowstone on the merits of Yellowstone's claims. Previously, the courts had ruled in Mattel's favor on its counterclaim. 
In October 2019, Mattel reached an agreement with Yellowstone's former counsel regarding payment of the attorney's fees portion of the judgment. In November 2019, Yellowstone initiated an action to enforce its judgment against Mattel, but did not account for an offset for Mattel's counterclaim. In January 2020, Mattel obtained an injunction, staying Yellowstone's enforcement action pending resolution of Mattel's appeal to enforce the parties' April 2018 settlement. As of December 31, 2024, Mattel assessed its probable loss related to this matter and has accrued an estimated liability, which is not material. 
Litigation Related to the Fisher-Price Rock 'n Play Sleeper
A number of putative class action lawsuits filed between April 2019 and October 2019 are pending against Fisher-Price, Inc. and/or Mattel, Inc. asserting claims for false advertising, negligent product design, breach of warranty, fraud, and other claims in connection with the marketing and sale of the Fisher-Price Rock 'n Play Sleeper (the "Sleeper"). In general, the lawsuits allege that the Sleeper should not have been marketed and sold as safe and fit for prolonged and overnight sleep for infants. The putative class action lawsuits propose nationwide and over 
10
 statewide consumer classes comprised of those who purchased the Sleeper as marketed as safe for prolonged and overnight sleep. The class actions have been consolidated before a single judge in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York for pre-trial purposes pursuant to the U.S. federal courts' Multi-District Litigation program. In June 2022, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion to certify damages and injunctive relief classes under New York law, but granted plaintiffs' request to certify a New York issue class to resolve 
two
 issues on a class-wide basis. In October 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied plaintiffs' petition to appeal the denial of certification of the damages and injunctive relief classes. On July 24, 2024, the parties filed a settlement agreement with the court to resolve this litigation. On August 9, 2024, the settlement was preliminarily approved by the court. A final approval hearing is scheduled for February 28, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, Mattel assessed its probable loss related to this matter and has accrued an estimated liability, which is not material. 
Twenty-seven
 additional lawsuits filed between April 2019 and September 2024 are pending against Fisher-Price, Inc. and Mattel, Inc. alleging that a product defect in the Sleeper caused the fatalities of or injuries to 
twenty-seven
 children. More than 
thirty
 lawsuits have been settled and/or dismissed. As of December 31,2024, Mattel assessed its probable loss related to these matters and estimated a liability where appropriate, which is not material. Additionally, Fisher-Price, Inc. and/or Mattel, Inc. have also received letters from lawyers purporting to represent additional plaintiffs who have threatened to assert similar claims.
83
In addition, a stockholder has filed a derivative action in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware (Kumar v. Bradley, et al., filed July 7, 2020) alleging breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment related to the development, marketing, and sale of the Sleeper. The defendants in the derivative action are certain of Mattel's current and former officers and directors. In August 2021, a second similar derivative action was filed in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware (Armon v. Bradley, et al., filed August 30, 2021). The parties have reached a settlement in principle of this litigation, which is subject to approval by the court. As of December 31, 2024, Mattel has determined that a recovery of prior losses in this matter is probable and has accrued for the estimated amount, which is not material.
The lawsuits seek compensatory damages, punitive damages, statutory damages, restitution, disgorgement, attorneys' fees, costs, interest, declaratory relief, and/or injunctive relief. Mattel believes that it has substantial defenses to the allegations in the lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend against them.
Litigation Related to the Fisher-Price Snuga Swings
Purported class action lawsuits against Fisher-Price, Inc. and Mattel, Inc. were filed in United States District Courts for the Western District of New York (Bigelow v. Mattel, Inc., et al., filed October 17, 2024, Wall v. Mattel, Inc., et al., filed October 25, 2024, and Spencer v. Fisher-Price, Inc., et al., filed February 14, 2025), and the Central District of California (Shahbaz v. Fisher-Price, Inc., et al., filed October 24, 2024, and Gates, et al. v. Fisher-Price, Inc., et al. filed November 18, 2024). The 
two
 lawsuits filed in the Central District of California have since been transferred to the Western District of New York. The lawsuits assert claims for false advertising, breach of contract, breach of warranty, fraud, negligence, and other claims in connection with the marketing and sale of Fisher-Price Snuga Swings (the "Swings"). In general, the lawsuits allege that the Swings were falsely marketed and sold as safe for infant use, particularly infant sleep, and failed to disclose a risk of suffocation. The lawsuits propose nationwide and several state consumer classes comprised of those who purchased Swings.
The lawsuits seek unspecified compensatory damages, punitive and treble damages, statutory damages, restitution, rescission, disgorgement, attorneys' fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. Mattel believes that it has substantial defenses to the allegations in the lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend against them. A reasonable estimate of the amount of any possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time.

Segment Information
Mattel designs, manufactures, and markets a broad variety of toy products worldwide, which are sold to its customers and directly to consumers.
Segment Data
In the first quarter of 2024, Mattel implemented an organizational change that resulted in the American Girl business being integrated into Mattel's North America commercial organization. Such integration resulted in a change to Mattel's operating and reportable segments. Mattel's reportable segments are: (i) North America; and (ii) International. The prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The North America and International segments sell products across Mattel's categories, although some products are developed and adapted for particular international markets, and American Girl products are sold only in North America.
Mattel's reportable segments are aligned to the structure used by its Chief Executive Officer, who is also the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), to allocate resources and assess performance. Mattel's CODM evaluates segment performance based on each segment’s gross profit and operating income. The CODM also uses these metrics in the annual budgeting and quarterly forecasting process to inform decisions about allocating capital and other resources to each segment. 
The following tables present information regarding Mattel's statement of operations information by segment. 
The corporate and other category includes operating costs not allocated to individual segments, including charges related to incentive and share-based compensation, corporate headquarters functions managed on a worldwide basis, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany transactions, and certain severance and other restructuring costs. It is impracticable for Mattel to present net sales by categories, brands, or products, as trade discounts and other allowances are generally recorded in the financial accounting systems by customer.

Restructuring Charges

Optimizing for Profitable Growth
On February 7, 2024, Mattel announced the Optimizing for Profitable Growth program (the "OPG program"), a multi-year cost savings program that follows the Optimizing for Growth program (the "OFG program"), which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2023. The OPG program is designed to achieve further efficiency and cost savings opportunities, primarily within Mattel's global supply chain, including its manufacturing footprint. The OPG program includes cost savings actions in connection with discontinuing production at a plant in China as previously announced in the third quarter of 2023, as well as savings from other previous actions taken in 2023 that were not recognized in the OFG program.
87
In connection with the OPG program, Mattel recorded severance and other restructuring costs in the following cost and expense categories within operating income in the consolidated statements of operations:

In 2024, Mattel recognized a net income tax benefit of $
34.8
 million related to tax elections filed to amortize certain intangible assets transferred as part of Mattel's intra-group IP rights transfer and establishment of certain U.S. deferred tax assets.
In 2023, Mattel completed an intra-group transfer of certain IP rights, resulting in a net tax expense of $
161.4
 million related to the write-down of certain foreign deferred tax assets and establishment of certain U.S. deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in intangible deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and an increase in research and development deferred tax assets.

Evaluating the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets often requires significant judgment and extensive analysis of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that these assets will be realizable. Mattel routinely assesses the positive and negative evidence for this realizability, including the evaluation of sustained profitability and three years of cumulative pretax income for each tax jurisdiction. Changes in the valuation allowances in 2022 primarily related to utilization and expiration of tax attributes and currency fluctuations. As of December 31, 2022, Mattel's valuation allowances on its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and foreign deferred tax assets were approximately $
16
 million and $
74
 million, respectively. Changes in the valuation allowances in 2023 primarily related to changes in assessment of the future realizability of certain deferred tax assets, utilization and expiration of tax attributes, and currency fluctuations. As of December 31, 2023, Mattel's valuation allowances on its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and foreign deferred tax assets were approximately $
14
 million and $
71
 million, respectively. Changes in the valuation allowances in 2024 primarily related to changes in assessment of the future realizability of certain deferred tax assets, utilization and expiration of tax attributes. As of December 31, 2024, Mattel's valuation allowances on its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and foreign deferred tax assets were approximately $
12
 million and $
85
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Mattel has recorded net deferred tax assets of $
252.5
 million and $
243.1
 million, respectively.

In assessing whether uncertain tax positions should be recognized in its financial statements, Mattel first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold, Mattel presumes that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. For tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, Mattel measures the amount of benefit recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Mattel recognizes unrecognized tax benefits in the first financial reporting period in which information becomes available indicating that such benefits will more likely than not be realized.
Mattel records a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits for U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax positions related primarily to transfer pricing, tax credits claimed, tax nexus, and apportionment. For each reporting period, management applies a consistent methodology to measure unrecognized tax benefits, and all unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed periodically and adjusted as circumstances warrant. Mattel's measurement of its reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is based on management's assessment of all relevant information, including prior audit experience, the status of audits, conclusions of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, identification of new issues, and any administrative guidance or developments.

 million would impact the effective tax rate if recognized, $
10.0
 million would result in an increase in the valuation allowance, and $
17.2
 million would result in an offset with a non-current asset account. 
Mattel recognized a net increase of interest and penalties of $
1.7
 million in 2024, a net increase of $
1.5
 million in 2023, and a net decrease of $
5.3
 million in 2022, related to unrecognized tax benefits, which are reflected in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2024, Mattel accrued $
19.0
 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2023, Mattel accrued $
17.3
 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2022, Mattel accrued $
15.9
 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.
In the normal course of business, Mattel is regularly audited by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. Mattel remains subject to IRS examination for the 2021 through 2024 tax years. Mattel files multiple state and local income tax returns and remains subject to examination in various jurisdictions, including California for the 2019 through 2024 tax years and New York for the 2021 through 2024 tax years. Mattel files multiple foreign income tax returns and remains subject to examination in various foreign jurisdictions including Hong Kong for the 2018 through 2024 tax years, Mexico for the 2019 through 2024 tax years, Netherlands for the 2020 through 2024 tax years, and China for the 2020 through 2024 tax years. Based on the current status of U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign audits, Mattel believes it is reasonably possible that in the next 12 months, the total unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $
15.2
 million related to the settlement of tax audits and/or the expiration of statutes of limitations. The ultimate settlement of certain issues with the applicable taxing authority could have a material impact on Mattel's consolidated financial statements.
Mattel has recorded a deferred tax liability of $
22.1
 million related to undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of $
0.56
 billion as of December 31, 2024. During 2024, Mattel reported a distribution of foreign earnings to the United States for which taxes had been previously provided. Taxes have not been provided on approximately $
1.16
 billion of undistributed foreign U.S. GAAP retained earnings. The determination of any incremental tax liability associated with these earnings is not practicable due to the complexity of local country withholding rules and interactions with tax treaties, foreign exchange considerations, and the diversity of state income tax treatment on actual distribution. Mattel will remit reinvested earnings of its foreign subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has been recorded when Mattel determines that it is advantageous for business operations or cash management purposes.

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
None. 
Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer Certifications
Appearing as exhibits to this report are certifications of Mattel's principal executive officer and Mattel's principal financial officer. The certifications are required to be made by Rule 13a-14 or Rule 15d-14 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). This item contains the information about the evaluation that is referred to in the certifications, and the information set forth below in this Item 9A should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the certifications.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of December 31, 2024, Mattel's disclosure controls and procedures were evaluated, with the participation of Mattel's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to assess whether they are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Mattel in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Based on this evaluation, Ynon Kreiz, Mattel's principal executive officer, and Anthony DiSilvestro, Mattel's principal financial officer, concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of December 31, 2024 due to a material weakness in Mattel's internal control over financial reporting, as further described in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, which is included in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report and incorporated herein by reference.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The report called for by Item 308(a) of Regulation S-K is incorporated by reference to Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, included in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report.
Completed Remediation Actions
As previously disclosed in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, management identified that software program change monitoring controls were not effectively designed to detect inappropriate changes to certain information technology systems. During 2024, management designed and implemented new controls to address the identified deficiency. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, management completed its testing of the operating effectiveness of these controls and concluded that the deficiency had been remediated.
Remaining Remediation Actions
During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, management completed the design of new user access provisioning and review controls for certain systems. Additional time is required to test the operating effectiveness of these controls to demonstrate the effectiveness of the remediation efforts for those systems. Additionally, management recently identified a similar control deficiency involving the execution of user access provisioning and review controls within certain other systems. The material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively.

The report called for by Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K is incorporated by reference to Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, included in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report.
