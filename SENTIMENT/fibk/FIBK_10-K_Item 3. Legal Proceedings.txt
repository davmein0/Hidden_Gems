Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. We make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of such forward-looking statements are expressly qualified by reference to the cautionary statements provided under the caption “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included on page 1 in Part I of this report. Furthermore, a number of known and unknown factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. Therefore, you are encouraged to read in its entirety the information provided under the caption “Risk Factors” included under Item 1A in Part I of this report for a discussion of risk factors that may negatively impact our expected results, performance, or achievements discussed below.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to financial measures presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), this document contains non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding our results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found herein.
Fully-Taxable Equivalent Basis.
 Interest income, yields, and ratios on an FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on an FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent. We encourage readers to consider the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-K in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Executive Overview    
We are a financial and bank holding company headquartered in Billings, Montana. As of December 31, 2024, we had consolidated assets of $29.1 billion, deposits of $23.0 billion, loans held for investment of $17.8 billion, and total stockholders’ equity of $3.3 billion. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had 300 banking offices in operation, including branches and detached drive-up facilities, in communities across Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming. Through our bank subsidiary, FIB, we deliver a comprehensive range of banking products and services—including online and mobile banking—to individuals, businesses, governmental entities, and others throughout our market areas. Our clients participate in a wide variety of industries, including: 
•
Agriculture
•

Our Business    
Our principal business activity is lending to, accepting deposits from, and conducting financial transactions for individuals, businesses, governmental entities, and other entities located in the communities we serve. We derive our income principally from interest charged on loans and, to a lesser extent, from interest and dividends earned on fixed income investments. We also derive income from noninterest sources such as: (i) fees received in connection with various lending and deposit services; (ii) wealth management services, such as trust, employee benefit, investment, and insurance services; (iii) mortgage loan originations, sales, and servicing; (iv) merchant and electronic banking services; and (v) from time-to-time, gains on sales of assets and securities.

Table of Contents
Our principal expenses include: (i) interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings; (ii) salaries and employee benefits; (iii) information technology and communication costs primarily associated with maintaining loan and deposit functions; (iv) furniture, equipment, and occupancy expenses for maintaining our facilities; (v) professional fees, including FDIC insurance assessments; (vi) income tax expense; (vii) provisions for credit losses; (viii) intangible amortization; (ix) other real estate owned expenses; and (x) other segment expenses including legal expenses, advertising and promotion, credit card rewards expense, fees associated with originating and closing loans, insurance, and other expenses necessary to support our employees and service our clients. From time to time, we have incurred, and may incur in the future, costs related to our strategic acquisitions and other transactions.
Our loan portfolio consists of a mix of real estate, consumer, commercial, agricultural, and other loans, including fixed, adjustable, and variable rate loans. Our real estate loans comprise commercial real estate, construction (including residential, commercial, and land development construction loans), residential, agricultural, and other real estate loans. Fluctuations in the loan portfolio are directly related to the economies of the communities we serve. While each loan we originate must meet minimum underwriting standards we establish through our credit policies, our bankers are granted limited discretion to approve and price loans within pre-approved limits which assures that we are responsive to community needs in each market area and remain competitive. We fund our loan portfolio primarily with the core deposits from our clients and cash flows off of the investment portfolio. Historically, we have not relied on brokered deposits as a source of funding. We have also utilized wholesale funding sources to a limited extent. For additional information about our underwriting standards and loan approval process, see “Business—Lending Activities,” included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.
Recent Trends and Developments
Acquisition Strategy
During the past few years, we have increased our community banking footprint across the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Northwest regions and have expanded into the Midwest and Southwest regions, in large part due to our acquisition activity. While we expect to continue to evaluate bank acquisitions and other transaction opportunities in a strategic and thoughtful manner, we expect the pace of our merger and acquisition activity to decline as we focus on organic growth opportunities.
Indirect Loans
In January 2025, we announced our plans to stop originating indirect loans as of February 28, 2025, in which indirect loans are created when we purchase consumer loan contracts advanced for the purchase of automobiles, boats, and other consumer goods from the consumer product dealer network within the market areas we serve. The decision was based on the operating performance of the indirect loan business and our desire to focus our resources on relationship banking opportunities. At December 31, 2024, indirect loans represented approximately 4.0% of loan balances and 77.4% of our consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 30% to 40% of our indirect loan balances are estimated to amortize over the 12 months after we stop originating indirect loans.
Partial Charge-Off of Commercial and Industrial Loan Relationship
As previously disclosed, we recognized a material, partial charge-off of approximately $49.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 related to a single commercial and industrial loan relationship, for which a $26.5 million specific reserve was held as of September 30, 2024. As previously disclosed, on January 8, 2025, the borrower, under the control of a court-appointed receiver (the “Receiver”), entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third-party buyer pursuant to which the borrower agreed to sell substantially all of its assets to the buyer. Closing of such transaction occurred on January 21, 2025 and cash collateral retained by the Company was subsequently applied as payment. Proceeds of $16.5 million were received by the Receiver pursuant to the Purchase Agreement of which $12.5 million is expected to be applied to resolve the remaining $12.3 million balance of the commercial and industrial loan relationship in the first quarter of 2025, after giving effect to the prior charge-off in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Economic Conditions 
The Company has ample liquidity, and its capital ratios exceed all regulatory requirements to be deemed “well-capitalized” as of December 31, 2024. Our deposit base is diversified, including by depositor, which includes individuals, businesses across multiple industries, governmental units, and other entities, as well as geographically, across the communities we serve. 
As of December 31, 2024, our FDIC insured deposits consisted of 64.4% of total deposits, including accounts eligible for pass-through insurance. As of February 25, 2025, the Bank had available borrowing capacity of $4.4 billion with the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and $1.9 billion with the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) based on pledged investment securities and loan collateral.

U.S. inflation data hit a multi-decade high in June 2022, climbing to 9.1%, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, we have now seen a meaningful decrease to 2.9% as of December 2024. While our operating expenses are affected by general inflation, the asset and liability structure of the Company largely consists of monetary items. Monetary items, such as cash, investments, loans, deposits and other borrowings, are assets and liabilities which are or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in prices. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the Company’s performance than does general inflation. 
The Federal Reserve stated its current objective is to return the rate of inflation to 2.0% and it is closely monitoring the progress that has been made to achieve this goal. The Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates 525 basis points between March 16, 2022 and July 29, 2023. With general inflationary pressures easing since July 2023, the Federal Reserve had paused any further changes to short-term interest rates only to decrease them by 100 basis points between September and December 2024. While many financial industry experts have speculated that rates will decline further in the near-term, the Federal Reserve has not yet provided definitive guidance on any further changes to short-term interest rates. 
The Company’s quarterly yield on interest earning assets increased to 4.86% as of December 31, 2024 from 4.83% as of September 30, 2024, and 4.69% as of December 31, 2023.
The sustained elevation of short-term interest rates impacted the Company’s cost of funds, primarily resulting from the shift of noninterest-bearing deposits into higher-cost, interest-bearing, and time deposit balances as well as variable rate debt. The Company’s cost of funds decreased to 1.72% during the three months ended December 31, 2024, from 1.86% during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and was stable compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the lower interest expense resulting from decreased borrowings resulted in an increase of the Company’s net interest margin during the three months ended December 31, 2024 to 3.18% from 3.01% during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and from 2.99% for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The Company’s FTE net interest margin increased to 3.20% during the three months ended December 31, 2024, from 3.04% during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and from 3.01% during the three months ended December 31, 2023.
Primary Factors Used in Evaluating Our Business
As a banking institution, we manage and evaluate our financial condition and our results of operations. We monitor and evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statements of income, as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against both our own historical levels as well as the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally.
Results of Operations
Principal tools we use to manage and evaluate the results of our operations include tracking performance through metrics such as return on average equity, return on average assets, efficiency ratio, noninterest expense as a percent of total average assets, earnings per share, credit quality metrics, total shareholder return, net interest income, noninterest income, noninterest expense, and net income. 
Net interest income is affected by a number of factors such as the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates, the speed of changes in interest rates, and changes in the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities, has the most significant impact on net interest income. Other factors like volume of loans, investment securities, and other interest earning assets, compared to the volume of interest-bearing deposits, short-term borrowings, and other indebtedness, also cause changes in our net interest income between periods. Noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and stockholders’ equity, help support earning assets.
 The impact of funding, including noninterest-bearing deposit sources, is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. We evaluate our net interest income by assessing the yields on our loans and other earning assets, the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, and the levels of our net interest spread and net interest margin.
We seek to increase our noninterest income over time, and we evaluate our noninterest income relative to the trends of the individual types of noninterest income in view of changes in the regulatory environment and prevailing market conditions. We manage our noninterest expenses in consideration of growth opportunities and our community banking model that emphasizes client service and responsiveness. We evaluate our noninterest expense on factors that include our noninterest expense relative to our average assets, our efficiency ratio, and the trends of the individual categories of noninterest expense.
38
Table of Contents
Finally, we seek to increase our net income and provide favorable shareholder returns over time, and we evaluate our net income relative to the performance of similar bank holding companies on factors that include return on average assets, return on average equity, total shareholder return, and growth in earnings.
Financial Condition
We manage and evaluate our financial condition by focusing on liquidity, the diversification and quality of our loans, the adequacy of our ACL, the diversification and terms of our deposits, the level of our short-term borrowings and other funding sources, the re-pricing characteristics and maturities of our assets and liabilities, including potential interest rate exposure, and the adequacy of our capital levels. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of cash and investment securities to meet potential payment and funding obligations, and we evaluate our liquidity on factors that include the levels of cash and highly liquid assets relative to our liabilities, the quality and maturities of our investment securities, the ratio of loans held for investment to deposits, and any reliance on brokered certificates of deposit or other wholesale funding sources.
We seek to maintain a diverse and high-quality loan portfolio and evaluate our asset quality on factors that include the allocation of our loans among loan types, credit exposure to any single borrower or industry type, non-performing assets as a percentage of loans held for investment and other real estate owned (“OREO”), and loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. We maintain our ACL based on an estimate of expected credit losses in the loans held for investment portfolio over the life of the loan, including the incorporation of a two-year forecast period at each balance sheet date.
We seek to fund our assets primarily using core client deposits. We evaluate our deposit and funding mix on factors that include the allocation of our deposits among deposit types, the level of our noninterest-bearing deposits, the ratio of our core deposits (i.e. excluding time deposits above $250,000) to our total deposits, and our reliance on brokered deposits or other wholesale funding sources. We seek to manage the mix, maturities, and re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities to mitigate the impact of a changing interest rate environment on our net interest margin, and we evaluate our asset-liability management using models to evaluate the changes to our net interest income under different interest rate scenarios.
Finally, we seek to maintain adequate capital levels to absorb unforeseen operating losses and to help support the growth of our balance sheet. We evaluate our capital adequacy using the regulatory and financial capital ratios including tangible common equity to tangible assets, leverage capital ratio, tier 1 common capital to total risk-weighted assets, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States and follow practices prescribed within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant accounting policies we follow are summarized in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.    
Our critical accounting estimates are summarized below. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires management to make particularly difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or the use of different estimates that management could have reasonably used in the current period, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, results of operations, or liquidity.        
Allowance for Credit Losses
The ACL represents our estimate of credit losses expected over the life of loans at each balance sheet date, which is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Increases in the ACL are recorded through net income as a provision for credit loss expense. Decreases in the ACL are recorded through net income as a reversal of provision for credit loss expense. Loans are charged-off against the ACL when management confirms the uncollectibility of a loan balance. Expected recoveries recorded do not exceed the aggregate of loan amounts previously charged-off. The ACL represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses in the loans held for investment portfolio over the life of the loan, including the incorporation of a two-year forecast period with one-year reversion period for economic conditions.  
We perform a quarterly assessment of the risks inherent in our loan portfolio, as well as a detailed review of each significant loan we have assessed to have weaknesses that does not share common risk characteristics with other loans. Based on this analysis, we record a provision for credit losses in order to maintain the ACL at appropriate levels. In determining the ACL, management estimates the ACL balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
39
Table of Contents
Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental and economic conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant factors. The ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. 
For loans acquired in a business combination with no significant evidence of credit deterioration since origination, the Company estimates an ACL of the acquired loans determined using the same methodology as other loans held for investment. 
A significant judgment in determining the final ACL is the macroeconomic forecast selected from the third-party service provider. The third-party service provider produces multiple economic scenarios that represent baseline, severe, and consensus scenarios. To illustrate the sensitivity of the model to forecast selection, the severe forecast was run resulting in an increase in the ACL of approximately $67.7 million. The severe scenarios includes assumptions such as an economy closer to recession, continuous inflationary pressure, deteriorating labor market, and a deteriorating unemployment market, among others. Conversely, the baseline forecast includes increasing GDP, steady unemployment, and future rate cuts. This sensitivity analysis and related impact on the ACL is a hypothetical analysis and is not intended to represent management's judgments or assumptions of qualitative loss factors that were utilized at December 31, 2024.
The ACL is maintained at an amount we believe to be sufficient to provide for estimated losses expected over the life of the loans at each balance sheet date resulting from management’s assessment of the quantitative and qualitative factors utilized to determine the ACL. Management monitors trends in the loan portfolio, including changes in the levels of past due, internally classified, and non-performing loans. Changes in the estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on our ACL, and as a result, on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations. 
See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of the methodology used to determine the ACL and our policy pertaining to acquired loans. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Loans” for a discussion on the factors driving changes in the amount of the ACL. See also Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Credit Risks.”
Goodwill    
The excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates it is likely impairment has occurred. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. In any given year, the Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value. If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, a quantitative impairment test is performed. In performing a quantitative test for impairment, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on analyses of the Company’s market value, discounted cash flows, and peer values. The determination of goodwill impairment is sensitive to market-based economics and other key assumptions used in determining or allocating fair value. Variability in the market and changes in assumptions or subjective measurements used to estimate fair value are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.  
Our annual goodwill impairment test is performed each year as of July 1. The Company performed its 2024 annual goodwill impairment qualitative assessment and determined the Company’s goodwill was not considered impaired.
For additional information regarding goodwill, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report and “Risk Factors—Operational Risks,” included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide detail about the results of operations by comparing the years ended December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2023. A similar discussion and analysis that compares the fiscal year 2023 to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, may be found in Part II, Item 7, “Results of Operations” of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Net Income 
Net income decreased $31.5 million, or 12.2%, to $226.0 million, or $2.19 per diluted share, in 2024, compared to $257.5 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, in 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in provision for credit losses and due to lower net interest income as a result of higher funding costs, partially offset by higher non-interest income due to the loss on sale of securities in 2023. This was partially offset by lower noninterest expense mainly due to lower FDIC insurance expense related to the special assessment in 2023 and lower other expenses, including credit card rewards.

Common stock dividend payout ratio represents dividends per common share divided by basic earnings per common share.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income, the largest source of our operating income, is derived from interest, dividends, and fees received on interest earning assets, less interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities. Interest earning assets primarily include loans and investment securities. Interest bearing liabilities include deposits, short-term borrowings, and various other forms of indebtedness. Net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates, the speed of changes to interest rates, and changes in the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities, has the most significant impact on net interest income. Other factors like volume of loans, investment securities, and other interest earning assets compared to the volume of interest-bearing deposits, short-term borrowings, and other indebtedness also cause changes in our net interest income between periods. Noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and stockholders’ equity, help to support earning assets.
Net interest income decreased $57.2 million during 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increased interest income on loans as a result of higher loan yields, which was more than offset by higher interest expense on deposits and declines in interest and dividends on investment securities as a result of a decrease in average investment security balances during the comparable periods. 
Net interest income included interest accretion related to the fair value of acquired loans of $24.6 million during 2024 as compared to $20.4 million in 2023, of which $7.2 million was the result of early loan payoffs during 2024, as compared to $2.5 million in 2023. There were 
$
5.5
 million and 
no material recoveries of previously charged-off loan interest in 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Our net interest margin ratio decreased 10 basis points to 3.02% during 2024, as compared to 3.12% in 2023. Our net FTE interest margin ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, decreased 10 basis points to 3.04% during 2024, as compared to 3.14% in 2023. Exclusive of the impact of interest accretion on acquired loans, our 2024 net FTE interest margin ratio decreased 12 basis points over our similarly calculated net interest margin ratio in 2023.
The following table presents, for the periods indicated, condensed average balance sheet information using daily average balances, together with interest income and yields earned on average interest earning assets and interest expense and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities.

Provision for (reduction of) Credit Losses
Fluctuations in the provision for credit losses reflect charge-offs and recoveries as well as management’s estimate of possible credit losses based upon the composition of our loan portfolio, evaluation of the borrowers’ ability to repay, collateral value underlying loans, loan loss trends, and estimated effects of current and forecasted economic conditions on our loans held for investment and investment securities portfolios.
43
Table of Contents
During 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $67.8 million, as compared to a $32.2 million provision for credit losses in 2023. The 2024 provision includes a provision for credit losses of $80.9 million related to loans held for investment, reduction of credit losses of $13.2 million related to unfunded commitments, and a provision for credit losses of $0.1 million related to held-to-maturity securities. The provision incorporated the impact of credit movement during the year, changes in loan balances, the attributes of the current portfolio, asset quality metrics, a review of the current economic outlook, and net charge-offs of $104.5 million, or 0.57% of average loans outstanding, for 2024, primarily consisting of a $49.3 million commercial and industrial loan, a $15.9 million commercial real estate loan, and $13.0 million related to two construction real estate loans, compared to $23.5 million, or 0.13% of average loans outstanding in 2023.

Noninterest income increased $31.1 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Significant components of these fluctuations are discussed below. 
Payment services revenues consist of interchange revenue that merchants pay for processing electronic payment transactions, associated fees earned from the issuance of business credit cards, consumer credit cards, and debit cards, and ATM service fees. Payment services revenues decreased $2.8 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, mainly as result of decreased business credit card volume.
Mortgage banking revenues include origination and processing fees on residential real estate loans held for sale, gains on residential real estate loans sold to third parties, income earned from the servicing of mortgages originated by the Company which are held by third parties, and any impairments to or subsequent recovery of the Company’s mortgage servicing rights valuation. Mortgage banking revenues decreased $1.8 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of the decline in mortgage loan production volume as a result of the higher interest rate environment compared to 2023. 
Wealth management revenues are principally comprised of fees earned for management of trust assets and investment services. Wealth management revenues increased $3.5 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, mainly as a result of an increase in trust services. The Company had $8.1 billion of assets under management at December 31, 2024 compared to $8.0 billion at December 31, 2023.
Service charge fees primarily consist of treasury services and overdraft charges on deposit accounts. These service charges increased $2.7 million in 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in 2024 is mainly driven by increases in ACH, wire, sweep, and healthcare treasury service fees. 
Investment securities losses, net includes realized gains and losses associated with the sales of investment securities. Investment securities losses, net was zero in 2024 compared to $23.5 million in the same period in 2023. The improvement was primarily due to a loss of $23.5 million incurred on the sale of $853.0 million of available-for-sale investment securities in 2023.

Table of Contents
Other income primarily includes company-owned life insurance revenues, check printing income, agency stock dividends, and gains on sales of miscellaneous assets. Other income increased $6.5 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance of $2.0 million, $1.5 million gain on sale of assets, and a decrease of $2.3 million on the disposition of loans compared to the 2023 period.
Noninterest expense
Noninterest expense decreased $19.4 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily a result of a $9.0 million reduction in special FDIC insurance assessment fees and a $21.3 million reduction in other expenses, partially offset by an increase in salaries and wages. Significant components of noninterest expense are discussed below.

Salaries and wages expense primarily consist of salaries, severance, commissions, overtime, bonus accrual, and temporary employee expenses. Salaries and wages expense increased $7.8 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily as a result of higher short-term incentive accruals in 2024, which were partially offset by lower salaries and wages and net severance costs as a result of the reduction in work force in December 2023.
Employee benefits include payroll taxes, medical insurance, long term incentive, and 401K plans.  Employee benefits expense increased $1.1 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher long term incentive accruals in 2024 because of low incentive accruals related to Company performance in 2023, which were partially offset by lower health insurance costs and lower payroll tax costs in 2024. 
Outsourced technology services primarily include technology services related to the core system platform, software as a service, automated teller machines, technology equipment and software maintenance. Outsourced technology services expense decreased $2.8 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower core processing costs in 2024.
Furniture and equipment expense primarily consist of maintenance and repairs, ATM expense, and depreciation.  Furniture and equipment expense decreased $1.4 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in maintenance and repairs in 2024.
     OREO expense, net includes expenses and income, gain or loss on sale, and valuation adjustments on property acquired through foreclosure on defaulted loans. OREO expense, net increased $2.6 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of downward valuation adjustments in 2024 partially offset by a decrease in expenses and gains on sale during the same period.
Professional fee expense is comprised of legal fees, audit and tax fees, consultant fees, and outside services.  Professional fee expense increased $2.5 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily related to an increase in audit fees, along with consulting and investment advisory services.

      The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions and charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the DIF at a specific level. FDIC insurance premiums decreased $7.5 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily attributable to the reduction of $9.0 million in the special assessment accrual recorded in 2024 compared to 2023 to cover the losses incurred by the DIF in response to 2023 bank failures. Under the special assessment, the Bank was assessed 13.4 basis points annually on an assessment base equal to its estimated uninsured deposits, after excluding the first $5 billion of uninsured deposits. The special assessment is being collected on a quarterly basis for eight quarters which began with the first quarter of 2024, although the FDIC retained the flexibility to extend the special assessment period as well as impose a one-time shortfall assessment to collect any remaining amount to fully recover the losses to the DIF. 
Other expenses primarily include advertising and public relations costs; office supply, postage, freight, telephone, and travel expenses; donations expense; debit and credit card expenses; board of director fees; legal expenses; and other operational losses. Other expenses decreased $21.3 million in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily resulting from decreases in donation expense, credit card rewards accruals, reclassifications of new market tax credit amortization expenses to income tax expense as a result of the adoption of ASU 2023-02, fraud losses, travel costs, and continued focus on cost savings initiatives. 
Income Tax Expense
Our effective federal tax rate was 18.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 18.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Fluctuations in effective federal income tax rates are primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income, a decrease in net tax exempt interest income, and an increase in tax credits and the non-deductible portion of FDIC premium expense, which was partially offset by an increase in the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance.
State income tax applies primarily to pretax earnings generated within Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, and South Dakota. Our effective state tax rate was 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Financial Condition
The financial condition discussion below is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report. A similar discussion and analysis comparing fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 may be found in Part II, Item 7, “Financial Condition” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Total Assets
Total assets decreased $1,533.8 million, or 5.0%, to $29,137.4 million as of December 31, 2024, from $30,671.2 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to normal amortization of the investment securities which were used to pay down short-term borrowings and decreases in loans held for investment, which were partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents. Significant fluctuations in balance sheet accounts are discussed below.
Investment Securities
We manage our investment portfolio to obtain the highest yield possible while meeting our risk tolerance and liquidity guidelines and satisfying the pledging requirements for deposits of state and political subdivisions and securities sold under repurchase agreements. Our portfolio principally comprises U.S. treasury notes, U.S. government agency, U.S. government agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government residential mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate securities, and tax-exempt municipal securities. 
Debt securities rated in the highest category by nationally recognized rating agencies and debt securities backed by the U.S. Government and government sponsored agencies, both on a direct and indirect basis, represented approximately 92.9% and 94.5% of the investment portfolio’s AFS and HTM segments, respectively, at December 31, 2024. All other held-to-maturity debt securities rated below AAA, not backed by the U.S. Government or government sponsored agencies, or which are not rated represented approximately 5.5% of total HTM debt securities at December 31, 2024.
 Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in the Bank are additional investments that are classified as cash equivalents rather than as investment securities. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value, while investment securities classified as held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost. Unrealized gains or losses, net of the deferred tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are reported as increases or decreases in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of stockholders’ equity.

Investment securities decreased $1,304.8 million, or 14.4%, to $7,744.6 million as of December 31, 2024, from $9,049.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily resulting from pay-downs and maturities which were primarily used to paydown short-term borrowings, partially offset by a $48.6 million increase in fair market values and purchases of $102.2 million during the period. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Investment Securities” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for additional details.
As of December 31, 2024, the estimated duration of our investment portfolio was 3.7 years, as compared to 3.5 years as of December 31, 2023. The weighted average yield on investment securities increased 1 basis point to 2.92% in 2024, from 2.91% in 2023.
As of December 31, 2024, investment securities with amortized costs and fair values of $3,460.2 million and $3,092.6 million, respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits, derivatives, and securities sold under repurchase agreements, as compared to $3,858.6 million and $3,462.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. For additional information concerning securities sold under repurchase agreements, see “Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements” included herein.
Mortgage-backed securities and, to a limited extent other securities, have uncertain cash flow characteristics that present additional interest rate risk in the form of prepayment or extension risk primarily caused by changes in market interest rates. This additional risk is generally rewarded in the form of higher yields. Maturities of mortgage-backed securities presented below are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our investments in non-agency mortgage-backed securities totaled $218.1 million. All other mortgage-backed securities included in the table below were issued by U.S. government entities and sponsored entities. As of December 31, 2024, there were no significant concentrations of investments (greater than 10% of stockholders’ equity) in any individual security issuer, except for U.S. government or agency-backed securities.
Approximately 74.0% and 74.2% of our tax-exempt securities were general obligation securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which 29.8% and 31.1%, respectively, were issued by political subdivisions or agencies within the states we operate, including Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming.
As of December 31, 2024, we had investment securities with fair values aggregating $6,296.7 million that had been in a continuous loss position more than 12 months. Gross unrealized losses on these securities totaled $746.2 million as of December 31, 2024, and were attributable to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no ACL on available-for-sale securities and an ACL on held-to maturity securities classified as corporate and municipal securities of $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
The following table sets forth the carrying value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the percentage of total investment securities and weighted average yields on investment securities as of December 31, 2024. Weighted-average yields have been computed on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21%.

Real Estate Loans.
 We provide interim construction and permanent financing for both single-family and multi-unit properties, medium-term loans for commercial, agricultural and industrial property and/or buildings and equity lines of credit secured by real estate. 
Commercial real estate loans
.
 Commercial real estate loans include loans for property and improvements used commercially by the borrower or for lease to others for the production of goods or services. Approximately 33.0% and 34.4% of our commercial real estate loans were owner occupied as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Construction loans
.
 Construction loans are primarily to commercial builders for residential lot development and the construction of single-family residences and commercial real estate properties. Construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to pre-approved permanent financing. As of December 31, 2024, our construction loan portfolio was divided among the following categories: approximately $216.9 million, or 17.4%, residential construction; approximately $738.7 million, or 59.4%, commercial construction; and approximately $289.0 million, or 23.2%, land acquisition and development. 
Residential real estate loans
.
  Residential real estate loans are typically secured by first liens on the financed property. Included in residential real estate loans were home equity loans and lines of credit of $557.0 million, or 25.4%, and $541.8 million, or 24.1%, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Agricultural real estate loans
.
  Agricultural real estate loans are secured by farmland or ranchland consisting of short, intermediate, and long-term structures to experienced agriculturalists who have demonstrated management capabilities, established production and historical financial performance. 
Consumer Loans.
 Our consumer loans include direct personal loans; credit card loans and lines of credit; and indirect loans created when we purchase consumer loan contracts advanced for the purchase of automobiles, boats, and other consumer goods from the consumer product dealer network within the market areas we serve. Personal loans and indirect dealer loans are generally secured by automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats, and other types of personal property and are made on an installment basis. In January 2025, we announced our plans to no longer originate indirect loans as of February 28, 2025, as further discussed above (see “—Recent Trends and Developments—Indirect Loans”). Credit cards are offered to clients in our market areas. Lines of credit are generally floating rate loans that are unsecured or secured by personal property. Approximately 77.4% and 77.3% of our consumer loans as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were indirect consumer loans. 
Commercial Loans.
 We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial loans. The loans are typically made to small and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail, and service businesses for working capital needs and business expansions. Commercial loans generally include lines of credit, business credit cards, and loans with maturities of five years or less and outstanding balances tend to be cyclical in nature. The loans are generally made with business operations as the primary source of repayment and are typically collateralized by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, and/or personal guarantees. 
Agricultural Loans.
 Our agricultural loans generally consist of short- and medium-term loans and lines of credit that are primarily used for crops, livestock, equipment, and general operations. Agricultural loans are ordinarily secured by assets such as livestock or equipment and are repaid from the operations of the farm or ranch. Agricultural loans generally have maturities of five years or less, with operating lines for one production season.
The following table presents the contractual maturity distribution and interest rates of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024. The amounts provided below do not reflect scheduled repayment or prepayment assumptions related to the loan portfolio.

Non-Performing Assets
Non-performing assets include non-performing loans and OREO. 
Non-performing loans
. Non-performing loans include non-accrual loans and loans contractually past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest.
Non-accrual loans
. We generally place loans on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due, unless they are well secured and in the process of collection, or if the collection of principal and interest is in doubt. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed from income. Non-accrual loans increased $31.9 million, to $138.3 million, as of December 31, 2024, from $106.4 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase of $17.9 million of real estate loans and $22.0 million of commercial loans, partially offset by a decrease of $9.5 million of agricultural loans. Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and when, in the opinion of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest. As of December 31, 2024 there were approximately $56.9 million of non-accrual loans for which there was no related ACL, as these loans had sufficient collateral securing the loan for repayment.
Loans contractually past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest
. Loans past due 90 days or more accruing interest decreased $1.9 million, or 38.8%, to $3.0 million as of December 31, 2024, from $4.9 million as of December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents
Other Real Estate Owned (OREO)
. OREO consists of real property acquired through foreclosure on the collateral underlying defaulted loans. We record OREO at fair value less estimated selling costs. Any excess of loan carrying value over the fair value of the real estate acquired, is recorded as a charge against the ACL. Estimated losses that result from the ongoing periodic valuation of these properties are charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified. The fair values of OREO properties are estimated using appraisals and management estimates of current market conditions. OREO properties are appraised every 18-24 months unless deterioration in local market conditions indicates the need to obtain new appraisals sooner. 
OREO properties are evaluated by management quarterly to determine if additional write-downs are appropriate or necessary based on current market conditions. Quarterly evaluations include a review of the most recent appraisal of the property. Commercial and agricultural OREO properties are listed with unrelated third party professional real estate agents or brokers local to the areas where the marketed properties are located. Residential properties are typically listed with local realtors, after any redemption period has expired. We rely on these local real estate agents and/or brokers to list the properties on the local multiple listing system, to provide marketing materials and advertisements for the properties, and to conduct open houses. 
OREO decreased to $4.3 million as of December 31, 2024, from $16.5 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily attributable to dispositions. As of December 31, 2024, 1.8% of our OREO balance was related to a 1-4 residential property, 84.2% was related to commercial properties, and 14.0% was related to construction properties.

Collateral-dependent loans
. Collateral-dependent loans rely solely on the operation or sale of the collateral for repayment. In evaluating the overall risk associated with a loan, the Company considers character, overall financial condition and resources, and payment record of the borrower; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and the nature and degree of protection provided by the cash flow and value of any underlying collateral. A loan may become collateral-dependent when foreclosure is probable or the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and its source of repayment becomes inadequate over time. At such time, the Company develops an expectation that repayment will be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. Collateral-dependent loans increased to $97.6 million as of December 31, 2024, from $52.6 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to the movement of an $18.9 million agricultural loan, two commercial loans of $16.8 million, and commercial real estate loans.
Modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty
. Modifications of loans are made in the ordinary course of business and are completed on a case-by-case basis through negotiation with the borrower in connection with the ongoing loan collection processes. Loan modifications are made to provide borrowers payment relief. From time to time, we may modify certain loans to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. In some cases, these modifications may result in new loans. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, or a term extension or a combination thereof, among other things. 
For additional information regarding modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Loans Held For Investment” included in financial statements included Part IV, Item 15 of this report.
Allowance for Credit Losses

The Company performs a quarterly assessment of the appropriateness of its ACL in accordance with GAAP. The ACL is established through a provision for credit losses based on our evaluation of quantitative and qualitative risk factors in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. In determining the ACL, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the expected loss can be identified and reasonably determined over the life of the loans. The balance of the ACL is based on historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature or tenure of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current environmental and economic factors, and the estimated impact of forecasted economic conditions on historical loan loss rates. See the discussion under “Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies — Allowance for Credit Losses” above.

The ACL is increased by provisions charged against earnings and net recoveries of charged-off loans and is reduced by negative provisions credited to earnings and net loan charge-offs. The ACL consists of three elements:

(1)
A specific valuation allowance associated with collateral-dependent and other individually evaluated loans. Specific valuation allowances are determined based on assessment of the fair value of the collateral underlying the loans as determined through independent appraisals, the present value of future cash flows, observable market prices, and any relevant qualitative or environmental factors impacting loans.  
(2)
A collective valuation allowance based on loan loss experience and future expectations for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends. The Company applies open pool methodologies for all portfolio segments. The open pool methodology averages quarterly loss rates by modeling segment, calculated as quarter-to-date net charge off balance divided by the end of period balance. Loss rates are recalculated quarterly with recoveries captured in the quarter a loan was charged off, are averaged across a look back period from 2009 to the current period, and are annualized. Macroeconomic-conditioned historical loss rates are applied to loan-level cash flows. Expected future principal and interest cash flows are calculated using contractual repayment terms and prepayment, utilization, interest rate, and probability of default assumptions. Macroeconomic sensitivity models calculate segment-specific multipliers using third party forecast data. The multipliers condition the annual loss rates over the 2-year forecast period, followed by a 1-year straight-line reversion to the unadjusted historical average loss rates. The unadjusted loss rates then apply for the remaining life of the loan. Estimated losses are totaled and aggregated to the segment level.

A qualitative valuation allowance determined based on asset quality trends, industry concentrations, environmental risks, changes in portfolio composition, and other qualitative risk factors, both internal and external to the Company. Other qualitative factors, including changes in loan and lending policies, collateral quality, underwriting standards and personnel, credit review quality, and model imprecision, are also considered.      
Based on the assessment of the appropriateness of the ACL, the Company records provisions for credit losses to maintain the ACL at appropriate levels.

Loans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value as adjusted for credit risk. For loans with no significant evidence of credit deterioration since origination, the difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance of the loan at the acquisition date is amortized into interest income using the effective interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity. An ACL is recorded for the expected credit losses over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the ACL are recorded through provision expense using the same methodology as other loans held for investment.
For loans acquired in business combinations with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination, the Company determines the fair value of the loans by estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest. An ACL is recognized by estimating the expected credit losses of the purchased asset and recording an adjustment to the acquisition date fair value to establish the initial amortized cost basis of the asset. Differences between the established amortized cost basis, and the unpaid principal balance of the asset, is considered to be a non-credit discount/premium and is accreted/amortized into interest income using the level yield interest method. Subsequent changes to the ACL are recorded through provision expense using the same methodology as other loans held for investment.
Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the ACL when management believes the collectability of the principal is unlikely, or, with respect to consumer installment loans, according to an established delinquency schedule. Generally, loans are charged-off when (1) there has been no material principal reduction within the previous 90 days and there is no pending sale of collateral or other assets, (2) there is no significant or pending event which will result in principal reduction within the upcoming 90 days, (3) it is clear that we will not be able to collect all or a portion of the loan, or (4) foreclosure or repossession actions are pending. Loan charge-offs do not directly correspond with the receipt of independent appraisals or the use of observable market data if the collateral value is determined to be sufficient to repay the principal balance of the loan.
If a collateral-dependent loan is adequately collateralized, a specific valuation ACL is not recorded. As such, significant changes in collateral-dependent and non-performing loans do not necessarily correspond proportionally with changes in the specific valuation component of the ACL. Additionally, the Company expects the timing of charge-offs will vary between quarters and will not necessarily correspond proportionally to changes in the ACL or changes in non-performing or collateral-dependent loans due to timing differences among the initial identification of a collateral-dependent loan, recording of a specific valuation allowance for collateral-dependent loans, and any resulting charge-off of uncollectible principal.
Our ACL on loans was $204.1 million, or 1.14% of loans held for investment as of December 31, 2024, as compared to $227.7 million, or 1.25% of loans held for investment, as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in the percentage from December 31, 2023 is due to a specific reserve of $26.5 million for a commercial and industrial loan that was removed from the calculation in 2024 when the loan was charged down. This decrease was partially offset by credit deterioration that was captured in the 2024 ACL calculation.
Although we have established our ACL in accordance with GAAP in the United States and we believe that the ACL is appropriate to provide for known and expected losses in the portfolio at all times, future provisions will be subject to on-going evaluations of the risks in the loan portfolio. If the economy declines or asset quality deteriorates, material additional provisions could be required. The following table sets forth information regarding our ACL as of the dates and for the periods indicated.

Other Borrowed Funds
Other borrowed funds is composed of variable-rate, overnight and fixed-rate borrowings with remaining contractual tenors of up to one year through the Federal Home Loan Bank, to address short-term funding needs. Other borrowed funds decreased $1,035.5 million, to $1,567.5 million as of December 31, 2024 compared to $2,603.0 million at December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the Company’s pay-off of wholesale borrowings in December 2024.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Capital Resources
Stockholders’ equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, sales and redemptions of common stock, and changes in the unrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on available-for-sale investment securities. Stockholders’ equity increased $76.5 million, or 2.4%, to $3,304.0 million as of December 31, 2024 from $3,227.5 million as of December 31, 2023, due to changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, stock-based compensation expense, and retention of earnings, which are partially offset by stock repurchases of vested restricted shares tendered in lieu of cash for payment of income tax withholding amounts by participants, and cash dividends paid. Regular cash dividends paid to common shareholders during 2024 amounted to approximately $195.9 million.
On January 28, 2025, we declared a quarterly dividend to common stockholders of $0.47 per share, which was paid on February 20, 2025 to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2025. The dividend equates to a 5.8% annual yield based on the $32.53 average closing price of the Company’s common stock as reported on NASDAQ during the fourth quarter of 2024.
On December 14, 2023, the Company completed the repurchase of one million shares of its common stock from the estate of a stockholder at a price of $32.14 per share, or the closing price per share of the common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Stock Market on December 14, 2023, representing an aggregate purchase price of $32.1 million. As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not have a repurchase program in effect. For additional information regarding the repurchases, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Capital Stock and Dividend Restrictions” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.
During 2024, the Company granted 43,514 restricted stock units of its common stock to directors for their annual service on the Company’s Board. The aggregate value of the units issued to directors of $1.2 million is amortized into stock-based compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity over a one-year service-based period.
As a bank holding company, the Company must comply with the capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve, and our subsidiary Bank must comply with the capital requirements established by the FDIC. The current risk-based guidelines applicable to us and our Bank are based on the Basel III framework, as implemented by the federal bank regulators. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had capital levels that, in all cases, exceeded the guidelines to be deemed “well-capitalized.”

Liquidity
 Liquidity measures our ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of clients, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Liquid assets include cash, interest bearing deposits in banks, federal funds sold, available-for-sale investment securities, and maturing or prepaying balances in our held-to-maturity investment and loan portfolios. Liquid liabilities include core deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and borrowings. Other sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market funds through non-core deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, additional borrowings through the Federal Reserve’s discount window, and the issuance of preferred or common securities. 
The primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. In our management’s opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic conditions, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies, and various other governmental regulatory authorities.
In the ordinary course of business, we have entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future payments. Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations, including payment of interest on deposits and debt, extensions of credit to borrowers, capital expenditures, and shareholder dividends. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan and investment portfolios, debt financing, and increases in client deposits. For additional information regarding our operating, investing and financing cash flows, see “Consolidated Financial Statements—Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.
The Company had deposits without a stated maturity of $20,125.1 million and time deposits of $2,658.5 million, due in one year or less in addition to time deposits due in more than one year of $232.0 million as of December 31, 2024. For additional details in regard to the Company’s deposits see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Deposits” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had securities sold under repurchase agreements of $523.9 million due in one year or less as the agreements with our client counterparties mature on the next banking day. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $1,567.5 million of FHLB borrowings due in less than one year, $99.1 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes (the “Notes”) due in more than one year, and available borrowing capacity of $4,371.4 million with the FHLB. The Company has unused federal fund lines of credit with third parties amounting to $235.0 million, subject to funds availability. These lines are subject to cancellation without notice. The Company also has an unused line of credit with the FRB for borrowings up to $1,813.6 million secured by government and agency backed securities and a blanket pledge of agricultural and commercial loans and has an unused $50.0 million revolving line of credit with another third party. For additional information concerning long-term debt, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Long Term Debt and Other Borrowed Funds” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report. 
The Company may elect to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on any early redemption date which is any interest payment date on or after May 15, 2025 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Any early redemption of the Notes will be subject to regulatory approval. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding, May 15, 2025, or earlier redemption date, the Notes bear interest at an initial fixed rate of 5.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. From and including May 15, 2025 to, but excluding, May 15, 2025, or earlier redemption date, the Notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be Three-Month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) (as defined in the First Supplemental Indenture Agreement), plus 518.0 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on August 15, 2025. For more information regarding the Notes, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Long Term Debt and Other Borrowed Funds” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

The Company guarantees the distribution and payment for redemption or liquidation of capital trust preferred securities issued by our wholly owned subsidiary business trusts to the extent of funds held by the trusts. Although the guarantees are not separately recorded, the obligations underlying the guarantees are fully reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as subordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts. The subordinated debentures currently qualify as tier 2 capital under the Federal Reserve capital adequacy guidelines. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had subordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts of $163.1 million due in more than one year. For additional information concerning the subordinated debentures, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Subordinated Debentures Held by Subsidiary Trusts” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.
The Company has future minimum rental commitments, exclusive of maintenance and operating costs, required under operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2024 with $11.5 million due in one year or less and $34.2 million due in more than one year. For additional information concerning leases, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Commitments and Contingencies” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.
The Company is a limited partner in several tax-advantaged limited partnerships that have been formed for the purpose of investing in approved qualified affordable housing, renewable energy, or other renovation or community revitalization projects. As of December 31, 2024, the Company expects to recover its investments through the use of tax credits generated by the investments. The Company's unfunded capital commitments to these investments were $25.2 million and $32.3 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reported within accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. 
The Company has entered into various arrangements not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had unused credit card lines of $884.1 million, commitments to extend credit of $3,076.5 million and standby letters of credit of $73.5 million. Included in the $3,076.5 million in credit commitments outstanding, $632.3 million are related to home equity and home equity lines of credit, $1,505.5 million are related to traditional working capital commercial lines, and $420.9 million are unfunded commitments for current or future construction projects. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. For additional information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.
As a bank holding company, we are a corporation separate and apart from our subsidiary Bank and, therefore, we provide for our own liquidity. Our primary sources of funding include management fees and dividends declared and paid by the Bank and access to capital markets. There are statutory, regulatory, and debt covenant limitations that affect the ability of our Bank to pay dividends to us. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations. For additional information regarding dividend restrictions, see “Financial Condition—Capital Resources and Liquidity” above, “Business—Government Regulation and Supervision—Dividends and Restrictions on Transfers of Funds” included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, and “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks and Regulatory and Compliance Risks” included in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 
Company management continuously monitors our liquidity position and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Our management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources, or operations. In addition, our management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, which if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on us.

Through the Bank’s relationship with the FHLB, the Bank owns $81.3 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through FHLB advances. The Bank’s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Bank places at the FHLB. 
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. Our business and the composition of our balance sheet consists of investments in interest earning assets (principally loans and investment securities) which are primarily funded by interest bearing liabilities (deposits and indebtedness). Such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market interest rates such as the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates, the speed of changes in interest rates, and changes in the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk results when, due to different maturity dates and repricing intervals, interest rate indices for interest earning assets fluctuate adversely relative to interest bearing liabilities, thereby creating a risk of decreased net earnings and cash flow.
Although we characterize some of our interest-sensitive assets as securities available-for-sale, such securities are not purchased with the intent to sell in the near term. Rather, such securities may be sold in response to or in anticipation of changes in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk. We do not have any trading instruments nor do we classify any portion of the investment portfolio as trading. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.
Asset Liability Management
The goal of asset liability management is the prudent control of market risk, liquidity, and capital. Asset liability management is governed by policies, goals, and objectives adopted and reviewed by the Bank’s Board. Development of asset liability management strategies and monitoring of interest rate risk are the responsibility of the Asset Liability Committee, or ALCO, which is composed of members of senior management.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk of loss of future earnings or long-term value due to changes in interest rates. Our primary source of earnings is net interest income, which is affected by the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates, the speed of changes in interest rates, the relationship between rates on interest-bearing assets and liabilities, the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments, and the mix of interest-bearing assets and liabilities.
The ability to optimize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of an interest rate spread that can be managed during periods of fluctuating interest rates. Interest sensitivity is a measure of the extent to which net interest income will be affected by market interest rates over a period of time.
Net Interest Income Sensitivity
We believe net interest income sensitivity provides the best perspective of how day-to-day decisions affect our interest rate risk profile. We monitor net interest income sensitivity by utilizing an income simulation model to subject 12- and 24- month net interest income to various rate movements. Simulations modeled quarterly include scenarios where market rates change instantaneously up or down in a parallel or non-parallel manner. Estimates produced by our income simulation model are based on numerous assumptions including, but not limited to: (1) the timing of changes in interest rates, (2) shifts or rotations in the yield curve, (3) repricing characteristics for market rate sensitive instruments, (4) differing sensitivities of financial instruments due to differing underlying rate indices, (5) varying loan prepayment speeds for different interest rate scenarios, (6) the effect of interest rate limitations in our assets, such as caps and floors, and (7) overall growth and repayment rates and product mix of assets and liabilities. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results, but rather to provide insight into our current interest rate exposure and execute appropriate asset/liability management strategies accordingly.
The following table presents the net interest income simulation model’s projected change in net interest income over a one-year horizon due to a change in interest rates. The net interest income simulation assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve and a static balance sheet. The net interest income simulation also uses a deposit beta modeling assumption which is an estimate of the change in interest-bearing deposit pricing for a given change in market interest rates. The deposit beta assumption is derived from empirical analysis and may vary over time depending on the composition of deposit balances. Based on the December 31, 2024 deposit balance composition, the deposit beta assumption is 31% for up- and down- rate scenarios. Actual changes to deposit pricing may vary significantly from this assumption due to management actions, customer behavior, and market forces, which may have significant impacts to our net interest income. The net interest income simulations at December 31, 2024 project that interest-bearing liabilities reprice faster than our interest earning assets.

The preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results. 
As part of the Company’s overall asset and liability management strategy, the Company previously entered into two interest rate collars related to variable-rate loans that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of $300.0 million and entered into four swaps, two of which were related to variable-rate loans and two that were related to variable-rate securities that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of $850.0 million. The collars designated as cash flow hedges synthetically fix the interest income received by the Company when the interest index falls below a floor rate on a rate reset and when the interest index exceeds the cap rate on a rate reset. Each of the swaps designated as cash flow hedges synthetically fixes the interest income received by the Company. 
During 2024, the Company voluntarily terminated three swaps, two of which were related to variable-rate loans and one related to variable-rate securities that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of $550.0 million. The termination of the cash flow hedges resulted in a net loss of $0.2 million being captured in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, and reclassified to interest income over the period the forecasted transactions affect earnings. The active two interest rate collars and one remaining swap designated as cash flow hedges were effective with a total notional amount of $600.0 million.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (who is our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (who is our principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of December 31, 2024. The term "disclosure controls and procedures" means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods required by the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with proper authorizations; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
All internal control over financial reporting processes and systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even processes and systems deemed to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the criteria and guidelines established in the 
Internal Control--Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such assessment, management determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Ernst & Young LLP’s report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 is presented below this management report in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of First Interstate BancSystem, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2024 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes, and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of First Interstate BancSystem, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of First Interstate BancSystem Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)
Description of the Matter
At December 31, 2024, the Company’s loans held for investment portfolio was $
17,844.9
 million with an associated ACL of $
204.1
 million. The provision for credit losses was $
67.8
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the ACL is an estimate and consists of three elements: a specific valuation allowance associated with collateral-dependent and other individually evaluated loans; a collective valuation allowance for loans with similar characteristics and trends; and a qualitative valuation allowance to adjust historical loss information based on an evaluation of qualitative factors. 
The collective valuation allowance is calculated based on the expected future principal and interest cash flows over the remaining life of a loan, adjusted for prepayment and annual loss rate assumptions. Management’s calculation includes segment-specific multipliers that adjust the annual loss rates to the level expected under economic conditions over a two-year forecast period, followed by a one-year, straight-line reversion to the unadjusted, historical average loss rates.
65
Table of Contents
The qualitative valuation allowance represents adjustments to historical loss information and segment-specific multipliers based on asset quality trends, industry concentrations, environmental risks, changes in portfolio composition, and other qualitative risk factors. Other qualitative factors, including changes in loan and lending policies, collateral quality, underwriting standards and personnel, credit review quality, and model imprecision, are also considered. Judgment was required by management to determine the changes in portfolio composition and model imprecision adjustments, which are both part of the qualitative factors management considers.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the ACL process, which include, among others, management’s review and approval controls designed to assess the need for and level of the qualitative adjustments for changes in portfolio composition and model imprecision, which are part of the qualitative factors, and the controls related to the reliability of the data utilized to support management’s assessment. 
To test the qualitative factors for changes in portfolio composition and model imprecision, we evaluated the appropriateness of management’s methodology and assessed the reasonableness of the adjustments and whether all relevant risks were reflected in the ACL. Additionally, with respect to the model imprecision adjustment, with the support of specialists, we evaluated the model methodology and factors that could impact the accuracy of the model results. 
Regarding the measurement of the qualitative factors for changes in portfolio composition and model imprecision, we evaluated the completeness, accuracy and relevance of the underlying internal and external data utilized in management’s estimate and considered the existence of additional or contrary information. We also evaluated the mathematical accuracy of the calculation of qualitative factors. 
We evaluated the overall ACL, inclusive of the qualitative factors, and whether the amount appropriately reflects a reasonable estimate of expected credit losses by comparing the overall ACL to historical losses and ACL reserves established by peer banking institutions.

FIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) 
(1)
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business
. First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. (the “Parent Company” and collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is a financial and bank holding company that, through the branch offices of its bank subsidiary, provides a comprehensive range of banking products and services to individuals, businesses, municipalities, and other entities throughout Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming. In addition to its primary emphasis on commercial and consumer banking services, the Company also offers trust, employee benefit, investment, and insurance services through its bank subsidiary. The Company is subject to competition from other financial institutions and nonbank financial companies, and is also subject to the regulations of various government agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities.
Basis of Presentation
. The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company and its operating subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
one
 significant subsidiary, First Interstate Bank (“FIB”). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications, none of which were material, have been made in the consolidated financial statements for 2023 and 2022 to conform to the 2024 presentation. These reclassifications did not change previously reported net income, financial condition, cash flows, or stockholders’ equity.
Business Combinations.
 The Company accounts for all business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, acquired assets and assumed liabilities are included with the acquirer's accounts as of the date of acquisition, with any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired recognized as either finite lived intangibles or capitalized as goodwill. In addition, acquisition related costs and restructuring costs are recognized as period expenses as incurred. Fair values are subject to refinement over the measurement period, not to exceed one year after the closing date.

Equity Method Investments.
 The Company has investments in real estate joint ventures that are not consolidated because the Company does not own a majority voting interest, control the operations, or receive a majority of the losses or earnings of the joint venture. These joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereby the Company initially records its investment at cost (or fair value at the date of acquisition) and then subsequently adjusts the carrying value for the Company’s proportionate share of distributions and earnings or losses of the joint ventures.
Variable Interest Entities.
 The Company’s wholly owned business trusts, FI Statutory Trust I (“Trust I”), FI Capital Trust II (“Trust II”), FI Statutory Trust III (“Trust III”), FI Capital Trust IV (“Trust IV”), FI Statutory Trust V (“Trust V”), FI Statutory Trust VI (“Trust VI”), Northwest Bancorporation Capital Trust I (“Trust VII”), GWB Capital Trust VI (“Trust VIII”), Sunstate Bancshares Trust II (Trust IX”), Great Western Statutory Trust IV (“Trust X”), HF Financial Capital Trust III (“Trust XI”), HF Trust IV (“Trust XII”), HF Trust V (“Trust XIII”), and HF Trust VI (“Trust XIV”) are variable interest entities for which the Company is not a primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the accounts of Trust I through Trust XIV are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are instead accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The Company has equity investments in variable interest Certified Development Entities (“CDEs”) which have received allocations under the New Markets Tax Credits Program. The underlying activities of the CDEs are community development projects designed primarily to promote community welfare, such as economic rehabilitation and development of low-income areas by providing housing, services, or jobs for residents. The maximum exposure to loss in the CDEs is the amount of equity invested and credit extended by the Company. The Company has credit protection in the form of indemnification agreements, guarantees, and collateral arrangements.  
The Company is required to consolidate VIEs in New Market Tax Credit CDEs in which it has concluded it has a controlling financial interest. At December 31, 2024, approximately $
28.4
 million of the Company’s assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets were related to New Market Tax Credit VIEs which the Company has consolidated. These amounts were $
20.9
 million at December 31, 2023.

FIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) 
Assets Held in Fiduciary or Agency Capacity.
 The Company holds certain trust assets in a fiduciary or agency capacity. The Company also purchases and sells federal funds as an agent. These and other assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not assets of the Company and, accordingly, are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates.
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimate impacting the Company’s consolidated financial statements is the ACL.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
. For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, federal funds sold for less than three-month periods, and interest-bearing deposits in banks with original maturities of less than three months. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had cash of $
518.2
 million and $
199.0
 million, respectively, on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). On March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective March 26, 2020. This action eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions.
Debt Security Investments. 
Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost. Investments in debt securities that may be sold in response to or in anticipation of changes in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk, or other factors, are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value. The unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported, net of applicable income taxes, as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase.
The amortized cost of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale is adjusted for accretion of discounts to maturity and amortization of premiums over the estimated average life of the security, without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are anticipated, or in the case of callable securities, through the first call date, using the effective yield method. Such amortization and accretion is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date in investment securities gains and losses and determined using the specific identification method. 
Accrued interest receivable on investment securities totaled $
29.6
 million and $
38.5
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was reported in the accrued interest receivable line item on the consolidated balance sheets.

Allowance for Credit Losses - Held-to-Maturity Securities:
 Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
Management classifies the held-to-maturity portfolio into the following major security types:
U.S. Treasury notes.
 U.S. Treasury notes issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury are guaranteed by the U.S. government with very little risk to default.
State, county, and municipal securities.
 Municipal bonds issued by municipal governments within the U.S. These types of securities are primarily composed of general obligation bonds, or municipal bonds backed by the credit and taxing power of the issuing jurisdiction and revenue obligation bonds, or municipal bonds that are financed by income-producing projects and are secured by a specified source of revenue. Municipal issues shall have at least a “BBB” rating by Moody's and/or Standard and Poor’s, or equivalent creditworthiness must be established prior to purchase. All non-rated or private placement securities must be analyzed and approved by the Company’s Credit Department and documented prior to purchase.
Obligations of U.S. government agencies and entities.
 Securities held by the Company are primarily issued by The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac, and The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, which are implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government with very little risk of default.

Table of Contents
FIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) 
U.S. agency commercial mortgage-backed securities.

Commercial mortgage-backed securities held by the Company are primarily issued by U.S. government agencies and entities. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government with very little risk of default. 
U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities.

Residential mortgage-backed securities held by the Company are primarily issued by U.S. government agencies and entities. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government with very little risk of default. 
U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations.

Collateralized mortgage obligations include agency residential securities which either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government with very little risk of default.
Corporate securities.
 Securities held by the Company are primarily comprised of corporate bonds (both senior and subordinated-debt) issued by a firm or public entity which carry ratings no lower than investment grade “BBB” or better by Moody’, Standard and Poor’s, or Kroll rating agencies. All corporate subordinated-debt securities are analyzed and approved by the Company prior to purchase. 
Allowance for Credit Losses - Available-For-Sale Securities:
 For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For available-for-sale debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company performs a qualitative assessment as to whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an ACL is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income.
Changes in the ACL are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the ACL when management believes the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.

Loans Held for Sale.
 The Company originates certain loans intended for sale in the secondary market. Conforming agency mortgage production is sold on a servicing retained basis. Certain loans, such as government guaranteed mortgage loans, are sold on a servicing released basis. The Company has elected the fair value option for residential mortgage loans the Company originated with the intent to sell that are classified as loans held for sale and are recorded at fair value, determined individually, as of the balance sheet date. The loan’s fair value includes the servicing value of the loans as well as any accrued interest. The fair value of loans held for sale are primarily determined based on quoted prices for similar loans in active markets or outstanding commitments from third-party investors. 
Performing residential real estate loans that are held for sale are generally sold with servicing rights retained. Upon the sale of an originated loan, the mortgage servicing right is recorded at its estimated fair value.
Loans that are originated and classified as held for investment are periodically sold in order to manage liquidity, asset credit quality, interest rate risk, or concentration risk. Loans that are reclassified into loans held for sale from loans held for investment, due to a change in intent, are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. Any changes in fair value attributable to credit deterioration at the time of transfer are charged against the ACL. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance and any net gains and losses are recorded as a component of noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations.

Loans Held for Investment.

Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at amortized cost or principal balance outstanding. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts and deferred loan fees and costs. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments.

Accrued interest receivable on loans held for investment totaled $
84.8
 million and $
86.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was reported in the accrued interest receivable line item on the consolidated balance sheets. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance of underlying loans. Interest income on mortgage and commercial loans is discontinued and placed on nonaccrual status at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the loan is well secured and in process of collection.
Mortgage loans that are 180 days past due and commercial loans are charged off to the extent principal or interest is deemed uncollectible. Consumer and credit card loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off no later than 120 days past due unless the loan is in the process of collection. Past-due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. The Company considers a loan to be past due when it is 30 days or more past its contractual payment due date. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful.
All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans reduces the principal balances and interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero or the loan qualifies for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and when, in the opinion of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest.

Purchased Credit Deteriorated (“PCD”) Loans 
The Company has loans acquired through acquisitions, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Loans that meet at least one of the following criteria are considered to have experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination at the date of acquisition: 1) have experienced more than one delinquency of more than 60 days or 60+ days past due as of the acquisition date; 2) have been placed on nonaccrual status at any point since origination; 3) are special mention, substandard, doubtful as of the acquisition date; 4) have experienced a modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty as of the acquisition date; or 5) are in high-risk industries based on macroeconomic conditions and local market conditions of the acquired entity on the acquisition date. PCD loans are recorded at the amount paid for the loan. An ACL is determined using the same methodology as other loans held for investment. The initial ACL determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan’s purchase price and ACL becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the ACL are recorded through provision expense.

Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans held for investment
The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected over the life of the loans. Loans are charged off against the ACL when management determines that a loan balance cannot be collected. The Company applies recoveries when received and has elected not to forecast recoveries for purposes of calculating the ACL.
The ACL estimate consists of three elements: a specific valuation allowance associated with collateral-dependent and other individually evaluated loans; a collective valuation allowance for loans with similar characteristics and trends; and a qualitative valuation allowance to adjust historical loss information based on an evaluation of qualitative factors.
The specific valuation allowance is determined based on an assessment of the fair value of the collateral underlying the loans as determined through independent appraisals, the present value of future cash flows, observable market prices, and any relevant qualitative or environmental factors impacting loans.  
The collective valuation allowance is estimated using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. 
The qualitative valuation allowance represents adjustments to historical loss information and segment-specific multipliers based on asset quality trends, industry concentrations, environmental risks, changes in portfolio composition, and other qualitative risk factors, both internal and external to the Company. Other qualitative factors, including changes in loan and lending policies, collateral quality, underwriting standards and personnel, credit review quality, and model imprecision, are also considered.

Annualized loss rates are recalculated quarterly, with subsequent recoveries captured in the quarter a loan was charged off and are averaged across a look back period from 2009 to the current period. Expected future principal and interest cash flows are calculated using contractual terms while considering prepayment, utilization, and annual loss rate assumptions. Macroeconomic models calculate segment-specific multipliers using third party forecast data. The multipliers adjust the annual loss rates to the level expected under the economic conditions over the 2-year forecast period, followed by a 1-year straight-line reversion to the unadjusted historical average loss rates. The unadjusted loss rates then apply for the remaining life of the loan. Estimated losses are totaled and aggregated to the portfolio segment level.
Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments, defaults, interest rates, and utilization rates. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that a modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty will be executed or the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.
A loan for which the terms have been modified and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, is considered to be a modification to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The ACL on a loan to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is measured using the same method as all other loans held for investment, except when the loan is individually assessed for credit loss.
The Company segments the loan portfolio into pools based on the following risk characteristics: financial asset type, collateral type, loan structure, and credit characteristics.
The Company has identified the following portfolio segments:
Real Estate loans.
 Include commercial real estate loans which are non-farm, non-residential real estate loans generally secured by first liens on income-producing real estate and generally mature in less than 10 years; construction development loans which are primarily to commercial builders for residential lot development and the construction of single-family residences and commercial real estate properties; commercial construction loans which are primarily made to commercial builders for the development of commercial real estate properties; and construction and development loans which are generally underwritten pursuant to credit worthiness or pre-qualification for permanent financing. During the construction phase for any of the above loans, the borrower pays interest only. In most cases, construction and development loans generally transition to permanent real estate loans or otherwise mature in three years or less. 
Real estate loans also include agricultural real estate loans that generally mature in ten years or less, secured by farmland or ranchland. These loans fund the construction of short, intermediate, and long-term structures and are made to experienced agriculturalists who have demonstrated management capabilities, established production and historical financial performance. Real estate loans also include consumer home equity and home equity lines of credit (“HELOC”) that are secured by residential property and generally mature in 25 years or less, and residential loans which are loans to finance the purchase or refinance of residential property which are typically secured by first liens or are construction loans to commercial builders or owner occupants for the construction of single-family residences. Residential 1-4 family loans generally mature within 15 years, although in some instances, they could mature in up to 30 years. Construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to credit worthiness or pre-qualification for permanent financing. During the construction phase, the borrower pays interest only. Residential construction loans generally transition to a permanent residential loan or otherwise mature in two years or less. 
Consumer loans.
 Include indirect, direct advance lines, and credit cards. Indirect are loan contracts advanced for the purchase of automobiles, boats, and other consumer goods from the consumer product dealer networks within our market areas. Indirect dealer loans are generally secured by automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats, and other types of personal property and are made on an installment basis. Consumer indirect line loans generally mature in seven years or less. Consumer direct and advance line loans are originated for a variety of purposes including the purchase of automobiles, boats and other consumer goods, home improvements, medical expenses, vehicle repairs, debt consolidation, and planned expenses in addition to the purchase of automobiles, boats, and other consumer goods. Consumer direct and advance line loans generally mature in seven years or less. Consumer credit card loans are lines of credit offered to clients in our market areas that are generally floating rate loans and include both unsecured and secured lines. Consumer credit card loans generally do not have stated maturities but are reviewed periodically and are unconditionally cancellable.

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) 
Commercial loans.
 Include commercial and industrial loans through a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial loans, including loans to finance showroom floor inventories and other loans for commercial purposes that are secured by 1-4 family residential property. These loans are typically made to small and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail, and service businesses for working capital needs and business expansions. Floor plan loans and commercial purpose loans secured by 1-4 family residential property generally mature in seven years or less. Commercial loans also include secured and unsecured lines of credit, business credit cards, and loans with maturities of five years or less. Outstanding balances on these commercial loans tend to be cyclical in nature. These loans are generally made with business operations as the primary source of repayment, and are typically collateralized by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, and/or personal guarantees.  
Agricultural loans.
 Agricultural loans generally consist of short and medium-term loans and lines of credit that are primarily used for crops, livestock, equipment, and general operations. Agricultural loans are ordinarily secured by assets such as livestock or equipment and are repaid from the operations of the farm or ranch. Agricultural loans generally have maturities of seven years or less, with operating lines for one production season.  
Allowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures.
 The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. Management considers unused credit card lines and federal fund lines, extended to others, to be unconditionally cancellable. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted through the provision for credit losses. The estimate considers the likelihood that funding will occur and includes expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the estimated life. 
The Company has identified commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit determined not to be unconditionally cancellable as categories with off-balance sheet credit exposures and uses the commitment balance, expected loss rate, expected cash flows, and utilization rate as primary assumptions to develop the ACL on those exposures. The utilization rate represents management’s best estimate of the probability that the unfunded portion of the commitment will be funded given existing economic conditions.

Goodwill
. The excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely impairment has occurred. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. In any given year the Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value. If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, a quantitative impairment test is performed. In performing a quantitative test for impairment, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on analyses of the Company’s market value, discounted cash flows and peer values. 
Core Deposit and Other Customer Relationship Intangibles.
 Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles and other customer relationship intangibles. Core deposit intangibles represent the intangible value of depositor relationships resulting from deposit liabilities assumed, as a result of acquisitions, and are amortized using an accelerated method based on the estimated weighted average useful lives of the related deposits, which is generally ten years. Other customer relationship intangibles represent the value of the identifiable intangible value assigned to customer relationships arising from acquired companies and are amortized within other intangibles amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life, which is 12 years.
Mortgage Servicing Rights
. The Company recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans for others, whether acquired or internally originated. Mortgage servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value based on comparable market data and are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income within mortgage banking revenues in the consolidated statements of income. Mortgage servicing rights are evaluated quarterly for impairment by comparing carrying value of mortgage servicing rights to the discounted expected future cash flows, taking into consideration the estimated level of prepayments based on current industry expectations and the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans including loan type, note rate, and loan term. Impairment adjustments, if any, are recorded through a valuation allowance to other income in the consolidated statements of income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) 
Premises and Equipment
. Buildings, furniture, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense recorded within occupancy, net on the consolidated statements of income is computed using straight-line methods over estimated useful lives of 
5
 to 
45
 years for buildings and improvements and 
3
 to 
15
 years for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under a financing lease are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases. Land is recorded at cost. Costs incurred for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
We have leased branches and office space and have entered into various other agreements in conducting our business. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included within the premises and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation line item and our operating lease liability is included within the accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized within occupancy, net on the consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, subject to any changes in the lease or expectations regarding the terms. Variable lease costs such as property taxes are expensed as incurred. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately as the amounts are readily determinable under our lease contracts. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. 
In recognizing lease right-of use assets and related lease liabilities, we determine whether an agreement represents a lease and at commencement of the lease we evaluate each agreement to determine whether the lease is an operating or financing lease. Some of our lease agreements have contained renewal options, tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, and rent escalation clauses. Right-of-use lease assets represent our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and the lease obligation represents our commitment to make the lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use lease assets and obligations are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For the Company’s leases that do not provide an implicit rate, we use an estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The right-of-use lease asset includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and excludes any lease incentives. The estimated lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.

Company-Owned Life Insurance
. Key executive and group life insurance policies are recorded at their cash surrender value. Separate account group life insurance policies are subject to a stable value contract that offsets the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the market value of the policies and are recorded at the stabilized investment value. Changes in the cash surrender or stabilized investment value of insurance policies, as well as insurance proceeds received, are recorded as other income within the consolidated statements of income, and are not subject to income taxes.
Deferred Compensation Plan.
 The Company has a deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain highly compensated officers and directors of the Company. The plan allows for discretionary employer contributions in excess of tax limits applicable to the Company’s 401(k) plan and the deferral of salary, short-term incentives, or director fees subject to certain limitations. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities are included in other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred compensation plan assets were $
22.7
 million and $
19.2
 million, respectively. Corresponding deferred compensation plan liabilities were $
22.7
 million and $
19.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.
 Long-lived assets, including premises and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is based on the asset’s fair value. 
No
 impairment losses were recognized in 2024, 2023, or 2022.

OREO
. Real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans is initially carried at current fair value less estimated selling costs. Any excess of loan carrying value over the fair value of the real estate acquired is recorded as a charge to the ACL. Subsequent adjustments are based on the lower of cost or fair value (less estimated selling costs) and are included in OREO expense on the consolidated statements of income. Subsequent increases in fair value less estimated selling costs are recorded as a reduction in OREO expense to the extent of recognized losses. Operating expenses, net of related income, and gains or losses on sales are included in OREO expense on the consolidated statements of income.

Restricted Equity Securities.
 The Company, as a member of the FRB and the FHLB, is required to maintain investments in each of the organization’s capital stock. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, restricted equity securities of the FRB of $
95.0
 million and $
94.2
 million, respectively, and restricted equity securities of the FHLB of $
81.3
 million and $
127.8
 million, respectively, in addition to other equity securities of $
1.2
 million for both years, were included in the consolidated balance sheets caption FHLB and FRB stock, at cost. No ready market exists for the FHLB and FRB restricted equity securities, and they have no quoted market values. Restricted equity securities are periodically reviewed for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. 
The determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recovery of par value is influenced by the significance of the decline compared to the cost basis of the restricted equity securities, length of time a decline has persisted, impact of legislative and regulatory changes on the issuing organizations, and the liquidity positions of the issuing organizations. Based on management’s assessment, no impairment losses were recorded on restricted equity securities during 2024, 2023, or 2022.
Derivatives and Hedging Activities. 
For asset and liability management purposes, the Company enters into interest rate swap contracts to hedge against changes in forecasted cash flows or changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to interest rate exposures. Interest rate swaps are contracts in which a series of interest payments are exchanged over a prescribed period. The notional amount upon which the interest payments are based is not exchanged. 
The Company formally assesses, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. For derivatives that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into interest income in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 
When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (a) it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows or fair value of a hedged item (including forecasted transactions); (b) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (c) the derivative is de-designated as a hedge instrument, because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur; or (d) management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate.
When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in earnings. In all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative will be carried at its fair value on the balance sheet, with subsequent changes in its fair value recognized in current-period earnings.
 The Company enters into certain interest rate swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into interest rate lock commitments to finance residential mortgage loans that are not designated as accounting hedges. These commitments, which contain fixed expiration dates, offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by the Company. Interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor. Loan commitments related to residential mortgage loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives and are marked to market through earnings. In addition to the effects of the change in market interest rate, the fair value measurement of the derivative also contemplates the expected cash flows to be received from the counterparty from the future sale of the loan. 
The Company also sells residential mortgage loans on either a best efforts or mandatory delivery basis and mitigates the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing interest rate lock commitments by entering into forward loan sales contracts. 
The Company has elected to present the derivatives on a gross basis. For more information regarding our derivatives, see “Derivatives and Hedging Activities” footnote included herein.

Software.
 Capitalized software, stated at cost less accumulated amortization, includes purchased software, capitalizable application development costs associated with internally developed software, and cloud computing arrangements, including capitalizable implementation costs associated with hosting arrangements that are service contracts. Capitalized software is included in premises and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense, generally computed on the straight-line method, is charged to furniture and equipment expense in the consolidated statements of income over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three to five years, or the term of the hosting arrangement for implementation costs related to service contracts. Cloud computing arrangements include software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and other similar hosting arrangements. The Company primarily utilizes SaaS and PaaS arrangements. Capitalized implementation costs of hosting arrangements that are service contracts were $
2.2
 million and $
2.3
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Earnings Per Common Share
. Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding outstanding participating securities. Participating securities include non-vested performance restricted stock awards granted and all non-vested time restricted stock awards. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding determined for the basic earnings per share calculation plus the dilutive effect of stock compensation using the treasury stock method.
Income Taxes
. The Parent Company and its subsidiaries have elected to be included in a consolidated federal income tax return. For state income tax purposes, the combined taxable income of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries is apportioned among the states in which operations take place. Federal and state income taxes attributable to the subsidiaries, computed on a separate return basis, are paid to or received from the Parent Company. 
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on enacted income tax rates which will be in effect when the differences between the financial statement carrying values and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to be reported in taxable income. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Positions taken in the Company’s tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. Uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The Company provides for interest and, in some cases, penalties on tax positions that may be challenged by the taxing authorities. Interest expense is recognized beginning in the first period that such interest would begin accruing. Penalties are recognized in the period that the Company claims the position in the tax return. Interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties are classified within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state examinations by tax authorities for years before 2021. The Company had 
no
 material penalties as of December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.
Revenue Recognition. 
The Company recognizes revenue as it is earned based on contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as services are provided and collectability is reasonably assured. The principal source of revenue is interest income from loans and investments. The Company also earns noninterest income from various banking and financial services offered to its clients. Certain specific policies related to noninterest income include the following:

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) 
Wealth management and trust fee income

Wealth management and trust fee income included within wealth management revenues within the consolidated statements of income represents monthly or other periodic fees due from wealth management clients as consideration for managing the clients’ assets. Wealth management and trust services include custody of assets, investment management, fees for trust services and similar fiduciary activities. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligation is completed. The Company does not earn performance-based incentives. Optional services such as estate settlement and other court appointed services are available to existing trust and asset management clients. The Company’s performance obligation for these transactional-based services is generally satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time.
Service charges on deposit accounts
Service charges on deposit accounts represent general service fees for account maintenance and activity- or transaction-based fees and consist of transaction-based revenue, time-based revenue (service period), item-based revenue or some other individual attribute-based revenue. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligation is completed for account maintenance services or when a transaction has been completed (such as a wire transfer or check orders). Payment for such performance obligations are generally received at a point in time when the performance obligations are satisfied.
Interchange and other fees
Payment services revenue includes interchange and other fees earned whenever the Company’s debit and credit cards are processed through card payment networks such as MasterCard. ATM fees are primarily generated when a Company cardholder uses a non-Company ATM or a non-Company cardholder uses a Company ATM. Merchant services income primarily represents fees charged to merchants to process their debit and credit card transactions, in addition to account management fees. Swap fee income primarily represents income associated with the execution of dealer bank swap agreements. Other service charges include revenue from processing wire transfers, bill pay service, cashier’s checks, and other services. The Company’s performance obligation for interchange and other service charges are largely satisfied, and related revenue recognized, when completion of the services is rendered at a point in time.
Annuity and insurance commissions
Annuity and insurance commissions, included in wealth management revenues, primarily represent commissions received on annuity and insurance product sales. The Company acts as an intermediary between the Company’s client and the insurance carrier. The Company’s performance obligation is generally satisfied upon the issuance of the annuity or insurance policy, the carrier then remits the commission payment to the Company, and the Company recognizes the revenue at a point in time.
Comprehensive Income (Loss).
 Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income, as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with shareholders. In addition to net income, the Company’s comprehensive income (loss) includes the after tax effect of changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities and derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, and changes in the unamortized gain or loss on available-for-sale investment securities transferred to held-to-maturity.
Segment Reporting.
 An operating segment is defined as a component of a business for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 “
Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvement to Reportable Segment Disclosures”
 on January 1, 2024. The “Segment Reporting” topic of the FASB ASC requires that public companies report certain information about operating segments. It also requires that public companies report certain information about their products and services, the geographic areas in which they operate, and their major clients. The Company has identified 
one
 reporting unit and one operating segment, community banking, which encompasses commercial and consumer banking services to serve a similar base of clients utilizing company-wide offerings of similar products and services managed through similar processes and platforms offered to individuals, businesses, municipalities and other entities. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer who is charged with management of the Company and is responsible for the evaluation of operating performance and decision making about the allocation of resources to operating segments.

Table of Contents
FIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) 
The CODM regularly assesses performance of the single operating and reporting segment and decides how to allocate resources based on net income calculated on the same basis as is net income reported in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. The CODM is also regularly provided with expense information at a level consistent with that disclosed in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.
Our principal expenses include: (i) interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings; (ii) salaries and employee benefits; (iii) information technology and communication costs primarily associated with maintaining loan and deposit functions; (iv) furniture, equipment, and occupancy expenses for maintaining our facilities; (v) professional fees, including FDIC insurance assessments; (vi) income tax expense; (vii) provisions for credit losses; (viii) intangible amortization; (ix) other real estate owned expenses; and (x) other segment expenses including legal expenses, advertising and promotion, credit card rewards expense, fees associated with originating and closing loans, insurance, and other expenses necessary to support our employees and service our clients. See the consolidated financial statements for other financial information regarding the Company’s operating segment.

Advertising Costs.
 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred within other expenses. Advertising expense was $
0.7
 million, $
0.9
 million, and $
3.8
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Transfers of Financial Assets.
 Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the assets have been isolated from the Company; the transferee obtains the right, free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right, to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.
Stock-Based Compensation
. Compensation cost for all stock-based awards is measured at fair value on the date of grant and is recognized over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. The impact of forfeitures of stock-based payment awards on compensation expense is recognized as forfeitures occur. Stock-based compensation expense of $
11.8
 million, $
4.7
 million, and $
9.6
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, is included in employee benefits expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.

Fair Value Measurements.
 In general, fair value measurements are based upon quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value measurements are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and require some degree of judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments and other factors. The use of different assumptions or estimation techniques may have a significant effect on the fair value amounts reported.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES 
Goodwill
The Company has goodwill with a carrying value of $
1,100.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and performed its annual impairment assessment as of July 1, 2024 and 2023 concluding there was 
no

The Company determines the ACL on both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities by a discounted cash flow approach when needed, using each security’s effective interest rate at the time of purchase or upon acquisition. The ACL is measured as the amount by which an investment security’s amortized cost exceeds the net present value of expected future cash flows. However, the amount of credit losses for available-for-sale investment securities is limited to the amount of a security’s unrealized loss. The ACL on held-to-maturity investment securities is representative of current expected credit losses that management expects to be incurred over the life of the investment and established through a charge to provision for credit losses in current period earnings. For held-to-maturity investment securities, the Company has the intent and ability to hold these investment securities to maturity.
The investment securities portfolio primarily contains securities that are guaranteed by a sovereign entity or are generally considered to have non-credit related risks, such as interest rate risk or liquidity factors. The Company considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies and whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
670
 and 
704
 individual available-for-sale investment securities, respectively, that were in an unrealized loss position, which was related primarily to fluctuations in current interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had the intent and ability to hold these investment securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in cost.
The Company had 
no
 ACL for available-for-sale corporate investment securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
On a quarterly basis, the Company refreshes the credit quality indicator of each held-to-maturity security. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the held-to-maturity portfolio is composed of investment grade or better securities. The Company had a $
0.9
 million and a $
0.8
 million ACL for held-to-maturity corporate and state, county, and municipal investment securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
29.6
 million and $
38.5
 million, respectively, of accrued interest receivable from investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets. Accrued interest receivable is presented as a separate line item on the consolidated balance sheets and is not included in the carrying value of our securities.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 material gross realized gains or losses on the disposition of available-for-sale investment securities. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were 
no
 material gross realized gains and $
23.5
 million and $
46.8
 million of gross realized losses on the disposition of available-for-sale investment securities, respectively.

(1)
 Amounts presented exclude the ACL related to unfunded commitments and investment securities. The allowance for credit losses related to unfunded commitments and investment securities are included in the “Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk” Note and “Investment Securities” Note, respectively.
(2)

Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the ACL when management believes the collectability of the principal is unlikely, or, with respect to consumer installment loans, according to an established delinquency schedule.
Collateral-Dependent Loans
A collateral-dependent loan relies substantially on the operation or sale of the collateral securing the loan for repayment. A loan may become collateral-dependent when foreclosure is probable or the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and its sources of repayment become inadequate over time.

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
Modifications of loans are made in the ordinary course of business and are completed on a case-by-case basis through negotiation with the borrower in connection with the ongoing loan collection processes. Loan modifications are made to provide payment relief to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.
From time to time, we may modify certain loans to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. In some cases, these modifications may result in new loans. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension, or a combination thereof, among other things.

Balances based on loan original contractual terms.

The Company monitors the performance of loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts. Of the loans that were modified during the twelve-months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 and $
6.7
 million of loans classified as past due 30 days or more, respectively, with the remaining loans performing in accordance with the modified terms and classified as current at December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
There were no commitments to lend additional funds related to loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
There were $
20.9
 million of payment defaults on these loans subsequent to their modifications during the twelve-months ended December 31, 2024 and none in 2023. The Company considers a payment default to occur when the loan is 90 days or more past due or the loan is placed on non-accrual status after the modification. The Company monitors the performance of modified loans on an ongoing basis. In the event of subsequent default, the ACL continues to be reassessed based on an individual evaluation of each loan. The modifications made during the periods presented did not significantly impact the Company’s determination of the ACL.

Credit Quality Indicators
As part of the on-going and continuous monitoring of the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, management tracks internally assigned risk classifications of loans based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt. The factors considered by the Company include, among other factors, the borrower’s current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends. The Company analyzes loans individually to classify the credit risk of the loans. This analysis generally includes loans with an outstanding balance greater than $1.0 million, which are generally considered non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. This analysis is performed no less than on an annual basis, depending upon the size of exposure and the contractual obligations governing the borrower’s financial reporting frequency. Homogeneous loans, including small business loans, are typically monitored by payment performance. The Company internally risk rates its loans in accordance with a Uniform Classification System developed jointly by the various bank regulatory agencies. The Uniform Classification System defines three broad categories of criticized assets, which the Company uses as credit quality indicators in addition to the 6 Pass ratings in its 10-point rating scale:
Special Mention
 — includes loans that exhibit a potential weakness in financial condition, loan structure, or documentation that warrants management’s close attention. If not promptly corrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution’s credit position at some future date.
Substandard
 — includes loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower which have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Although the primary source of repayment for a substandard loan may not currently be sufficient, collateral or other sources of repayment are sufficient to satisfy the debt. Continuance of a substandard loan is not warranted unless positive steps are taken to improve the worthiness of the credit.
Doubtful
 — includes loans that exhibit pronounced weaknesses based on currently existing facts, conditions, and values to a point where collection or liquidation for full repayment is highly questionable and improbable. Doubtful loans are required to be placed on non-accrual status and are assigned specific loss exposure.
Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above-described process are considered pass-rated loans. A pass-rated loan can be assets where there is virtually no credit risk, such as cash secured loans with funds on deposit with the Bank. Pass rated loans also include loans that are on our watch lists, where the borrower exhibits potential weaknesses, which may, if not checked or corrected, negatively affect the borrower's financial capacity and threaten their ability to fulfill debt obligations in the future.

(8)    DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through the management of its business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swap contracts to manage or hedge exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates and interest rate exposures. The Company does not enter into interest rate swap agreements for trading or speculative purposes. 
The Company sells residential mortgage loans on either a best efforts or mandatory delivery basis. The Company mitigates the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing interest rate lock commitments by entering into forward loan sales contracts. The forward loan sales contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges. Exclusive of the fair value component associated with the projected cash flows from the loan delivery to the investor, the changes in fair value related to movements in market rates of the interest rate lock commitments and the forward loan sales contracts generally move in opposite directions, and the net impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential. When the loan is funded to the borrower, the interest rate lock commitment expires, and the Company records a loan held for sale. The forward loan sales contract acts as a hedge against movements in the market interest rates from the time the Company enters into the interest rate lock commitment. The changes in measurement of the estimated fair values of the interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sales contracts are included in mortgage banking revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company charges a fee for these transactions, which is included in mortgage banking revenues on the consolidated statements of income which were 
not
 material for the periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Company also enters into certain interest rate swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivative contracts relate to transactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap with a client while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with a third-party financial institution. Because the Company acts as an intermediary for the client, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts primarily offset each other and do not significantly impact the Company’s results of operations. The Company charges a fee for these transactions, which is included in other service charges, commissions, and fees on the consolidated statements of income which were 
not
 material for the periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest income (expense) and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and collars as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  
As part of the Company’s overall asset and liability management strategy, the Company entered into two interest rate collars related to variable-rate loans that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of $
300.0
 million and entered into four swaps, two of which were related to variable-rate loans and two that were related to variable-rate securities that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of $
850.0
 million. The collars designated as cash flow hedges synthetically fix the interest income received by the Company when the interest index falls below a floor rate on a rate reset and when the interest index exceeds the cap rate on a rate reset. Each of the swaps designated as cash flow hedges synthetically fixes the interest income received by the Company. 
During 2024, the Company voluntarily terminated three swaps, two of which were related to variable-rate loans and one related to variable-rate securities that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of $
550.0
 million. The termination of the cash flow hedges resulted in a net loss of $
0.2
 million being captured in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, and reclassified to interest income over the period the forecasted transactions affect earnings.
The active two interest rate collars and one remaining swap designated as cash flow hedges were effective with a total notional amount of $
600.0
 million. 
101
Table of Contents
FIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) 
For derivatives that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into interest income in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified as interest income when interest payments on the Company’s hedged items are earned. During the next twelve months, based on implied forward curves, the Company estimates that $
2.6
 million will be reclassified as an adjustment to interest income.  
Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company discontinued a fair value hedging relationship, resulting in an $
8.5
 million hedging basis adjustment on the previously hedged investment securities. The hedging basis adjustment is being accreted into income through July 2028 or until the securities are sold. The Company accreted $
1.4
 million of the adjustment into interest income during the period ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income. 
The following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheets related to cumulative basis adjustment for the discontinued fair value hedge for the periods indicated:
December 31, 2024
December 31, 2023

Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges
Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously economically hedged by offsetting derivatives that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized in other income.
Risk Participation Agreements
The Company acquired, from Great Western Bank, risk participation agreements under which it assumed credit risk associated with a borrower’s performance related to derivative contracts. The Company only entered into these credit risk participation agreements in instances in which the Company was also a party to the related loan participation agreements for such borrowers. The Company manages its credit risk under risk participation agreements by monitoring the creditworthiness of the borrower, based on its normal credit review process. 
The following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross and net basis for the periods indicated. The derivative asset and liability balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements, but after the variation margin payments with central clearing organizations have been applied as settlement, as applicable. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted to account for the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. Securities collateral related to legally enforceable master netting agreements is not offset on the consolidated balance sheets.

Credit-risk-related Contingent Feature
The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. In addition, the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the Company's default on the indebtedness.

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) 
The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well / adequately capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Bank would be required to settle its obligations. Similarly, the Bank could be required to settle its obligations under certain of its agreements if specific regulatory events occur, such as a publicly issued prompt corrective action directive, cease and desist order, or a capital maintenance agreement that required the Bank to maintain a specific capital level. If the Bank had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2024 or 2023, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value. 
As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, was 
zero
 related to these agreements. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties and has 
not
 posted excess collateral. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2024, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value.

Debt issuance costs consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and professional fees were capitalized and are being amortized through maturity to interest expense using the straight-line method, which approximates level yield.
The terms of the Trust Preferred Securities are identical to those of the Subordinated Debentures. The Trust Preferred Securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon repayment of the Subordinated Debentures at their stated maturity dates or earlier redemption in an amount equal to their liquidation amount plus accumulated and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption. The Company guarantees the payment of distributions and payments for redemption or liquidation of the Trust Preferred Securities to the extent of funds held by the Trusts.
In conjunction with the acquisition of Northwest in August 2018, the Company acquired Northwest Bancorporation Capital Trust I (“Trust VII”). The Northwest Trust was formed for the exclusive purpose of issuing an aggregate of $

REGULATORY CAPITAL
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s and the Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s and Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Parent Company, like all bank holding companies, is not subject to the prompt corrective action provisions. The Company’s and the Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of tier 1 capital to average assets, as defined in the regulations. As of December 31, 2024, the Company exceeded all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. 
As of December 31, 2024, the most recent notification from the regulatory agencies categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well-capitalized, the institution must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. There are no conditions or events since the most recent notification that management believes have changed the Bank's categories.
As an approved mortgage seller, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum level of capital specified by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bank met these requirements.

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) 
In connection with the adoption of current expected credit losses (“CECL”), or ASC 326, on January 1, 2020, the Company recognized an after-tax cumulative effect reduction to retained earnings totaling $
24.1
 million. In March 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC issued an interim final rule that allows banking organizations to mitigate the effects of ASC 326 on their regulatory capital computations. This interim rule is in addition to the three-year transition period already in place under the capital transition rule previously issued in February 2019. Banking organizations can elect to mitigate the estimated cumulative regulatory capital effects for an additional two years. This rule allows an institution to defer incorporating the impact of ASC 326 into its regulatory capital calculation, including ratios, over an extended period. Additionally, the interim rule extends the transition period whereby an institution can defer the impact from ASC 326 on the current period, determined based on the difference between the new ASC 326 allowance for credit losses and the allowance for loan losses under the incurred loss method from previous GAAP, for up to two years. The total impact related to ASC 326 would then be transitioned into regulatory capital and the associated ratios over a three-year transition period, beginning after the initial two-year deferral period, for a total transition period of five years. The Company elected to opt into the transition election and adopted transition relief over the permissible five-year period. The transitionary period ended on January 1, 2025.

Residential mortgage loans sold to investors in the secondary market are sold with varying recourse provisions. Based on the specific terms stated in the agreements, the Company did 
not
 have a significant amount of sold residential mortgage loans with recourse provisions still in effect as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company did not repurchase a significant amount of loans from secondary market investors under the terms of loan sales agreements during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. In the opinion of management, the risk of recourse and the subsequent requirement of loan repurchase to the Company is not significant, and accordingly no liabilities have been established related to such. In addition, the Company made various representations and warranties associated with the sale of loans. The Company has not incurred significant losses resulting from these provisions. 
A substantial portion of the Company’s clients’ ability to honor their contracts is dependent on the financial conditions in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming. The Company’s loan portfolio is diversified and assigned to risk classifications by industry concentrations. These industry concentrations of credit are taken into consideration by management in determining the ACL.

In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various other claims and litigation. In the opinion of management, following consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate liability or disposition thereof is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of the Company.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK
In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its clients. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to clients. The Company’s policy for obtaining collateral, and determining the nature of such collateral, is essentially the same as in the Company’s policies for making commitments to extend credit. The estimated fair value of the obligation undertaken by the Company in issuing standby letters of credit is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

 As of December 31, 2024, the Company had remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards of $
2.0
 million from acquired companies, which is available to offset federal taxable income, and state net operating loss carryforwards in amounts which vary by state. The federal net operating losses will expire in 2030 and the state net operating losses of $
11.6
 million began expiring in 2023 and ending in 2036. The use of these carryforwards is subject to annual limitations. The Company believes it is more likely than not that these items will be utilized within the carryforward period.
A valuation allowance was not required for the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 because it is more likely than not these assets will be realized through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and future taxable income. Uncertain tax positions were not significant at December 31, 2024 or 2023.
The Company had current net income tax receivables of $
22.2
 million and $
16.4
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and also in various states. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2021.
The Company holds investments in certain tax-advantaged limited partnerships whose purpose is to invest in qualified affordable housing projects and community revitalization projects. The Company’s investments in these entities generate a return primarily through the realization of federal income tax credits and other tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of the investments, over specified time periods. 
The carrying value of the Company’s tax credit investments was $
103.8
 million and $
90.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reported within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 the Company recorded $
11.6
 million, $
9.3
 million, and $
3.6
 million, respectively, of amortization related to these investments under the proportional amortization method within the 
provision for income taxes
, and $
0.4
 million, $
2.8
 million, and $
3.3
 million of amortization within other 
non-interest expense
 on the consolidated statements of income.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 the Company recorded $
13.3
 million, $
9.8
 million, and $
8.5
 million, respectively, in tax credits and other tax benefits within the 
provision for income taxes
 on its consolidated statements of income.
The Company's unfunded capital commitments to these investments were $
25.2
 million and $
32.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reported within accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has equity awards outstanding under two stock-based compensation plans; the 2023 Equity and Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”) and the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “2015 Plan”). These plans were primarily established to enhance the Company’s ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees. The Company’s Board or, upon delegation, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the Board (“Compensation Human Capital Committee”) has exclusive authority to select employees, advisors and others, including directors, to receive awards and to establish the terms and conditions of each award made pursuant to the Company’s stock-based compensation plan.
The 2023 Plan, approved by the Company’s shareholders in May 2023, was established to provide the Company with flexibility to select from various equity-based performance compensation methods, and to be able to address changing accounting and tax rules and corporate governance practices by optimally utilizing performance-based compensation. At December 31, 2024, there were 
2,553,800
 common shares available for future grant under the 2023 Plan. 
The 2015 Plan, approved by the Company’s shareholders in May 2015, was established to provide the Company with flexibility to select from various equity-based performance compensation methods, and to be able to address changing accounting and tax rules and corporate governance practices by optimally utilizing performance-based compensation. Upon approval of the 2023 Plan, the remaining common shares available for future grant under the 2015 were forfeited. The 2015 Plan continues with respect to the awards made prior to June 2023. 
Restricted Stock.
 Common stock issued under the Company’s restricted stock plans may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions have lapsed or performance objectives have been obtained. During the vesting periods, participants have voting rights and receive dividends on all time restricted shares and vesting performance restricted shares under the 2015 Plan. During the vesting periods, under the 2023 Plan, participants do not have voting rights and dividends are accumulated until the time upon which the award vests. Upon termination of employment, common shares upon which restrictions have not lapsed must be returned to the Company. The vesting requirements under both plans are time-vested, performance-vested, or a combination of both. Currently, time-vested grants vest ratably over three years from the date of grant. Performance-vested grants cliff-vest at the end of a three-year period based on the Company’s performance to peers. 
All restricted share awards are classified as equity awards. The fair value of equity-classified restricted stock is based on the market price of the stock on the measurement date and is amortized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the period restrictions lapse or the end of the performance period. Stock compensation is recognized based on the number of awards to vest using actual forfeiture amounts. For performance-based stock, an estimate is made of the number of shares expected to vest as a result of actual performance against the performance targets to determine the amount of compensation expense to be recognized. The estimate is reevaluated quarterly and total compensation expense is adjusted for any change in the current period. 
Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock of $
11.8
 million, $
4.7
 million and $
9.6
 million was included in employee benefits on the Company’s consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There is a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. 
The three levels of inputs to measure fair value are as follows:
•    Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
•    Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities
•    Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of assets or liabilities
The methodologies used by the Company in determining the fair values of each class of financial instruments are based primarily on independent, market-based data to reflect a value that would be reasonably expected in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, and therefore are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers between levels as of the end of the reporting period. Transfers in and out of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 are recognized on the actual transfer date. There were no significant transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Further details on the methods used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments above are discussed below:  
Investment Debt Securities Available-for-Sale
. The Company obtains fair value measurements for investment securities from an independent pricing service, and these securities are classified as level 2. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the investment’s terms and conditions, among others. Vendors chosen by the Company are widely recognized vendors whose evaluations support the pricing functions of financial institutions, investment and mutual funds, and portfolio managers. If needed, a broker may be utilized to determine the reported fair value of investment securities. The Company also compares the reasonableness of the pricing quarterly through a validation process involving additional independent third parties.
Loans Held for Sale. 
Fair value measurements for residential mortgage loans held for sale are obtained from an independent pricing service and are classified as level 2. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include binding contracts or quotes or bids from third party investors as well as loan level pricing adjustments. Commercial and agricultural loans held for sale are derived from quotes or bids from third party investors.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) 
Interest Rate Collars:
 The fair values of interest rate collars are obtained from an independent third party and are classified as level 2. The values are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates fell below (rise above) the strike rate of the floors (caps).  The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the collars are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. The Company also compares the reasonableness of the pricing quarterly through a validation process involving additional independent third parties.
Interest Rate Swap Contracts.
 Fair values for derivative interest rate swap contracts are obtained from an independent third party and are classified as level 2. The values are based upon the estimated amounts to settle the contracts considering current interest rates and are calculated using discounted cash flows that are observable, or that can be corroborated by observable market data. The inputs used to determine fair value include the United States Dollar
 – 
SOFR forward curve to estimate variable rate cash inflows and the SOFR to estimate the discount rate. The estimated variable rate cash inflows are compared to the fixed rate outflows and such difference is discounted to a present value to estimate the fair value of the interest rate swaps. The Company also compares the reasonableness of the pricing quarterly through a validation process involving additional independent third parties.
For purposes of potential valuation adjustments to our derivative positions, we evaluate both our credit risk and the credit risk of our counterparties. Accordingly, we have considered factors such as the likelihood of our default and the default of our counterparties, our net exposures and remaining contractual life, among other things, in determining if any fair value adjustments related to credit risk are required. The change in value of derivative assets and derivative liabilities attributable to credit risk was not significant during the reported periods.
Interest Rate Lock Commitments.
 Fair value measurements for interest rate lock commitments are obtained from an independent pricing service and are classified as level 2. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include prices available from secondary market investors taking into consideration various characteristics of the loan, including the loan amount, interest rate, value of the servicing, and loan to value ratio, among other things. Observable data is then adjusted to reflect changes in interest rates, the Company’s estimated pull-through rate, and estimated direct costs necessary to complete the commitment into a closed loan net of origination and processing fees collected from the borrower. 
Forward Loan Sales Contracts.
 The fair value measurements for forward loan sales contracts are obtained from an independent pricing service and are classified as level 2. The fair value measurements consider observable data that includes sales of similar loans.
Deferred Compensation Plan Assets and Liabilities.
 The fair values of deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities are based primarily on quoted market prices for identical instruments traded in active markets at the measurement date and are classified as level 1. These investments are in the same funds and purchased in the same amounts as the participants’ selected investments, which represent the underlying liabilities to plan participants. Deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded at amounts due to participants, based on the fair value of participants’ selected investments.

Additionally, from time to time, certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Adjustments to fair value generally result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets due to credit deterioration. 
The following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis:

Collateral-dependent Loans.
 Collateral-dependent loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from collateral. The collateral-dependent loans are reported at fair value through specific valuation allowance allocations. In addition, when it is determined that the fair value of a collateral-dependent loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, an ACL is recognized on the loan for the difference between the recorded investment and the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. Collateral values are estimated using independent appraisals and management estimates of current market conditions. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had collateral-dependent loans with a carrying and fair value of $
97.6
 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had collateral-dependent loans with a carrying and fair value of $
52.6
 million.
OREO. 
The fair values of OREO are estimated using independent appraisals and management estimates of current market conditions. Upon initial recognition, write-downs based on the foreclosed asset’s fair value at foreclosure are reported through charges to the ACL. Periodically, the fair value of foreclosed assets is remeasured with any subsequent write-downs charged to OREO expense in the period in which they are identified. 
Long-lived Assets to be Disposed of by Sale.
 Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. The fair values of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are based upon observable market data and management estimates of current market conditions. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale with carrying and fair values aggregating $
0.8 million
. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale with carrying values aggregating $
1.0 million

The Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate fair value. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are discussed above. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of other financial instruments are discussed below. For financial instruments bearing a variable interest rate where no credit risk exists, it is presumed that recorded book values are reasonable estimates of fair value.
Financial Assets.
 Carrying values of cash, cash equivalents, and accrued interest receivable approximate fair values due to the liquid and/or short-term nature of these instruments. Fair values for investment securities held-to-maturity are obtained from an independent pricing service, which considers observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the investment’s terms and conditions, among other things. Fair values of fixed rate loans and variable rate loans that reprice on an infrequent basis are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality using an exit price notion. Carrying values of variable rate loans that reprice frequently, and with no change in credit risk, approximate the fair values of these instruments. The estimated fair values for all loans are then reduced by the estimated life-of-the-loan aggregate credit losses in the loan portfolio.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) 
Financial Liabilities.
 The fair values of demand deposits, savings accounts, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and accrued interest payable are the amounts that are payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair values of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit are estimated using external market rates that are currently offered for deposits that have similar remaining maturities. The fixed and floating rate subordinated debentures, floating rate subordinated term loan, other borrowed funds, fixed rate subordinated term debt, and capital lease obligation are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current rates for advances that have similar characteristics.  
Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit.
 The fair value of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, is not significant.    
The estimated fair values of financial instruments that are reported in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, and are segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy that are utilized to measure fair value, are as follows:

These parties were deposit clients of the Bank and incurred indebtedness in the form of loans, as clients, of $
5.1
 million and $
11.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024, new loans and advances on existing loans of $
3.0
 million were funded, loan repayments totaled $
8.8
 million, and $
0.2
 million of loans were removed or added due to changes in related parties. 
In 2024, the Company sold its share of a hangar for use of the Company’s plane for $
0.4
 million to an entity in which James R. Scott indirectly owned a one-third interest at the time. 
On December 14, 2023, the Company completed the repurchase of 
one
 million shares of its common stock from the estate of the Homer Scott, Jr. Revocable Trust (the “Trust”) at a price of $

RECENT AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
ASU 2023-02, “
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method
” 
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, 
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method
 that permit reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Previously, this method was only available for qualifying tax equity investments in low-income housing tax credit structures. The amendments also require that a reporting entity disclose certain information in annual and interim reporting periods that enable investors to understand certain information about its investments that generate income tax credits and other income tax benefits from a tax credit program. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Amendments in this ASU became effective for the Company on January 1, 2024. The Company elected the modified retrospective approach for qualifying New Market Tax Credits and adjusted beginning retained earnings by an increase of $1.2 million related to the previously recorded deferred taxes. Prospectively, the amortization of the investment in Low Income Housing Tax Credits, Historic Tax Credits, and New Market Tax Credits are recorded net within income tax expense.
ASU 2023-06, “
Disclosure Improvements—Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative
” 
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, 
Disclosure Improvements—Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative
 that amends the ASC to incorporate certain disclosure requirements from SEC Release No. 33-10532 - Disclosure Update and Simplification that was issued in 2018. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2023-06 will have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
ASU 2023-07, “
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
” 
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 to improve disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This update does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments; however, it does require that an entity that has single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this update. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. A public entity should apply the amendments in this update retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. The Company currently has one reportable operating segment, Community Banking. The amendments in this ASU did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements and did not have a significant impact to the disclosures.
ASU 2023-09, “
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
” 
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
 that require public business entities to annually disclose (1) specific categories in their rate reconciliation; (2) additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold; (3) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes; (4) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which the income taxes paid that meet a quantitative threshold; (5) income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign; and (6) income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign. The ASU eliminates the requirement to disclose the nature and estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in the unrecognized tax benefits balance in the next 12 months and to disclose the cumulative amount of each type of temporary difference when a deferred tax liability is not recognized because of the exceptions to comprehensive recognition of deferred taxes related to subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. The amendments in this ASU became effective for the Company on January 1, 2025 and did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of income statement expenses
” 
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of income statement expenses
 that require public business entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. The amendments in this Update do not change or remove current expense disclosure requirements. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this Update should be applied either (1) prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this Update or (2) retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard and does not anticipate it will have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Subsequent events have been evaluated for potential recognition and disclosure through the date financial statements were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On January 28, 2025, the Company declared a quarterly dividend to common shareholders of $
0.47
 per share, which was paid on February 20, 2025 to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2025.  
As previously disclosed, on February 20, 2025, Marcy D. Mutch notified the Company of her intention to retire as a full-time employee at the end of 2025 and to step down after a transition period as the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective May 31, 2025. From May 31, 2025, until her planned retirement on December 31, 2025, Ms. Mutch is expected to serve as an executive advisor to the Company, assisting the Company with the transition to her announced successor, Deputy Chief Financial Officer David P. Della Camera. Thereafter, Ms. Mutch has agreed to serve as a consultant to the Company through December 31, 2026. 
On February 24, 2025, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer appointed David P. Della Camera, the Company’s existing Deputy Chief Financial Officer, to succeed Ms. Mutch as the Company’s next Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, beginning June 1, 2025. 
No other events requiring recognition or disclosure were identified.
