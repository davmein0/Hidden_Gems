Item 2. Properties
Our principal executive offices and one of our banking offices are anchor tenants in an 18-story commercial building located in Billings, Montana. The building is owned by a joint venture limited liability company in which FIB owns a 50.0% interest. We lease approximately 100,107 square feet of office space in the building. We also own a 66,112 square foot building that houses our operations center in Billings, Montana. As of December 31, 2024, we provided banking services at 300 locations in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming, of which 72 properties are leased from independent third parties, one property was leased from a related entity, and 227 physical properties are owned by us. We believe each of our facilities is suitable and adequate to meet our current operational needs.
