Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those under “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
Appian is a software company that orchestrates business processes. The Appian Platform empowers leaders to design, automate, and optimize important processes from start to finish. With our industry-leading platform and commitment to customer success, Appian is trusted by top organizations to drive transformational process change.
We have generated the majority of our revenue from sales of subscriptions, which include (1) cloud subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services and (2) term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. Our subscription contracts are priced based primarily on the number of users who access and utilize the applications built on our platform or, alternatively, non-user-based single application licenses. Our subscription contract terms generally vary from one to three years with most providing for payment in advance on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis. Due to the variability of our billing terms and the episodic nature of our customers purchasing additional subscriptions, we do not believe changes in our deferred revenue in a given period are directly correlated with our revenue growth.
We have invested in our Customer Success organization to help ensure customers are able to build and deploy applications on our platform. We have several strategic partnerships, including with Accenture, Capgemini, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, PwC, and TCS, which allow them to refer customers to us in order to purchase subscriptions. Our partners then provide professional services directly to the customers using our platform. Additionally, they often go to market with their own pre-built solutions using our platform, delivering software license revenue to us. We intend to continue focusing on adding new customers with our strategic partners. In addition, over time we expect our professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue to decline as we increasingly rely on strategic partners to help our customers deploy our software. We believe our investment in professional services, including strategic partners building their practices around Appian, will drive increased adoption of our platform.
As of December 31, 2024, we had over 1,000 customers. Our customers primarily include financial services, government, life sciences, insurance, manufacturing, energy, healthcare, telecommunications, and transportation organizations. Generally, our sales team targets its efforts to organizations with over 2,000 employees and $2.0 billion in annual revenue. Revenue from government agencies represented 32.2%, 29.1%, and 26.1% of our total revenue in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. No single end-customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2024, 2023, and 2022.
We offer our platform globally. Our platform supports multiple languages to facilitate collaboration and address challenges in multinational organizations. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, 36.6%, 35.8%, and 33.5%, respectively, of our total revenue was generated from customers outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2024, we operated in 16 countries. We believe we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow our international footprint, and we are investing in new geographies, including through investment in direct and indirect sales channels, professional services, and customer support and implementation partners.
We have experienced strong revenue growth, with revenue of $617.0 million, $545.4 million, and $468.0 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Our subscriptions revenue was $490.6 million, $412.3 million, and $340.2 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and includes sales of our cloud subscriptions, on-premises term license subscriptions, and maintenance and support. Our cloud subscriptions revenue was $368.0 million, $304.5 million, and $236.9 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
45
We have invested in developing our platform, expanding our sales and marketing and research and development capabilities, and providing general and administrative resources to support our growth. As a result, we incurred net losses of $92.3 million, $111.4 million, and $150.9 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In 2024, cash provided by operations was $6.9 million, while cash used by operations totaled $110.4 million and $106.6 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
We intend to continue to invest in our business to take advantage of our market opportunity. In 2025, we will take a more balanced approach to growth, making ongoing, targeted investments that enhance our capabilities and competitive position, while ensuring we continue on our path to profitability.
Our Business Model
Our business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of customer relationships, which is a function of the duration of a customer’s deployment of our platform as well as the price and number of subscriptions of our platform a customer purchases. We incur significant customer acquisition costs, including expenses associated with hiring new sales representatives, who can take anywhere from six months to a year to become productive given the length of our sales cycle, sales commissions, and marketing costs, all of which, with the exception of certain types of sales commissions, are expensed as incurred.
At the same time, we believe the costs we incur to retain customers and drive additional purchases of software are lower than our customer acquisition costs on a relative basis. Over time, we expect a large portion of our customers to renew their subscriptions and purchase additional subscriptions as they continue to build more applications and add more users to our platform. Over the last three completed fiscal years, we had an average cloud subscription gross revenue renewal rate of 98%, which is calculated by dividing (i) the cloud subscriptions revenue from renewing cloud customers in the current 12-month period that were cloud customers during the entirety of the prior 12-month period, giving effect to price increases but excluding additional cloud subscriptions for additional users, or upsells, by (ii) our cloud subscriptions revenue from all cloud customers in the corresponding prior 12-month period that were cloud customers during the entirety of such prior 12-month period. 
We also measure the effectiveness of our business model by comparing the lifetime value of our customer relationships to our customer acquisition costs. On a rolling 12-month basis, we estimate that for each of the past five fiscal years, the average lifetime value of a customer has been at least seven times greater than the associated average cost of acquiring them, including the year ended December 31, 2024.
Key Factors Affecting Our Performance
The following are several key factors that affect our performance:
•
Market Adoption of Our Platform -
 Our ability to grow our customer base and drive market adoption of our platform is affected by the pace at which organizations digitally transform. We expect our revenue growth will be primarily driven by the pace of adoption and penetration of our platform. We offer a leading custom software platform and intend to continue to invest to expand our customer base. The degree to which prospective customers recognize the need for our software platform and its ability to enable their organizations to digitally transform, and subsequently allocate budget dollars to purchase our software, will drive our ability to acquire new customers and increase sales to existing customers, which, in turn, will affect our future financial performance.
•
Growth of Our Customer Base -
 We believe we have a substantial opportunity to grow our customer base. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription or maintenance and support contract or a legacy perpetual license as of the specified measurement date. Furthermore, we define a new customer as an entity that has entered into its first active subscription or maintenance and support contract within one calendar year of the specified measurement date. We have aggressively invested, and intend to continue to invest, in our sales team in order to drive sales to new customers. We continue to make investments to enhance the expertise of our sales and marketing organization within our key industry verticals of financial services, government, life sciences, and insurance. In 2024, we generated over 77% of our subscriptions revenue from customers in these verticals. In addition, we have established relationships 
46
with strategic partners who work with organizations undergoing digital transformations. Our ability to continue to grow our customer base is dependent, in part, upon our ability to differentiate ourselves within the increasingly competitive markets in which we participate.
•
Further Penetration of Existing Customers -
 Our sales team seeks to generate additional revenue from existing customers by adding new users to our platform. Many of our customers begin by building a single application and then grow to build dozens of applications on our platform. Generally, the development of new applications on our platform results in the expansion of our user base within an organization and a corresponding increase in revenue. As a result of this “land and expand” strategy, we have generated significant additional revenue from our customer base. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including the size of our sales and professional services teams, customers’ level of satisfaction with our platform and professional services, pricing, economic conditions, and our customers’ overall spending levels. 
•
Mix of Subscriptions and Professional Services Revenue -
 We believe our professional services have driven customer success and facilitated the adoption of our platform by customers. During the initial period of deployment of our platform by a customer, we generally provide a greater amount of support in building applications and training than later in the deployment, with a typical engagement lasting from two to six months. At the same time, many of our customers have historically purchased subscriptions for only a limited set of their total potential end users. As a result of these factors, the proportion of total revenue for a customer associated with professional services is relatively high during the initial deployment period. Over time, as the need for professional services associated with user deployments decreases and the number of end users increases, we expect subscriptions revenue as a percentage of total revenue to increase. In addition, we continue to grow our base of strategic partners to provide broader customer coverage and solution delivery capabilities. These partners perform professional services with respect to any new service contracts they originate. As the usage of strategic partners expands, we expect the proportion of our total revenue from subscriptions to increase over time relative to professional services. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, 79.5%, 75.6%, and 72.7% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from sales of subscriptions, while the remaining 20.5%, 24.4%, and 27.3%, respectively, was derived from the sale of professional services.
•
Investments in Growth -
 We have made, and plan to continue to make, investments for long-term growth, including investing in our platform and infrastructure to continuously maximize their power and speed, meet the evolving needs of our customers, and take advantage of our market opportunity. We will continue to prioritize investments in revenue generating areas and limit growth in corporate functions. In addition, we will continue to grow and leverage our product development center in India to gain efficiencies in research and development spending. We may pursue strategic acquisitions that enhance our product offerings. We also intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing as we further expand our sales teams, increase our marketing activities, and grow our international operations. 
Seasonality
We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into agreements with customers. We typically enter into a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter. The increase in customer agreements for the fourth quarter is attributable to large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry. Furthermore, we usually enter into a significant portion of agreements with customers during the last month of each quarter and often the last two weeks of each quarter. However, we recognize the majority of our subscriptions revenue ratably over the terms of our subscription agreements. As a result, a substantial portion of the subscriptions revenue we report in each period will be derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to agreements entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decline in new sales or renewals in any one period may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that period. Such a decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales, the market acceptance of our platform, or potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods.
While we will continue to recognize the majority of our subscriptions revenue ratably over the terms of our subscription agreements, we may experience greater variability and reduced comparability of our quarterly revenue 
47
and results with respect to the timing and nature of our term license subscription agreements due to the upfront revenue recognition. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on our revenue recognition policies. 
Key Metrics
We monitor the following metrics to help us measure and evaluate the effectiveness of our operations. All dollar amounts are presented in thousands.

Cloud subscriptions revenue includes cloud subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, 75.0%, 73.8%, and 69.7%, respectively, of subscriptions revenue was cloud subscriptions revenue. Our cloud subscriptions revenue for any customer is primarily determined by the number of users who access and utilize the applications built on our platform or by the number of application licenses purchased, as well as the price paid. We believe increasing cloud subscriptions revenue is an indicator of the demand for our platform, the pace at which the market for our solutions is growing, the productivity of our sales team and strategic relationships in growing our customer base, and our ability to further penetrate our existing customer base.

A key factor to our success is the renewal and expansion of subscription agreements with our existing customers. We calculate this metric over a set of customers who have been with us for at least one full year. To calculate our cloud subscriptions revenue retention rate for a particular trailing 12-month period, we first establish the recurring cloud subscriptions revenue for the previous trailing 12-month period. This effectively represents recurring dollars we should expect in the current trailing 12-month period from the cohort of customers from the previous trailing 12-month period without accounting for any expansion or contraction. We subsequently measure the recurring cloud subscriptions revenue in the current trailing 12-month period from the cohort of customers from the previous trailing 12-month period. Cloud subscriptions revenue retention rate is then calculated by dividing the aggregate recurring cloud subscriptions revenue in the current trailing 12-month period by the previous trailing 12-month period. This calculation includes the combined impact on our revenue from customer non-renewals, pricing changes, and growth in the number of users on our platform. Our cloud subscriptions revenue retention rate can fluctuate from period to period due to large customer contracts in any given period. 
Key Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
We generate revenue primarily through sales of subscriptions to our platform as well as professional services. We typically sell our software on a per-user basis or through non-user-based single application licenses. We generally bill customers and collect payment for subscriptions to our platform in advance on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis. 
48
Our revenue is comprised of the following:
Subscriptions
Subscriptions revenue is primarily derived from cloud subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services and on-premises term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. Our maintenance and support agreements provide customers with the right to unspecified software upgrades, maintenance updates, patches released during the term of the maintenance and support agreement on a when-and-if-available basis, and technical support. On-premises term license subscriptions are offered when the customer prefers to self-manage the deployment of our platform within their own infrastructure. When our platform is delivered as a cloud subscription, we manage operational needs in third-party hosted data centers.
Professional Services
Our professional services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services, including application development, deployment assistance, and training related to our platform. Over time, we expect professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue to decrease as the usage of our partner network expands.
Cost of Revenue
Subscriptions
Cost of subscriptions revenue consists primarily of fees paid to our third-party managed hosting providers and other third-party service providers, personnel costs, including payroll and benefits for our technology operations and customer support teams, amortization of acquired technology, and allocated overhead costs. We expect cost of revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as our customer base grows.
Professional Services
Cost of professional services revenue includes all direct and indirect costs to deliver our professional services and training, including employee compensation for our global professional services and training personnel, third-party contractor costs, allocated overhead costs, and the costs of billable expenses such as travel and lodging. The unpredictability of the timing of providing services related to significant professional services agreements sold on a standalone basis may cause significant fluctuations in our cost of professional services which, in turn, may impact our financial results.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit and gross margin (defined as gross profit as a percentage of total revenue), have been, and will continue to be, affected by various factors, including the mix of cloud subscriptions and on-premises term license subscriptions, the mix of total subscriptions revenue and professional services revenue, subscription pricing, the costs associated with third-party hosting providers, and the extent to which we expand or reduce our professional services to support future changes in our growth. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on the preceding factors.
Subscriptions Gross Margin 
Subscriptions gross margin is primarily affected by the growth in our subscriptions revenue as compared to the growth in, and timing of, costs to support such revenue. We expect to continue to invest in customer support and cloud operations to support growth in our business, and the timing of those investments is expected to cause subscriptions gross margin to fluctuate on a quarterly basis.
49
Professional Services Gross Margin
Professional services gross margin is affected by the growth in our professional services revenue as compared to the growth in, and timing of, the costs of our Customer Success organization as well as by consultant utilization rates. Professional services gross margin is also impacted by the amount of services performed by subcontractors and partners as opposed to internal resources. In 2025, we expect professional services gross margin to be consistent with 2024; however, the margin remains subject to fluctuation based on the factors discussed above. 
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel-related costs such as salaries, bonuses, commissions, payroll tax payments, severance costs, and stock-based compensation expense are the most significant components of each of these expense categories. Other components of each category include professional fees for third-party services such as legal, software development resources, contractors, and cloud computing services. In addition, operating expenses include allocated overhead costs, which are primarily comprised of facility costs such as rent, employee medical benefits, employee relations expense, and certain information technology costs.
In general, our operating expenses are expected to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we invest resources in enhancing our product and growing our business, although such growth is expected to be at a more measured rate than prior years. In 2024, our total employee headcount decreased from 2,257 employees at December 31, 2023 to 2,033 employees at December 31, 2024. In 2025, we expect overall headcounts to rise slightly as we hire new employees in key growth areas while maintaining headcounts at or near current levels in non-customer facing teams. 
Sales and Marketing Expense
Sales and marketing expense primarily includes personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, commissions, stock-based compensation, and other personnel costs related to sales teams. Additional major expenses in this category include travel and entertainment, marketing activities and promotional events, subcontracting fees, and allocated overhead costs. 
The number of employees in sales and marketing functions decreased from 666 at December 31, 2023 to 509 at December 31, 2024. While headcount declined in 2024 due to changes in our go-to-market functions, we expect sales and marketing headcount to marginally increase from current levels in 2025 due to expected growth in our principal markets and strategic growth areas. Furthermore, we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in acquiring new customers, further expand usage of our platform within our existing customer base, and broaden our efforts to build on our brand reputation and increase market awareness of our platform. 
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our employees who develop and enhance our platform, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and other personnel costs. Also included are non-personnel costs such as subcontracting, consulting, professional fees to third party development resources, certain information technology expenses, and allocated overhead costs.
Our research and development efforts are focused on enhancing the capabilities, speed, and power of our software platform. The number of employees in research and development functions increased from 681 at December 31, 2023 to 702 at December 31, 2024. Most of this increase was attributable to continued expansion at our product development center in India that we opened in August 2022. Although we expect research and development expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as such costs are critical to maintain and improve the quality of applications and our competitive position, we believe our product development center will result in cost efficiencies over time.
50
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and other personnel costs for our administrative, legal, information technology, human resources, finance and accounting teams as well as our senior executives. Additional expenses included in this category are non-personnel costs such as travel-related expenses, contracting and professional fees for such services as audits, taxation, and legal, insurance and other corporate expenses, including allocated overhead costs, and bad debt expenses.
The number of employees in general and administrative functions decreased from 280 at December 31, 2023 to 267 at December 31, 2024. In 2025, we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars largely due to investments in our information technology team. 
Other Non-Operating Expense
Other Expense (Income), Net
Other expense (income), net, consists primarily of gains and losses related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments, and other sources of income or expense not related to our core business operations.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of interest on our debt, amortization of deferred financing fees, unused credit facility fees, and commitment fees on our letters of credit.

Total revenue increased $71.7 million, or 13.1%, in 2024 compared to 2023 due to an increase in our subscriptions revenue of $78.2 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in our professional services revenue of $6.6 million. The increase in subscriptions revenue was driven by a $63.5 million increase in cloud subscriptions revenue, a $9.9 million increase in on-premises software revenue, and a $4.8 million increase in maintenance and support revenue. With respect to new versus existing customers, $63.3 million of the increase in subscriptions revenue was derived from expanded deployments and corresponding sales of additional subscriptions to existing customers while $14.9 million was driven from sales of subscriptions to new customers. The decrease in professional services revenue was due to an $18.7 million decrease in revenue from existing customers, which was partially offset by a $12.1 million increase in sales to new customers.

Cost of revenue increased $6.9 million, or 4.8%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to an $8.5 million increase in hosting costs and a $0.2 million increase in professional services and product support personnel costs, both of which were partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in contractor costs. Hosting costs increased due to an increase in sales of our cloud offering during 2024. Although professional services and product support personnel headcount decreased 11.9% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024, personnel costs increased due to a $1.2 million increase in severance costs and slightly higher salaries and benefits, which were substantially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in bonus expense and a $0.5 million decrease in stock compensation expense. Contractor costs decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to a decrease in the usage of subcontractors for professional service engagements. 
Subscriptions gross margin was 89.1% in 2024, consistent with an 89.4% margin in the prior year as increases in subscriptions revenue were offset by a corresponding increase in hosting costs. Professional services gross margin decreased to 23.5% in 2024 as compared to 25.0% in 2023 due to a decline in professional services revenue and a marginal increase in personnel costs, both of which were partially offset by lower contractor costs. Total gross margin increased to 75.7% in 2024 as compared to 73.7% in 2023 driven largely by the increase in subscriptions revenue.

Personnel costs decreased due to a 23.6% decrease in sales and marketing personnel headcount from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 and a $2.6 million decrease in stock compensation expense, both of which were partially offset by a $3.5 million increase in sales commissions driven by both contracts with new customers and renewals with existing customers. Information technology costs decreased primarily due to lower cloud computing expenses. Marketing costs increased due to a $3.2 million increase in spending on marketing events, in addition to increases in digital marketing and public relations expense. Travel and entertainment expenses rose due to increases in airfare and lodging associated with a higher number of in-person events and engagements relative to the prior year.

Research and development expense increased $1.9 million, or 1.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $1.9 million increase in employee medical benefits and a $1.8 million increase in information technology costs. These increases were partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in research and development personnel costs. Information technology costs increased primarily due to higher cloud computing expense. Although research and development personnel headcount increased 3.1% from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024, personnel costs decreased due to realized cost savings from our product development center in India, a $1.0 million decrease in severance expense, and a $0.8 million decrease in stock compensation expense.

General and administrative expense increased $27.3 million, or 23.8%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $9.8 million increase in amortization expense related to our judgment preservation insurance policy. Additionally, professional fees increased $7.4 million, which was the result of higher net legal fees driven by a $5.7 million decrease in insurance reimbursements associated with our litigation against Pegasystems as a result of receiving reimbursements in the prior year compared to none in the current year. Rent expense also increased $6.9 million, primarily attributable to a $5.5 million in lease impairment charge recognized in the second quarter of 2024. These increases were partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in general and administrative personnel costs, driven largely by a 4.6% decrease in general and administrative headcount from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024.

Other expense, net was $6.8 million in 2024 compared to other income, net of $17.6 million in 2023. There were $16.8 million in foreign exchange losses in 2024 compared to $8.7 million in foreign exchange gains in 2023. Additionally, there was a $2.1 million decrease in interest income across the comparative periods. These decreases were partially offset by a $3.2 million increase in other income attributable to payments received in 2024, including a payment from a local government as a result of achieving certain economic development criteria and payments related to a short-swing profit disgorgement paid to us by a public shareholder of our Class A common stock.

Income tax expense decreased by $2.2 million in 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. This change was primarily driven by decreased pre-tax book income in certain international subsidiaries in 2024. The change in pre-tax book income was primarily attributable to increases in unrealized foreign exchange losses.
Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2022
For a discussion and analysis of changes in financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024. 
Backlog
Backlog represents non-cancellable future amounts to be recognized under cloud and on-premises term license subscription agreements and is representative of our remaining performance obligations. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had backlog of $546.0 million and $489.7 million, respectively. Approximately 34% of our backlog as of December 31, 2024 is not expected to be recognized in 2025. Additionally, we expect backlog to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase the number of cloud agreements we enter into. However, the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts can change from quarter to quarter and year to year for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of cloud and on-premises term license subscription agreements with large customers, the specific timing of customer renewals, changes in customer financial circumstances, and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, we often sign multiple-year subscription agreements, and backlog may vary based on changes in the average non-cancellable term of our cloud and on-premises term license subscription agreements.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide investors with certain non-GAAP financial performance measures. We use these non-GAAP financial performance measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. We believe both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing 
56
future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to historical performance as well as comparisons to competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
Our non-GAAP financial performance measures include the following: non-GAAP subscriptions cost of revenue, non-GAAP professional services cost of revenue, non-GAAP total cost of revenue, non-GAAP total operating expense, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net loss, and non-GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted. These non-GAAP financial performance measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense, certain non-ordinary litigation-related expenses consisting of legal and other professional fees associated with the Pegasystems cases (net of insurance reimbursements), or Litigation Expense, amortization of the judgment preservation insurance policy, or JPI Amortization, severance costs related to involuntary reductions in our workforce, or Severance Costs, lease impairment and lease-related charges associated with actions taken to reduce the footprint of our leased office spaces, or Lease Impairment and Lease-Related Charges, and a short-swing profit disgorgement paid to us by a shareholder, or Short-Swing Profit Payment. While some of these items may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods as these items can vary significantly from period to period depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may occur. Therefore, while we may incur or recognize these types of expenses in the future, we believe removing these items for purposes of calculating our non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with a more focused presentation of our ongoing operating performance. 
 We also discuss adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial performance measure we believe offers a useful view of the overall operation of our business. We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before (1) other expense (income), net, (2) interest expense, (3) income tax expense, (4) depreciation expense and amortization of intangible assets, (5) stock-based compensation expense, (6) Litigation Expense, (7) JPI Amortization, (8) Severance Costs, and (9) Lease Impairment and Lease-Related Charges. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted EBITDA is net loss. Users should consider the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA, including the fact this measure does not provide a complete measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternative to net loss as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. 
The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and marketable securities, together with any positive cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our line of credit, will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
We have in the past, and may in the future, enter into investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, or technologies, which could also require us to seek additional equity financing, incur indebtedness, or use cash resources. We have no present binding agreements or commitments to enter into any such acquisitions. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Sources of Funds
 We have historically financed our operations in large part with equity financing arrangements. Our last public offering was completed in June 2020. Through these public offerings, we received net proceeds of $344.8 million. 

To further help strengthen our financial position and support our growth initiatives, in November 2022 we entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facilities Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement, which, as amended to date, provides for a five-year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million and, in addition, up to $100.0 million for a revolving credit facility, including a letter of credit sub-facility in the aggregate availability amount of $20.0 million and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate availability amount of $10.0 million (as a sublimit of the revolving loan facility). 
59
The Credit Agreement matures on November 3, 2027. We have been using the proceeds to fund the growth of our business and support our working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants, had used borrowing capacity of $62.0 million under our $100.0 million revolving credit facility, and had outstanding letters of credit totaling $14.6 million in connection with securing our leased office space.
We expect future sources of funds to consist primarily of cash generated from sales of subscriptions and the related professional services. We may also elect to raise additional sources of funding through draws on our revolving credit facility, entering into new debt financing arrangements or conducting additional public offerings. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product solutions and functions as well as platform enhancements and professional services offerings, and the level of market acceptance of our product. 
Uses of Funds
Our current principal uses of cash are funding operations and other working capital requirements. Historically, we have also utilized cash to pay for the acquisition of businesses that were complementary to ours, and we may pursue similar opportunities in the future. Over the past several years, revenue has increased significantly from year to year and, as a result, cash flows from customer collections have also grown. However, as we continue to invest in growing our business, operating expenses have also increased.
In 2023, we entered into a Judgment Preservation Insurance policy in connection with our $2.036 billion judgment against Pegasystems. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. The total cost of the policy was $57.3 million, which we paid with operating cash on hand. In addition, in February 2024 our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program, under which we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock for approximately $50.0 million during the first quarter of 2024. 
Outside of the above items and cash used by operations, other uses of cash in 2024 included capital expenditures related to the expansion of the recently leased facility for our research development center in India and principal repayments of our term loan debt.
Furthermore, we have a non-cancellable cloud hosting arrangement with Amazon Web Services that contains provisions for minimum purchase commitments. Specifically, purchase commitments under the agreement total $220.0 million over five years. The agreement, which was originated in July 2021 and amended in October 2024, currently contains minimum annual spending requirements of $44.0 million from November 2024 to October 2029. Spending under this agreement for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 totaled $41.2 million, $36.6 million, and $33.1 million, respectively. The timing of payments under the agreement may vary, and the total amount of payments may exceed the minimum depending on the volume of services utilized. We expect to meet our minimum annual spending requirement during the term of the arrangement.

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $6.9 million for 2024 as compared to net cash used by operating activities of $110.4 million for 2023. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the prior year payment of $57.3 million for our judgment preservation insurance policy. Additionally, there were stronger cash collections from accounts receivable as a result of increased revenues as well as reduced expenditures stemming from headcount reductions and other cost management activities in 2024 as compared to 2023.
Investing Activities
Net cash used by investing activities was $35.4 million for 2024 as compared to $28.6 million in net cash provided by investing activities for 2023. This change was primarily driven by a decline of $71.6 million in proceeds from investments. This decrease was partially offset by a $5.8 million decrease in capital expenditures and a $1.8 million decrease in purchases of investments.
Financing Activities
Net cash used by financing activities was $0.3 million for 2024 as compared to $79.2 million in net cash provided by financing activities for 2023. This change was primarily due to a $50.0 million increase in share repurchases, a $42.0 million decrease in proceeds from borrowings, and a $2.7 million increase in principal payments on the term loan, partially offset by a $13.7 million increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and a $1.8 million decrease in payments for employee tax withholdings associated with the net settlement of stock awards.
61
For a discussion and analysis of net cash used by or provided by operating, investing, and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024. 
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements and accompanying notes. Although we believe the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates. 
We believe the following accounting estimates embedded in our revenue recognition involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe the estimates included in our revenue recognition accounting are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. This commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the remainder of this Form 10-K. 
Revenue Recognition 
We generate subscriptions revenue primarily through the sale of cloud subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services and term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. We generate professional services revenue from fees for our consulting services, including application development and deployment assistance and training related to our platform. Significant judgments and estimates inherent in our revenue recognition are as follows:
Determining the Transaction Price
The transaction price, or the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring services to our customers, includes both fixed and variable components. The variable components of our contracts, which have been nominal to date, include performance penalties, extended payment terms or implied price concessions, and warranty refunds. If necessary, we estimate these components using the expected value method, which estimates variable consideration as the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. We believe this method is the most appropriate to utilize because our variable components could vary by contract, leading to multiple potential outcomes. 
Our variable consideration estimates are subject to subsequent true-up adjustments which may result in changes to transaction prices, but such true-up adjustments are not expected to be material. Variable consideration is also included in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable a significant reversal will not occur. Factors considered when determining to incorporate variable consideration in the transaction price include, but are not limited to, whether the variable consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside of the Company's influence, the length of time the uncertainty surrounding reversal is expected to last, our experience levels with similar types of contracts, our historical practices for similar contracts in similar circumstances, and the number and range of possible consideration amounts. The amount of variable consideration excluded from the transaction price for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was immaterial.
Allocating the Transaction Price Based on Standalone Selling Prices
We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in a contract based on its relative standalone selling price, or SSP. The SSP is the observable price at which we sell the product or service separately. In the absence of observable pricing, we estimate SSP using the residual approach. We establish SSP as follows:
62
1.
Cloud subscriptions - Given the highly variable selling price of our could subscriptions, we establish the SSP of our cloud subscriptions using a residual approach after first determining the SSP of consulting and training services. 
2.
On-premises term license subscriptions - Given the highly variable selling price of our term license subscriptions, we have established the SSP of term license subscriptions using a residual approach after first determining the SSP of maintenance and support. Maintenance and support is sold on a standalone basis with renewals of our legacy perpetual software licenses and within a narrow range of the net license fee, resulting in a defined economic relationship existing between the license and maintenance and support.
3.
Maintenance and support - We establish the SSP of maintenance and support as a percentage of the stated net subscription fee based on observable pricing of maintenance and support renewals from our legacy perpetual software licenses. 
4.
Consulting services and training services - The SSP of consulting services and training services is established based on the observable pricing of standalone sales within each geographic region where the services are sold.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Interest Rate Risk
We had cash and cash equivalents of $118.6 million as of December 31, 2024, which consisted of investments in a money market fund, cash in readily available checking accounts, and overnight repurchase investments.
In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we held $41.3 million of fixed income securities such as U.S. treasury bonds, commercial paper, and corporate bonds. These securities are subject to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair value of our investments. We classify investments as available-for-sale, including those with stated maturities beyond 12 months. As such, no gains or losses due to changes in interest rates are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or due to expected credit losses. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the fair market value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2024. To date, fluctuations in interest income have also not been significant. Our investments are made for the purpose of preserving capital, fulfilling liquidity needs, and maximizing total return. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.
As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding debt of $250.4 million, which carries interest as defined in our Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements in this 2024 Annual Report for additional details. We assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing sensitivity to our operating results assuming various changes in market interest rates. A hypothetical increase of one percentage point in the interest rate as of December 31, 2024 would increase our interest expense by approximately $2.5 million annually.
Inflation Risk
We are exposed to market risks related to inflation in personnel costs, third-party service providers, subcontracting costs, professional fees, and general overhead expenses. Although inflation has decreased from the relative highs experienced in 2023, if inflation pressure increases in severity, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases and productivity initiatives. While we do not believe inflation has had a material 
63
impact on our results of operations to date, a continued high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain operating costs and adversely affect our gross profit margin.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Due to our international operations, we have foreign currency risks related to revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling, Euro, Australian dollar, and Swiss franc. Our sales contracts are primarily denominated in the local currency of the customer making the purchase. In addition, portions of operating expenses are incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies. An increase in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will negatively affect revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Based on a sensitivity analysis, a 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted our total revenue by approximately 4% and our operating loss by approximately 8%. This calculation assumes all currencies change in the same direction and proportion relative to the U.S. dollar. 
We have experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in net loss as a result of transaction gains or losses related to remeasuring certain current asset and current liability balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. We have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions to date, although we may choose to do so in the future.

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Appian Corporation (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition for Multiple Performance Obligations 
66
As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, certain of the Company's revenue contracts contain multiple performance obligations that might include cloud subscriptions, term license subscriptions, maintenance and support and professional services. The Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. In such cases, the transaction price is allocated to the distinct performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling price, which either is the observable price at which the Company sells the product or service separately, or estimated standalone selling price using a residual approach in the absence of observable pricing. Revenue is recognized when control of the distinct performance obligation is transferred.
We identified the revenue recognition for certain revenue contracts as a critical audit matter due to the significant management judgment involved in the identification of distinct performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Auditing these elements of revenue recognition involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters. 
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: 
•    Testing the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's revenue recognition process including controls over: (i) the identification of distinct performance obligations, and (ii) the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. 
•    Testing a sample of revenue contracts to evaluate management’s identification of distinct performance obligations. 
•    Testing a sample of revenue contracts to evaluate management’s allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Shareholders and Board of Directors 
Appian Corporation
McLean, Virginia
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Appian Corporation’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria
. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
68
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

APPIAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. Organization and Description of Business
Appian Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Appian,” the “Company,” “we,” or “our”) is a software company that orchestrates business processes. The Appian Platform empowers leaders to design, automate, and optimize important processes from start to finish. With our industry-leading platform and commitment to customer success, Appian is trusted by top organizations to drive transformational process change.
We are headquartered in McLean, Virginia and operate both in the U.S. and internationally including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
2. Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) as contained in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”).

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Appian and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although we believe the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates embedded in the consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, income taxes and the related valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets, the amortization period of deferred commissions, the amortization period of the cost to obtain the judgment preservation insurance policy (as discussed in Note 13), lease impairments, and stock-based compensation.
Revenue Recognition
Refer to Note 3 for a detailed discussion on specific revenue recognition principles related to our major revenue streams.
Concentration of Credit and Customer Risk
Our financial instruments exposed to concentration of credit and customer risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and our short-term investments. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits; however, we believe the financial institutions holding our cash deposits are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these balances.
With regard to our customers, credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures are used to minimize the risk of loss.
 Revenue generated from government agencies represented 
32.2
%, 
29.1
%, and 
26.1
% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, of which the top

%, 
35.8
%, and 
33.5
% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, was generated from international customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. As of December 31, 2024, we had one reseller whose balance comprised 
17.5
% of total accounts receivable.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, as well as overnight repurchase agreements, to be cash equivalents. Restricted cash consisted of cash designated to settle an escrow liability stemming from a holdback agreement related to our acquisition of Lana Labs GmbH.
 We paid the remaining amount owed on August 11, 2023.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Expected Credit Losses
Accounts receivable and unbilled revenue are stated at realizable value, net of an allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance is based on our assessment of the collectability of accounts and incorporates an estimation of expected lifetime credit losses on our receivables. We regularly review the composition of the accounts receivable aging, historical bad debts, changes in payment patterns, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and reasonable economic forecasts that affect collectibility. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make required payments, additional provisions for doubtful accounts would be required and would increase bad debt expense.

Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows (in thousands):

Deferred Commissions 
We capitalize costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, which consist of sales commissions paid to our sales team, and the associated incremental payroll taxes. These costs are recorded as deferred commissions in the consolidated balance sheets. Costs to obtain a contract for a new customer or upsell an existing customer are amortized over an estimated economic life of 
five years
 as sales commissions on these types of activities are not commensurate with sales commissions on contract renewals. Commissions paid relating to contract renewals are deferred and amortized over the related renewal period. We determine the estimated economic life based on both qualitative and quantitative factors such as expected renewals, product life cycles, contractual terms, and customer attrition. We periodically review the carrying amount of deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the estimated economic life. Costs to obtain a contract for professional services arrangements are expensed as incurred as the contractual period of our professional services arrangements are one year or less.

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Significant additions or improvements extending the useful life of an asset are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs which do not significantly improve the related assets or extend their useful lives are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally 
3
 years for computer software, computer hardware, and internally developed software, 
5
 years for equipment, and 
10
 years for office furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements have an estimated useful life of the shorter of the useful life of the assets or the lease term.
Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived tangible assets and intangible assets with definite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the assets are written down to their estimated fair value.
Goodwill is accounted for at the segment level and allocated to, and tested for impairment at, a level referred to as the reporting unit. We have determined our 
one
 segment consists of a single reporting unit. We test for impairment annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of our reporting unit may be below its carrying amount. We have the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not the fair value our reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and conclude it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is equal to or greater than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit’s goodwill is necessary; otherwise, goodwill must be tested for impairment.
When performing the quantitative test, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the reporting unit’s goodwill is impaired, and we must recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using a market-based valuation methodology, which is primarily based on our consolidated market capitalization. 
 In 2024, our qualitative assessment concluded the fair value of our reporting unit is more likely than not higher than its carrying value. Therefore, we did not perform a quantitative assessment. 
No
 goodwill impairment was identified in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

APPIAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation expense related to stock-based awards is calculated by determining the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. We calculate the fair value of stock options containing only a service condition using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant. For service-based awards such as RSUs, stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards that contain market conditions, compensation expense is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation and recognized using the accelerated attribution method over the derived service period based on the expected market performance as of the grant date. We account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimating expected forfeitures.

Leases
We combine lease and non-lease components and account for them as a single lease component for our facility leases. The discount rates related to our lease liabilities are based on estimates of our incremental borrowing rate on a secured basis, as the discount rates implicit in our lease agreements cannot be readily determined. 
Basic and Diluted Loss per Common Share
We compute net loss per common share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are substantially identical, other than voting and conversion rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock share equally in our net losses. 
Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed similar to basic, except the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is increased to include additional outstanding shares from the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs, if dilutive. The dilutive effect, if any, of convertible shares is calculated using the treasury stock method. As we reported net losses for all periods presented, all outstanding shares would be considered antidilutive if they were assumed to be vested or exercised.
Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recoverable or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority. We measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. 
We calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. The estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. To the extent the 
78
APPIAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make that determination.
Foreign Currency
Our operations located outside of the United States where the local currency is the functional currency are translated into U.S. dollars using the current rate method. Results of operations are translated at the average rate of exchange for the period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rates on the balance sheet date. Gains and losses on translation of these accounts are accumulated and reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and other comprehensive loss. 
Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a component of ‘Other expense (income), net’.
 Gains and losses from transactions denominated in foreign currencies resulted in net transaction losses of $
16.8
 million, net transaction gains of $
8.7
 million, and net transaction losses of $
6.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Our product utilizes a common codebase, whether accessed by customers via the cloud or via an on-premises installation. Since our software is sold and licensed externally, we consider our software as external-use software for purposes of applying the capitalized software development guidance. Product development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, which is defined as the completion of all planning, designing, coding, and testing activities necessary to establish products that meet design specifications including functions, features, and technical performance requirements. We have determined technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before they are released for sale. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not significant, and accordingly we expense all research and development costs when incurred.

Severance Costs
Severance costs related to benefits provided in accordance with mutually understood and ongoing agreements are recognized when an obligation has been incurred, it is probable the benefits will be paid, and the amount to be paid can be reasonably estimated.
 Severance costs totaled $
5.5
 million and $
6.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
No
 severance costs were incurred related to an involuntary reduction in our workforce for the year ended December 31, 2022. The majority of the severance liability was paid to the impacted employees by December 31, 2024.
Advertising Expenses
We expense advertising costs as they are incurred.
 Advertising expenses were $
3.9
 million, $
4.2
 million, and $
5.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Treasury Stock
We account for treasury stock under the cost method. In 2024, we reissued treasury stock to satisfy employee stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock units as well as for issuances of common stock to our Board of Directors. Because we are in an accumulated deficit position, all reissuances of treasury stock have been recorded as a decrease to additional-paid-in-capital in our consolidated balance sheets.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Adopted
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvement to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which enhances the disclosure requirements for operating segments in our annual and interim consolidated financial statements. The new guidance is effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2024 and for interim period reporting beginning in fiscal year 2025 and will be applied on a retrospective basis. The new ASU requires public companies to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, it requires public companies to disclose the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The ASU does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. This guidance also applies to public entities that have only one segment. This ASU only impacted our disclosures with no impacts to our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Refer to Note 14 for further details.
Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Tax (Topic 740): Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public companies to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified categories with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold. In addition, all entities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign and by jurisdiction if the amount is at least 5% of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. The new guidance will be effective for our annual reporting for fiscal year 2025 on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. This ASU will only impact our disclosures with no impacts to our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
In March 2024, the SEC issued its final climate disclosure rule, which requires the disclosure of material Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-related topics in annual reports if they are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s business. For large accelerated filers, disclosure requirements will begin phasing in for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. Subsequent to issuance, the rules became the subject of litigation, and the SEC has issued a stay to allow the legal process to proceed. We are currently evaluating the impact these rules will have on our financial statements and related disclosures and will monitor the litigation progress for possible impacts on the disclosure requirements under the rules.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires more detailed disclosures of certain categories of expenses such as employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization that are components of existing expense captions presented on the face of the income statement. The new guidance will be effective beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2027 and for interim period reporting beginning in fiscal year 2028. Companies have the option to apply the guidance either on a retrospective or prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial statement presentation and disclosures.

Performance Obligations and Timing of Revenue Recognition
We primarily sell products and services that fall into the categories discussed below. Each category contains one or more performance obligations that are either (1) capable of being distinct (i.e., the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with readily available resources, including those purchased separately from us) and distinct within the context of the contract (i.e., separately identified from other promises in the contract) or (2) a series of distinct products or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Our term license subscriptions are delivered at a point in time while our cloud subscriptions, maintenance and support, and professional services are delivered over time.
Subscriptions Revenue 
Subscriptions revenue is primarily related to (1) cloud subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support and hosting services and (2) term license subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support. We generally charge subscription fees on a per-user basis or through non-user-based single application licenses. We bill customers and collect payment for subscriptions to our platform in advance on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis. In certain instances, our customers have paid their entire contract up front. 
Cloud Subscriptions 
We generate cloud-based subscriptions revenue primarily from the sales of subscriptions to access our cloud offering, together with related support services to our customers. We perform all required maintenance and support for our cloud offering. Revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date the service is made available to the customer. Our cloud-based subscription contracts generally have a term of 
one
 to 
three years
 in length. We bill customers and collect payment for subscriptions to our platform in advance, and they are non-cancellable.
Term License Subscriptions 
Our term license subscriptions revenue is derived from customers with on-premises installations of our platform. The majority of our term license contracts are one year in length. Although term license subscriptions are sold with maintenance and support, the software is fully functional at the beginning of the subscription and is considered a distinct performance obligation. If a cloud-based subscription includes the right for the customer to take possession of the license, the revenue is treated as a term license. Revenue from term license subscriptions is recognized when control of the software license has transferred to the customer, which is the later of delivery or commencement of the contract term. 
Maintenance and Support
Maintenance and support subscriptions include both technical support and when-and-if-available software upgrades, which are treated as a single performance obligation as they are considered a series of distinct services 
81
APPIAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
that are substantially the same and have the same duration and measure of progress. Revenue from maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the contract period, which is the period over which the customer has continuous access to maintenance and support.
Professional Services Revenue
Our professional services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services, including application development and deployment assistance as well as training services related to our platform. Our professional services are considered distinct performance obligations when sold standalone or with other products.
Consulting Services
We sell consulting services to assist customers in planning and executing the deployment of our software. Customers are not required to use consulting services to fully benefit from the software. Consulting services are regularly sold on a standalone basis and most often as either (1) under a fixed-fee arrangement or (2) on a time and materials basis. We also sell advisory services on a subscription basis to support customers or partners with their development and deployment. Consulting services contracts are considered separate performance obligations because they do not integrate with each other or with other products and services to deliver a combined output to the customer, do not modify or customize (or are not modified or customized by) each other or other products and services, and do not affect the customer's ability to use other consulting offerings or other products and services. Revenue under consulting contracts is recognized over time as services are delivered. Revenue from subscription-based consulting contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period. For time and materials-based consulting contracts, we have elected the practical expedient of recognizing revenue upon invoicing since the invoiced amount corresponds directly to the value of our service to date.
Training Services
We sell various training services to our customers. Training services are sold in the form of prepaid training credits that are redeemed based on a fixed rate per course. Training revenue is recognized when the associated training services are delivered.
Significant Judgments and Estimates
Determining the Transaction Price
The transaction price is the total amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the service offerings in a contract and may include both fixed and variable components. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable a significant reversal will not occur. The amount of variable consideration excluded from the transaction price for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was immaterial. Our estimates of variable consideration are also subject to subsequent true-up adjustments and may result in changes to transaction prices; however, such true-up adjustments are not expected to be material.
Allocating the Transaction Price Based on Standalone Selling Prices (“SSP”)
We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in a contract based on its relative SSP. The SSP is the observable price at which we sell the product or service separately. In the absence of observable pricing, we estimate SSP using the residual approach. We establish SSP as follows:
1.
Cloud subscriptions - Given the highly variable selling price of our cloud subscriptions, we establish the SSP of our cloud subscriptions using a residual approach after first determining the SSP of consulting and training services. We have concluded the residual approach to estimating the SSP of our cloud subscriptions is an appropriate allocation of the transaction price.
2.
Term license subscriptions - Given the highly variable selling price of our term license subscriptions, we have established the SSP of term license subscriptions using a residual approach after first determining the SSP of 
82
APPIAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
maintenance and support. Maintenance and support is sold on a standalone basis in conjunction with renewals of our legacy perpetual software licenses and within a narrow range of the net license fee. Because an economic relationship exists between the license and maintenance and support, we have concluded the residual approach to estimating the SSP of term license subscriptions is an appropriate allocation of the transaction price.
3.
Maintenance and support - We establish the SSP of maintenance and support as a percentage of the stated net subscription fee based on observable pricing of maintenance and support renewals from our legacy perpetual software licenses. 
4.
Consulting and training services - The SSP of consulting and training services is established based on the observable pricing of standalone sales within each geographic region where the services are sold. 
Contract Balances
Timing may differ between the satisfaction of performance obligations and the invoicing and collection of amounts related to our contracts with customers. Contract assets primarily relate to unbilled amounts for contracts with customers for which the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when the right to invoice becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations. Deferred revenue is then recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current, and the remaining deferred revenue is recorded as non-current.
The following table sets forth contract asset and contract liability balances as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 (in thousands):

10
 years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Right-of-Use (“ROU”) Assets and Lease Liabilities
At the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present and the classification of the lease. Operating leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as ROU assets, lease liabilities, and long-term lease liabilities. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We have elected not to recognize on our consolidated balance sheets leases with a term of one year or less. 
Lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. The implicit rates within most of our leases are generally not determinable; therefore, we estimate our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments. The determination of our incremental borrowing rate requires judgment and is estimated for each lease based on the rate we would have to pay for a collateralized loan with the same terms as the lease. We consider various factors, including our level of collateralization, estimated credit rating, and the currency in which the lease is denominated. Operating lease ROU assets also include any lease prepayments, offset by lease incentives. Certain of our leases include options to extend or terminate the lease. An option to extend the lease is considered in connection with determining the ROU asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option.
Lease Costs
Expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense. We have lease agreements which require payments for lease and non-lease components (i.e., common area maintenance) that are accounted for as a single lease component. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as maintenance costs, utilities, and service charges are not included in right-of-use (“ROU”) assets or lease liabilities but rather are expensed as incurred and recorded as variable lease expense. We often receive customary incentives from our landlords such as tenant improvement allowances (“TIAs”) and rent abatement periods, which effectively reduce total lease payments owed for the leases.
The following table sets forth the components of lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 (in thousands, exclusive of sublease income):

Lease Impairment Charges 
In connection with headcount reductions approved in June 2024 and our continued efforts to streamline operations and maximize efficiencies, we initiated supplemental actions to reduce the footprint of our leased office spaces. Pursuant to these initiatives, we amended and extended the terms of our existing sublease agreement and are seeking a sublease for an additional floor within our corporate headquarters facility. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded non-cash lease impairment charges of $
5.5
 million within general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. These charges represented the amount the carrying value of 
two
 asset groups, consisting of 
two
 separate floors within our corporate headquarters facility, exceeded their estimated fair values. The fair values of the

 term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $
200.0
 million and, in addition, up to $
100.0
 million for a revolving credit facility, including a letter of credit sub-facility in the aggregate availability amount of $
20.0
 million and a swingline sub-facility in the aggregate availability amount of $
10.0
 million (as a sublimit of the revolving loan facility). The Credit Agreement matures on November 3, 2027. We have been using the proceeds to fund the growth of our business and support our working capital requirements.

APPIAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Under the agreement, we may elect whether amounts drawn bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate per annum equal to either (a) the higher of the Prime rate or the Federal Funds Effective rate (“Base Rate”) plus 
0.5
% or (b) the forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (“Term SOFR”). An additional interest rate margin is added to the elected interest rates. During the first three years of the Credit Agreement, the additional interest rate margin ranges from 
1.5
% to 
2.5
% in the case of Base Rate advances or from 
2.5
% to 
3.5
% in the case of Term SOFR advances, depending on our debt to recurring revenue leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). During the final two years of the Credit Agreement, the interest rate margin ranges from 
0.5
% to 
2.5
% in the case of Base Rate advances and from 
1.5
% to 
3.5
% in the case of Term SOFR advances, depending on our debt to consolidated adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). 
In addition, the Credit Agreement contains other customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including covenants by us limiting additional indebtedness, guarantees, liens, fundamental changes, mergers and consolidations, dispositions of assets, investments, paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring capital stock, prepaying certain junior indebtedness and preferred stock, certain corporate changes, and transactions with affiliates. The Credit Agreement also provides for customary events of default, including but not limited to non-payment, breaches, or defaults in the performance of covenants, insolvency, bankruptcy, and the occurrence of a material adverse effect on us.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $
287.5
 million and $
295.9
 million, respectively, of gross net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for U.S. federal tax purposes. U.S. federal NOL carryforwards in the gross amount of $
16.6
 million and generated prior to 2018 will expire, if unused, in 2037. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”), as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), federal NOL carryforwards generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2024, we had $
270.9
 million of gross NOL carryforwards generated after 2017 for U.S. federal tax purposes, which may be used to offset 80% of our taxable income annually.
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code limits the utilization of NOL carryforwards when ownership changes occur, as defined by that section. A number of states have similar state laws that limit utilization of state NOL carryforwards when ownership changes occur. We have performed an analysis of our Section 382 ownership changes and have determined all U.S. federal and state NOL carryforwards are available for use as of December 31, 2024. 
Beginning in 2022, the TCJA eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires companies to amortize such expenditures over five or fifteen years for tax purposes, depending on whether the activities were incurred in the U.S. or outside of the U.S. The new research and development expenditures rules resulted in a tax-effected deferred tax asset (before valuation allowance) of approximately $
45.8
 million and $
35.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Due 
91
APPIAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
to the full valuation allowance recorded against our U.S. deferred tax assets, there was no impact to net deferred tax assets. Additionally, there was no cash tax impact for 2024 due to our ability to use NOL carryforwards to fully offset taxable income generated by the changes to research and development expenditures.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $
32.5
 million and $
27.2
 million, respectively, of U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards which will expire, if unused, between 2031 and 2044.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had U.S. gross state NOL carryforwards of $
297.5
 million and $
306.8
 million, respectively. We had tax-effected state NOL carryforwards of $
17.8
 million and $
17.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The rules regarding carryforwards vary from state to state, and the ability to utilize NOLs varies based on timing and amount. The majority of state NOL carryforwards generated prior to 2018 will expire, if unused, in 2037. Due to the TCJA, certain state NOL carryforwards generated after 2017 have an indefinite carryforward period.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had foreign gross NOL carryforwards of $
230.1
 million and $
192.3
 million, respectively, primarily attributable to our subsidiary in Switzerland. We had tax-effected foreign NOL carryforwards of $
29.0
 million and $
21.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In 2024, $
1.0
 million of tax-effected Swiss NOLs expired related to the 2017 tax year. An additional portion of those NOL carryforwards will expire each year, if unused, between 2025 and 2031. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 we had a total valuation allowance of $
188.0
 million and $
162.0
 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024, we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets based on our cumulative operating results as of December 31, 2024, three-year cumulative loss, and an assessment of our expected future results of operations. We have evaluated all evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the likelihood of realizability, and we determined the negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence.
As of December 31, 2024, we have a valuation allowance of $
26.2
 million against foreign deferred tax assets at our subsidiary in Switzerland. Based on our cumulative operating results as of December 31, 2024 and assessment of our expected future results of operations, we determined it was not more likely than not we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets prior to expiration. 
We plan to distribute previously undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries back to the United States in future years. Upon repatriation of those earnings, if any, we may be subject to taxes, including withholding taxes, net of any applicable foreign tax credits. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable.

We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Our uncertain tax positions primarily relate to federal research and development tax credits. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized nominal amounts in interest. The cumulative balances of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were immaterial. We anticipate total unrecognized tax benefits will not decrease over the next year. 
We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. Due to the NOL carryforward, tax years 2016 through 2024 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject. There are no open examinations that would have a meaningful impact to our consolidated financial statements.
10. Stock-Based Compensation
Equity Incentive Plans
In May 2017, our Board of Directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”). The 2017 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to employees and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock appreciation rights, performance-based stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation to employees, including officers, non-employee directors, and consultants. We initially reserved 
6,421,442
 shares of Class A common stock for issuance under the 2017 Plan, which included 
421,442
 shares that remained available for issuance under our 2007 Stock Option Plan (the “2007 Plan”) at the time the 2017 Plan became effective. The number of shares reserved under the 2017 Plan increases for any shares subject to outstanding awards originally granted under the 2007 Plan that expire or are forfeited prior to exercise. As a result of the adoption of the 2017 Plan, 
no
 further grants may be made under the 2007 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
7,196,533
 shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2017 Plan, of which 
2,009,200
 are still available to be issued.

Stock Options
In June 2022, our Board of Directors granted a stock option to purchase 
700,000
 shares of our Class A common stock to our Chief Executive Officer (the “2022 CEO Grant”) under the 2017 Plan with an exercise price of $
50.63
 per share. The 2022 CEO Grant is eligible to vest based on the achievement of various stock price appreciation targets of our Class A common stock. Specifically, the 2022 CEO Grant vests in 
four
 installments of 
25
% each if the average closing price per share for a 365 day calendar period equals or exceeds each of $
175
, $
200
, $
225
, and $
250
, respectively (the “Vesting Price Threshold”), prior to June 7, 2030. The option also vests if the Company engages in a Corporate Transaction, as defined in the Plan, in which the Company’s Class A common stock is valued at or above the Vesting Price Threshold. The fair value of the 2022 CEO Grant was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of the award at the grant date was $
18.8
 million and is being amortized over derived service periods ranging from 
3.4
 years to 
4.1
 years.
The only stock option awarded during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was the 2022 CEO Grant. 
The following table summarizes the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the 2022 CEO stock option grant:

 shares of Class A common stock and 
100,000,000
 shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $
0.0001

42,938,701
 issued and outstanding while our shares of Class B common stock, which are not publicly traded, totaled

one
 vote per share, and the holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 
ten
 votes per share on all matters subject to stockholder vote. The holders of Class B common stock also have approval rights for certain corporate actions. Each share of Class B common stock may be converted into 
one
 share of Class A common stock at the option of its holder and will be automatically converted upon transfer thereof, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, upon the date on which the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represent less than

Minimum Purchase Commitments
We have a non-cancellable cloud hosting arrangement with Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) that contains provisions for minimum purchase commitments. Specifically, purchase commitments under the agreement total $
220.0
 million over 
five years
. The agreement, which was originated in July 2021 and amended in October 2024, currently contains minimum annual spending requirements of $
44.0
 million from November 2024 to October 2029. Spending under this agreement for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 totaled $
41.2
 million, $
36.6
 million, and $
33.1
 million, respectively. The timing of payments under the agreement may vary. We expect to meet our minimum annual spending requirement during the term of the arrangement. 
97
APPIAN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Exclusive of the AWS contract, we have other non-cancellable agreements for subscription software products that contain provisions stipulating minimum purchase commitments. However, the annual purchase commitments under these contracts are, individually and in the aggregate, immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
Pegasystems Litigation
On May 29, 2020, we filed a civil complaint against Pegasystems, Inc. (“Pegasystems”) and Youyong Zou, a Virginia resident, in the Circuit Court for Fairfax County, Virginia. 
Appian Corp v. Pegasystems Inc. & Youyong Zou, No. 2020-07216 (Fairfax Cty. Ct.)
. On May 10, 2022, we announced the jury awarded us $
2.036
 billion in damages for misappropriation of our trade secrets and $
1
 in damages for violating the Virginia Computer Crimes Act. Pegasystems filed several post-trial motions seeking relief in the form of reducing the damages award or setting aside the jury’s verdict and either granting a new trial or entering judgment in Pegasystems’ favor. All of these motions were denied, and final judgment was entered by the Court on September 15, 2022. The final judgment reaffirmed the $
2.036
 billion in damages and also ordered Pegasystems to pay Appian $
23.6
 million in attorney's fees associated with the case as well as statutory post-judgment interest on the judgment at an annual rate of 
6
%, or approximately $
122.0
 million per year.
Defendant Youyong Zou has satisfied the judgment of $
5,000
 (plus interest) against him in lieu of appealing that judgment. On September 15, 2022, Pegasystems filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals of Virginia. On July 30, 2024, the Court of Appeals of Virginia issued a decision reversing the judgment against Pegasystems and remanding for a new trial. The decision rejected Pegasystems’ argument that Appian had not presented evidence that trade secrets were misappropriated but reversed the judgment on the basis of evidentiary and damages rulings made by the trial court. On August 29, 2024, Appian submitted a petition to the Supreme Court of Virginia seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals decision and reinstate the full judgment against Pegasystems. Pegasystems filed an opposition to the petition and cross-issues for appeal on October 21, 2024. Appian's petition was heard on February 11, 2025. The timeline for rendering a decision is solely in the control of the Supreme Court. 
We cannot predict the outcome of any appeals or the exact time it will take to resolve them.
Judgment Preservation Insurance
On September 1, 2023, we entered into a Judgment Preservation Insurance (“JPI”) policy in connection with our $
2.036
 billion judgment against Pegasystems. The total cost of the policy was $
57.3
 million and is comprised of the premium, a one-time broker fee, and Virginia lines tax. The policy provides up to $
500.0
 million of coverage. 
The total cost of the policy was capitalized and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated length of the appeals process. We currently estimate the total length of the appeals process (solely for amortization purposes) to be approximately 
four years
. This estimate is reviewed each reporting period. Amortization expense associated with the JPI premium is recorded to general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. JPI amortization expense was $
15.8
 million and $
6.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, $
12.5
 million of the unamortized balance is classified as ‘Prepaid expenses and other current assets’ while the remaining $
22.9
 million is classified as ‘Other assets’ on our consolidated balance sheets. 
Other Legal Matters
From time to time, we are subject to legal, regulatory, and other proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report, we are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.

Share Repurchase Program
In February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $
50.0
 million of our common stock from March 2024 to February 2026. In March 2024, we repurchased 
1.3
 million shares under this program at an average share price of $
37.86

50.0
 million. As of December 31, 2024, shareholders’ equity included 
74.0
 million shares outstanding, and all treasury shares were reissued.
14. Segment and Geographic Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. We have determined our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer.
We have 
one
 operating and 
one
 reportable segment, representing our consolidated business that helps organizations design, automate, and optimize important business processes from start to finish. We generate revenue from customers primarily through the sale of cloud and term subscriptions bundled with maintenance and support as well as professional services revenue from fees for our consulting services and training related to our platform. Our reportable segment determination is based on our management and internal reporting structure, the nature of the subscriptions and services we offer, and the financial information evaluated regularly by our CODM.
The CODM uses operating loss and net loss reported on the consolidated statements of operations to assess performance for the segment and decide how to allocate resources. In addition, the CODM reviews the expense categories presented on the consolidated statements of operations to manage the Company’s operations. Operating loss and net loss are used to evaluate profitability trends in the business, and the CODM considers budget-to-actual variances for both profit measures when making decisions about allocating capital and resources. Further, the measure of segment assets is total assets as reported on the consolidated balance sheets.
The following table summarizes revenue by geography for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 (in thousands):

15. Retirement Plans
We have a defined contribution 401(k) retirement and savings plan (the “Plan”) to provide retirement benefits for all eligible employees. With limited exceptions, all employees over the age of 21 on the first day of the month immediately following the month of hiring are eligible to participate in the Plan. The Plan allows eligible employees to make salary-deferred contributions up to 
75
% of their pre-tax annual compensation, as defined in the Plan, as long as the total contributed does not exceed the annual maximum allowable amount under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company makes a semi-monthly matching contribution of 
100
% of the employee's contribution for that pay period, up to a maximum of 
4
% of the employee's eligible gross compensation for that pay period. Company contributions vest ratably based on years of service over a 
four year
 period, beginning with the completion of the first year of service. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we incurred $
12.8
 million, $
12.9
 million, and $
11.5
 million, respectively, in contribution expense related to employer matching contributions.

16. Investments and Fair Value Measurements
Fair Value Measurements
U.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. The hierarchy requires us to use observable inputs when available and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. The three tiers are defined as follows:
•
Level 1 - 
Observable inputs based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•
Level 2 - 
Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
•
Level 3 - 
Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, and which require us to develop our own estimates and assumptions reflecting those that a market participant would use.
The asset or liability’s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There were no instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: 
•
Market approach -
 Uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities; 
•
Income approach - 
Uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations about those future amounts; and
•
Cost approach -
 Based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (i.e., replacement cost).
The carrying amounts of our accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 because of the relatively short duration of these instruments. Additionally, the carrying value of our debt associated with the term loan facility approximates fair value because the interest rates are variable and reset on relatively short durations to then-market rates.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Interim Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The Annual Report on Form 10-K includes an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, believes our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system 
102
of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
