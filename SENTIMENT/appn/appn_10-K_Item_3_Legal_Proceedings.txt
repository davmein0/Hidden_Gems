Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
Pegasystems Litigation
On May 29, 2020, we filed a civil complaint against Pegasystems, Inc. (“Pegasystems”) and Youyong Zou, a Virginia resident, in the Circuit Court for Fairfax County, Virginia. 
Appian Corp v. Pegasystems Inc. & Youyong Zou, No. 2020-07216 (Fairfax Cty. Ct.)
. On May 10, 2022, we announced the jury awarded us $2.036 billion in damages for misappropriation of our trade secrets and $1 in damages for violating the Virginia Computer Crimes Act. Pegasystems filed several post-trial motions seeking relief in the form of reducing the damages award or setting aside the jury’s verdict and either granting a new trial or entering judgment in Pegasystems’ favor. All of these motions were denied, and final judgment was entered by the Court on September 15, 2022. The final judgment reaffirmed the $2.036 billion in damages and also ordered Pegasystems to pay Appian $23.6 million in attorney's fees associated with the case as well as statutory post-judgment interest on the judgment at an annual rate of 6%, or approximately $122.0 million per year. 
Defendant Youyong Zou has satisfied the judgment of $5,000 (plus interest) against him in lieu of appealing that judgment. On September 15, 2022, Pegasystems filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals of Virginia. On July 30, 2024, the Court of Appeals of Virginia issued a decision reversing the judgment against Pegasystems and remanding for a new trial. The decision rejected Pegasystems’ argument that Appian had not presented evidence that trade secrets were misappropriated but reversed the judgment on the basis of evidentiary and damages rulings made by the trial court. On August 29, 2024, Appian submitted a petition to the Supreme Court of Virginia seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals decision and reinstate the full judgment against Pegasystems. Pegasystems filed an opposition to the petition and cross-issues for appeal on October 21, 2024. Appian's petition was heard on February 11, 2025. The timeline for rendering a decision is solely in the control of the Supreme Court. 
Other Matters
From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Other than as disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management time and resources, and other factors.

Market Information
Our Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “APPN.” Our Class B common stock is not listed or traded on any stock exchange.
As of February 17, 2025, there were 16 holders of record of our Class A common stock and 29 holders of record of our Class B common stock. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
Dividends
We have never declared or paid as a public company, and do not anticipate declaring or paying in the foreseeable future, any cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends or share repurchase program, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to applicable laws, and depend on then existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions pursuant to our outstanding Credit Agreement, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

Shares purchased represent shares purchased on the open market pursuant to the Appian Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, which was approved by the Company’s stockholders on June 11, 2021. The ESPP provides employees with an opportunity to purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions and provides for a Company match of 5% to 15%, subject to limits set forth in the ESPP. Shares purchased under the ESPP are deposited into the participants’ accounts.
(2) 
Because the number of shares that may be purchased under the ESPP depends on each employee’s voluntary election to participate, individual contribution elections, and the fair market value of our Class A common stock at various future dates, the actual number of shares that may be purchased under the plan cannot be determined in advance. We have filed a registration statement on S-8 that covers 1,000,000 shares.
