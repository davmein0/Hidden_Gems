Item 5.
Market For Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Holders of the Company's common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters presented to shareholders for their vote, as provided in our Articles of Incorporation, as amended.
The Company's common stock is traded under the symbol “SBCF” on the NASDAQ. As of January 31, 2025, there were 85,612,136 shares of the Company's common stock outstanding, held by approximately 2,330 record holders.
Dividends from Seacoast Bank are the Company's primary source of funds to pay dividends to its shareholders. Under the National Bank Act, national banks may in any calendar year, without the approval of the OCC, pay dividends to the extent of net profits for that year, plus retained net profits for the preceding two years (less any required transfers to surplus). The need for Seacoast Bank to maintain adequate capital also limits dividends that may be paid to the Company.
