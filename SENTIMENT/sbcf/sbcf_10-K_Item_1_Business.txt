Item 1. Business”).
The OCC and the FRB have policies that encourage banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends from current earnings, and have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by national banks and bank holding companies, respectively, if such payment may be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. If, in the particular circumstances, either of these federal regulators determined that the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice, either the OCC or the FRB may, among other things, issue a cease and desist order prohibiting the payment of dividends by Seacoast Bank or us, respectively. The Board of Directors of a bank holding company must consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level, if any, is prudent relative to the organization’s financial position and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios such as any potential events that may occur before the payment date that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the FRB has indicated that the Board of Directors of a bank holding company, such as Seacoast, should consult with the FRB and eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if: (i) its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
The Company has paid quarterly dividends since the second quarter of 2021. Whether the Company continues to pay quarterly dividends and the amount of any such dividends will be at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend on the Company's earnings, financial condition, results of operations, business prospects, capital requirements, regulatory restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.
The Company has seven wholly owned trust subsidiaries that have issued trust preferred stock. Trust preferred securities from acquisitions were recorded at fair value when acquired. All trust preferred securities are guaranteed by the Company on a junior subordinated basis. The FRB’s rules permit qualified trust preferred securities and other restricted capital elements to be included under Basel III capital guidelines, with limitations, and net of goodwill and intangibles. The Company believes that its trust preferred securities qualify under these revised regulatory capital rules and believes that it can treat all its trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital. For regulatory purposes, the trust preferred securities are added to the Company’s tangible common shareholders’ equity to calculate Tier 1 capital.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, including prevailing practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments in the application of certain of its accounting policies that involve significant estimates and assumptions. The Company has established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. These estimates and assumptions, which may materially affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information over time and the use of revised estimates and assumptions could materially affect amounts reported in subsequent financial statements. Management, after consultation with the Company’s Audit Committee, believes the most critical accounting estimates and assumptions that involve the most difficult, subjective and complex assessments are: 
•
the allowance and the provision for credit losses;
•
acquisition accounting and purchased loans;
•
intangible assets and impairment testing, and;
•
fair value of financial instruments 
The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies intended to facilitate a reader’s understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies and the possible or likely events or uncertainties known to the Company that could have a material effect on reported financial information. For more information regarding management’s 
55
judgments relating to significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements, see “Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Allowance for Credit Losses 
The Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL) represents management’s best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ACL requires significant judgment and is based on a variety of factors. Management establishes the allowance using relevant available information from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Economic forecast data is sourced from Moody’s Analytics, a firm widely recognized for its research, analysis, and economic forecasts. The forecast may utilize one scenario or a composite of scenarios based on management's judgment and expectations around the current and future macroeconomic outlook. The forecasts of future economic conditions are over a period that has been deemed reasonable and supportable, and in segments where it can no longer develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to longer-term historical loss experience to estimate losses over the remaining life of the loans. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments.
One of the most significant judgments in estimating the Allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts. As of December 31, 2024, the Company utilized a blend of Moody’s most recent “U.S. Macroeconomic Outlook Baseline” (Baseline), “Alternative Scenario 1 – Upside- 10th Percentile” (S1), and “Alternative Scenario 3 - Downside - 90th Percentile” (S3) scenarios. The weighting applied in the December 31, 2024 analysis reflects an improvement in the economic outlook as compared to December 31, 2023, and considers the anticipated actions taken by the FRB with regard to monetary policy and interest rates and the potential impact of those actions. The forecasted credit losses incorporate numerous macroeconomic variables, although specific variables have a greater impact on the outcome than others. Specifically, changes in expectations indicated by the Commercial Real Estate Price Index have the most significant impact on the estimate of expected losses for commercial real estate non-owner-occupied loans and construction and land development loans, the housing price index is the economic forecast variable most significantly impacting the estimate of expected losses for residential loans, and the unemployment rate is a significant contributor to commercial and consumer loans. 
Management considers a range of macroeconomic forecast data in connection with the allowance estimation process. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in the allowance estimate. Changes in the factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. Under the range of scenarios considered as of December 31, 2024, use of solely Moody’s S3 downside scenario would have resulted in an increase to the modeled allowance results of approximately $66 million or 66 basis points. This estimate reflects the sensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate to macroeconomic forecast data but does not consider other qualitative adjustments that could increase or decrease modeled loss estimates calculated using this alternative economic scenario.
Seacoast conducted an additional sensitivity by increasing loss sensitivities by 5% and 10% to each of the loan pools. Estimated credit losses increased by $6 million and $11 million, respectively, from the probability weighted model outcomes, but does not consider other qualitative adjustments that could increase or decrease modeled loss estimates. Changes in the loss assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect the Company’s estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.
Qualitative adjustments may be made to modeled reserves based on an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality not fully reflected in the quantitative components of the allowance model. These influences may include elements such as changes in concentration, macroeconomic conditions, recent observable asset quality trends, staff turnover, regional market conditions, employment levels, model risk, and loan growth. 
For additional information regarding the Company's methodology for calculating the Allowance for Credit Losses, see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – Allowance for Credit Losses in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Acquisition Accounting and Purchased Loans 
The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. All loans acquired are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurement
. The fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of expected principal, interest and other cash flows. Loans are identified as PCD when they have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. An 
56
allowance for expected credit losses on PCD loans is recorded at the date of acquisition through an adjustment to the loans’ amortized cost basis. In contrast, expected credit losses on loans not considered PCD are recognized through the provision for credit losses at the date of acquisition. 
The non-credit discount or premium related to PCD loans and the fair value adjustment on non-PCD loans are amortized or accreted to Interest and fees on loans over the contractual life of the loans using the effective interest method. In the event of prepayment, unamortized discounts or premiums are recognized in Interest and fees on loans.
Fair value estimates for acquired assets and assumed liabilities are based on the information available, and are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information relative to closing date fair values becomes available.
Intangible Assets and Impairment Testing 
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions. The core deposit intangible, which is the majority of the remaining intangible asset balance, represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships. Core deposit intangibles are amortized using an amortization method that reflects the expected value over time, and are evaluated for indications of potential impairment at least annually. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. We performed an annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2024 and concluded that no impairment existed.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
AFS securities
AFS securities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on market quotations when available or, if not available, by using quoted market prices for similar securities, pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses, using observable market data where available. The fair value of AFS securities is based upon pricing obtained from third party pricing services. Based on internal review procedures and the fair values provided by the pricing services, the Company believes that the fair values provided by the pricing services are consistent with the principles of ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measuremen
t. On occasion, pricing provided by the pricing services may not be consistent with other observed prices in the market for similar securities. Using observable market factors, including interest rate and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities and default rates, the Company may at times validate the observed prices using a discounted cash flow model and using the observed prices for similar securities to determine the fair value of its securities. 
Seacoast analyzes AFS debt securities quarterly for credit losses utilizing both quantitative and qualitative assessments to determine if a security has a credit loss. Quantitative assessments are based on a discounted cash flow method. Qualitative assessments consider a range of factors including: rating downgrades, subordination, amortized loan-to-value, and the ability of the issuers to pay all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms.
For AFS securities, if any portion of the decline in fair value is related to credit, the amount of allowance is determined as the portion related to credit, limited to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security. If the Company has the intent to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell an impaired AFS security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the credit loss is recorded as a direct write-down of the amortized cost basis. Declines in the fair value of AFS securities that are not considered credit related are recognized in "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Derivatives 
The Company enters into derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, to meet the needs of customers who request such services and to manage the Company's interest rate risk. The fair value of these derivatives is based on a discounted cash flow approach and is based upon the estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate the instruments, taking into account current interest rates and, when appropriate, the current credit worthiness of the counterparties. For additional information regarding the Company's derivatives see Note 6 – Derivatives.

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Sensitivity
Fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments, cash flows and net interest income. This risk is managed using simulation modeling to calculate the most likely interest rate risk utilizing estimated loan and deposit growth. The objective is to optimize the Company’s financial position, liquidity, and net interest income while limiting volatility.
Senior management regularly reviews the overall interest rate risk position and evaluates strategies to manage the risk. The Company's ALCO uses simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates. The simulation of rising, declining and flat interest rate scenarios allows management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to assess the impact of market interest rate swings. The analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve- month period is subjected to instantaneous changes in market rates and is monitored at least quarterly. 
The following table presents the ALCO simulation model's projected impact of a change in interest rates on the projected baseline net interest income for the 12 and 24 month periods beginning on January 1, 2025, holding all balances on the balance sheet static. It is important to note that the results in the table below assume parallel shifts in the yield curve and do not take into account changes in the slope of the yield curve nor changes in balance sheet size or mix.

The computations of interest rate risk do not necessarily include certain actions management may undertake to manage this risk in response to changes in interest rates. Management may adjust asset or liability pricing or structure in order to manage interest rate risk through an interest rate cycle. This may include the use of investment portfolio purchases or sales or the use of derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, options, caps, floors, futures or forward contracts.
The Company's calculation of interest rate sensitivity for the year ended December 31, 2024 is presented below. The balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are presented in the periods in which they reprice to market rates or mature. The amounts are aggregated to reflect the interest rate sensitivity gap. This analysis includes assumptions for prepayments of loans and securities and assumptions for core deposit re-pricing. 
The computations of interest rate sensitivity are based on the static balance sheet and do not necessarily include certain actions management may undertake to manage this risk in response to changes in interest rates in the future. This may include specific efforts to change the size of the balance sheet or the relative composition of fixed versus variable rate assets and liabilities as well as qualitative changes that could impact quantitative performance.

Market Risk
Market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, and other relevant market rates or prices.
Interest rate risk, defined as the exposure of net interest income and EVE to adverse movements in interest rates, is the Company’s primary market risk, and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet (non-trading activities). The Company is also exposed to market risk in its investing activities. The ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the Company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk. The policies established by the ALCO are reviewed and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk, within policy limits approved by the Board of Directors. These limits reflect the Company’s tolerance for interest rate risk over short-term and long-term horizons.
The Company also performs valuation analyses, which are used for evaluating levels of risk present in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analyses. Whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows, the net result of which is the EVE. The sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer-term re-pricing risks and options risks embedded in the balance sheet. In contrast to the net interest income simulation, which assumes interest rates will change over a period of time, EVE uses instantaneous changes in rates.
EVE values only the current balance sheet, and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model. As with the net interest income simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate life deposit portfolios. Core deposits are a more significant funding source for the Company, making the lives attached to core deposits more important to the accuracy of our modeling of EVE. The Company periodically reassesses its assumptions regarding the indeterminate lives of core deposits utilizing an independent third-party resource to assist.

The following table presents the projected impact of a change in interest rates on the balance sheet. This change in interest rates assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve and does not take into account changes in the slope of the yield curve.

While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis, a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon, i.e., the next fiscal year. Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, change in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates.
Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices
The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money, over time, due to inflation.
Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than the general level of inflation. However, inflation affects financial institutions by increasing their cost of goods and services purchased, as well as the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense, and similar items. Inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings, and shareholders’ equity. Mortgage origination and refinancing tends to slow as interest rates increase, and higher interest rates will likely reduce the Company’s earnings from such activities and the income from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida
Stuart, Florida 
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.   
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
64
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses on Loans
The allowance for credit losses (the “ACL”) is an accounting estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of loans carried at amortized cost as described in Notes 1 and 5 of the consolidated financial statements. 
The Company's loan portfolio, which is 
measured at amortized cost, is required to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. 
Estimates of expected credit losses for loans are based on information from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
The Company estimates expected credit losses for loans at the individual loan level using a discounted cash flow methodology for its commercial loans and using a loss rate methodology for its consumer loans.  Expected losses are estimated using a blend of forecast scenarios. Specifically, the forecast scenarios selected were the “U.S.  Macroeconomic Outlook Baseline”, "Alternative Scenario 1 - Upside - 10th Percentile" and "Alternative Scenario 3 - Downside - 90th Percentile” scenarios. The forecasted credit losses also incorporate macroeconomic variables such as changes in expectations indicated by the commercial real estate price index, changes in the housing price index, and changes in the unemployment rate. 
The forecasts of future 
economic conditions are over a period that the Company has deemed reasonable and supportable, and in segments where it can no longer develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to longer-term historical loss experience to estimate losses over the remaining life of the loans. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments
.

The Company may incorporate qualitative adjustments to modeled reserves based on an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality not fully reflected in the quantitative components of the allowance model. These influences may include elements such as changes in concentration, macroeconomic conditions, recent observable asset quality trends, staff turnover, regional market conditions, employment levels, model risk, and loan growth.
A significant amount of judgment was required when assessing the conceptual design and statistical methodology of the employed model and whether the model was relevant to the Company’s loan portfolio and suitable for use in the Company’s estimation process, which in turn involved especially complex and subjective judgment. The Company’s discounted cash flow methodology includes probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) assumptions that required assessing the conceptual soundness and reasonableness of those assumptions. We utilized Crowe LLP employed valuation specialists (“Crowe VS”) to evaluate the soundness of the model’s methodology, conceptual design, and applicability to the Company. Crowe VS also performed procedures to assess the relationships between the Company’s PD and LGD rates and model rates.
The principal considerations resulting in our determination included the following:
•
Significant auditor judgment in evaluating the selection and application of the reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic variables and reasonableness of other model assumptions, including the need to involve Crowe VS. 
•
Significant auditor effort in evaluating probability-weighted forecast scenarios with PD and LGD assumptions that involved the use of management judgment and a high degree of auditor judgment
.
•
Significant audit effort related to testing the completeness and accuracy of internal data used and evaluating the relevance and reliability of proxy loan information.
The primary procedures performed to address the critical audit matter included:
•
Testing the effectiveness of controls over the completeness and accuracy of internal data inputs, including loan segmentation data used in the development of PD and LGD assumptions, and the relevance and reliability of third-party data used in the computation.
•
Testing the effectiveness of management’s internal controls over the Company’s significant model methods, assumptions and judgments, including qualitative adjustments and information systems.
65
•
Testing the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s preparation and review of the allowance for credit losses calculation, including the reasonableness of management's judgments over the economic scenarios selected and weightings applied. 
•
With the assistance of Crowe VS, evaluating the relevance and reliability of third-party data used in management’s methodology. 
•
Substantively testing the completeness and accuracy of internal loan level data used, loan segmentation, the relevance and reliability of third-party data used for qualitative factors, and management’s judgments and assumptions for reasonableness.
•
Substantive univariate directionality testing with the assistance of Crowe VS and other substantive analytical procedures to test significant assumptions made by management and testing the process of management’s assessment for the incorporation of qualitative adjustments.
•
Evaluating management’s judgments in the selection and application of reasonable and supportable forecasts, and the reasonableness of forecasted economic scenarios provided by a third-party, assisted by Crowe VS.

TATEMENTS
Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida and Subsidiaries
Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies
General:
 Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida (“Seacoast” or the “Company”) is a financial holding company with 
one
 operating subsidiary bank, Seacoast National Bank (“Seacoast Bank”). The Company provides integrated financial services including commercial and consumer banking, wealth management, and mortgage and insurance services to customers at 
77
 full-service branches across Florida, and through advanced mobile and online banking solutions.
See the Glossary of Defined Terms at the beginning of this Report for terms used herein.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Seacoast and all its majority-owned subsidiaries but exclude trusts created for the issuance of trust preferred securities. In consolidation, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and they conform to general practices within the applicable industries. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Use of Estimates:
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments in the application of certain accounting policies that involve significant estimates and assumptions. The Company has established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period. These estimates and assumptions, which may materially affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements, and changes in this information over time and the use of revised estimates and assumptions could materially affect amounts reported in subsequent financial statements. Specific areas, among others, requiring the application of management’s estimates include the determination of the allowance for credit losses, acquisition accounting and purchased loans, intangible assets and impairment testing, and other fair value measurements
.
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and interest-bearing bank balances. Cash equivalents have original maturities of three months or less, and accordingly, the carrying amount of these instruments is deemed to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Time Deposits with Other Banks:
 Time deposits with other banks consist of certificates of deposit with original maturities greater than three months and are carried at cost.
Securities Purchased and Sold Agreements:
 Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are generally accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amount at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. It is the Company’s policy to take possession of securities purchased under resale agreements, which are primarily U.S. government and government agency securities. The fair value of securities purchased and sold is monitored and collateral is obtained from or returned to the counterparty when appropriate.

Securities:
 Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Debt securities available-for-sale may be sold as part of the Company's asset/liability management or in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk, or for other factors, and are stated at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses are reflected as a component of shareholders' equity net of tax or included in noninterest income as appropriate. Debt securities held-to-maturity that the Company has the ability and intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are considered marketable and measured at fair value with unrealized gains or losses included in noninterest income as securities gains or losses. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are considered non-marketable and are accounted for at cost under the measurement alternative to fair value, with adjustments for impairment and observable price changes if applicable. 
The estimated fair value of a security is determined based on market quotations when available or, if not available, by using quoted market prices for similar securities, pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses, using observable market data where available.
Realized gains and losses are included in noninterest income as investment securities gains (losses). Interest and dividends on securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on debt securities, is recognized in interest income on 
75
an accrual basis using the interest method. The Company anticipates prepayments of principal in the calculation of the effective yield for collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities by obtaining estimates of prepayments from independent third parties. The adjusted cost of each specific security sold is used to compute realized gains or losses on the sale of securities on a trade date basis.
Credit losses on securities: 
For securities classified as HTM, management estimates expected credit losses over the remaining expected life and recognizes this estimate as an allowance for credit losses. Debt securities that are available-for-sale are considered impaired if the fair value is less than amortized cost. Impairments are analyzed at an individual security level on a quarterly basis and both quantitative and qualitative assessments are utilized to determine if a security has a credit loss. Qualitative assessments consider a range of factors including: percent decline in fair value, rating downgrades, subordination, duration, amortized loan-to-value, and the ability of the issuers to pay all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms. Quantitative assessments are based on a discounted cash flow analysis, which includes evaluating the timing and amount of the expected cash flows. If any portion of the decline in fair value is related to credit, then the credit loss is recognized as an allowance for credit loss and the noncredit portion is recognized in other comprehensive income. 
Loans Held for Sale:
 The Company has elected to account for residential mortgage loans originated as held for sale at fair value. Changes in fair value are measured and recorded in Mortgage Banking Fees in noninterest income each period. The Company designates other loans as held for sale when it has the intent to sell them. These loans are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value on an individual basis. When such loans are transferred to held for sale, any previously recorded allowance for credit losses is reversed into earnings and the loan is recorded at its amortized cost basis. Prior to the transfer, write-downs on the loans are recorded as charge-offs, establishing a new cost basis upon transfer.
Loans Held for Investment:
 Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are considered held for investment. Loans originated by Seacoast and held for investment are recognized at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income and amounts charged off. Unearned income includes discounts, premiums and deferred loan origination fees reduced by loan origination costs. Unearned income on loans is amortized to interest income over the life of the related loan using the effective interest rate method. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis.
Loans acquired through business acquisitions are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. Loans that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are classified as PCD. Acquired loans that do not meet the definition of PCD are classified by the Company as acquired Non-PCD. Expected credit losses on loans not considered PCD are recognized through the provision for credit losses when the initial allowance is recorded.
A loan for which the terms have been modified with principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay or a term extension and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, is considered to be a TBM.

Allowance for credit losses on loans: 
The allowance for credit losses represents management's best estimate of expected credit losses related to the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount to be collected on loans. Loan balances deemed uncollectible are charged off against the allowance for credit losses and recoveries are credited to the allowance. In order to adjust the allowance to the current estimate of expected credit losses, charges or credits to the provision for credit losses are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company excludes accrued interest on loans from its determination of allowance as such amounts are generally reversed against interest income when a loan is placed in nonperforming status. 
Portfolio segments represent the level at which the Company develops and documents its methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses. See "Note 4 - Loans," for a description of each of the segments, which are disaggregated by similar risk characteristics such as customer and/or collateral type.
The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Management establishes the allowance using relevant available information from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Economic forecast data is sourced from Moody’s, a firm recognized for its research, analysis, and economic forecasts. The forecasts of future economic conditions are over a period that has been deemed reasonable and supportable, and in segments where it can no longer develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to longer-term historical loss experience to estimate losses over the remaining life of the loans. The forecast may utilize one scenario or a composite of scenarios based on management's judgment and expectations around the current and future macroeconomic outlook. Expected credit losses are estimated for commercial loans using a discounted cash flow over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. A loss rate methodology is utilized for consumer loans.
76
Adjustments may be made to baseline reserves based on an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality not fully reflected in the quantitative components of the allowance model. These influences may include elements such as changes in concentration, macroeconomic conditions, recent observable asset quality trends, staff turnover, regional market conditions, employment levels, model risk, and loan growth. Based upon management's assessments of these factors, the Company may apply qualitative adjustments to the allowance. 
Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. For loans that are individually evaluated, the allowance is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and the related collateral, if any. When management determines that foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. 
The allowance for PCD loans is determined at the time of acquisition as the estimated expected credit loss of the outstanding balance or par value, based on the methodologies described previously for loans. The allowance recognized at acquisition is added to the acquisition date purchase price to determine the asset’s amortized cost basis.
It is the Company's practice to ensure that the charge-off policy aligns with regulatory requirements. Losses on unsecured consumer loans are recognized at 90 days past due. In compliance with Federal Financial Institution Examination Council guidelines, secured consumer loans, including residential real estate, are typically charged off or charged down between 120 and 180 days past due, depending on the collateral type. Commercial loans and real estate loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due for 90 days or more, unless the loan is both secured by collateral having realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt in-full and the loan is in process of collection. Secured loans may be charged down to the estimated value of the collateral with previously accrued unpaid interest reversed against interest income. Subsequent charge-offs may be required as a result of changes in the market value of collateral or other repayment prospects. Initial charge-off amounts are based on valuation estimates derived from appraisals or other market information. Generally, updated appraisals are not received until the foreclosure process is completed; however, collateral values are evaluated periodically based on market information and incremental charge-offs are recorded if it is determined that collateral values have declined from their initial estimates.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
: The Company enters into derivative contracts, including swaps, to meet the needs of customers who request such services and to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Derivative contracts are carried at fair value and recorded in the consolidated balance sheet within Other Assets or Other Liabilities. The gain or loss resulting from changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated and qualifying as cash flow hedging instruments is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings through interest income in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss resulting from changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges is classified in the statement of income or comprehensive income in the line item associated with the instrument being hedged. 
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative contract is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is terminated, management determines that the designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate or, for a cash flow hedge, the occurrence of the forecasted transaction is no longer probable. When hedge accounting on a cash flow hedge is discontinued, any subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings. The cumulative unrealized gain or loss related to a discontinuing cash flow hedge continues to be reported in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transactions affects earnings, unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period, in which case the cumulative unrealized gain or loss in AOCI is reclassified into earnings immediately. 
Cash flows resulting from derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as hedges are classified in the cash flow statement in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items.

Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit:
 Loan commitments and letters of credit are an off-balance sheet item and represent commitments to make loans or lines of credit available to borrowers. The face amount of these commitments represents an exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such commitments are recognized as loans when funded. The Company estimates a reserve for potential losses on unfunded commitments, which is reported separately from the allowance for credit losses, within Other Liabilities. Changes to the allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments are recorded in noninterest expense on the income statement. The reserve is based upon the same quantitative and qualitative factors applied to the collectively evaluated loan portfolio. Fees on commitments are typically deferred and amortized to interest income over the life of the related loan, beginning with the initial borrowing.
77
Fair Value Measurements:
 The Company measures or monitors the fair value of many of its assets and liabilities. Certain assets are measured on a recurring basis, including available-for-sale securities, equity securities and derivatives. These assets are carried at fair value on the Company’s balance sheets. Additionally, fair value is measured on a non-recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment. Examples include collateral-dependent loans, OREO, loan servicing rights, and long-lived assets.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, the Company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value.
The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy:
Level 1 – Assets or liabilities for which the identical item is traded on an active exchange, such as publicly-traded instruments. 
Level 2 – Assets and liabilities valued based on observable market data for similar instruments.
Level 3 – Assets and liabilities for which significant valuation assumptions are not readily observable in the market; instruments valued based on the best available data, some of which is internally-developed, and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.
When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at and/or marked to fair value, the Company considers the principal market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities. When identical assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities. Certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets and the Company must use alternative valuation techniques to derive a fair value measurement.
Bank Premises and Equipment:
 Bank premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Premises and equipment include certain costs associated with the acquisition of leasehold improvements. Depreciation and amortization are recognized principally by the straight-line method, over the estimated useful lives as follows: buildings - 
25
-
40
 years, leasehold improvements - 
5
-
25
 years, furniture and equipment - 
3
-
12
 years. Leasehold improvements amortize over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life. Premises and equipment and other long-term assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If impaired, the assets are written down to fair value with a corresponding increase to noninterest expense.
Other Real Estate Owned:
 OREO consists of real estate taken in foreclosure of defaulted loan balances. These assets are carried at an amount equal to the loan balance prior to foreclosure plus costs incurred for improvements to the property, but no more than the estimated fair value of the property less estimated selling costs. Any valuation adjustments required at the date of transfer are charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequently, unrealized losses and realized gains and losses are included in other noninterest expense. Operating results from OREO are recorded in other noninterest expense.
OREO may also include bank premises no longer utilized in the course of the Company's business (closed branches) that are initially recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell. If the fair value of the premises is less than carrying value, a write down is recorded through noninterest expense. Costs to maintain the property are expensed.
Intangible Assets.
 The Company’s intangible assets consist of goodwill, CDI, customer relationship intangibles and loan servicing rights. Goodwill results from business combinations and represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill may be adjusted for up to one year from the acquisition date in the event new information is obtained which, if known at the date of the acquisition, would have impacted the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities. Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life and is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more often if circumstances arise that may indicate risk of impairment. If impaired, goodwill is written down with a corresponding impact to noninterest expense.
The Company recognizes CDI that result from either whole bank acquisitions or branch acquisitions. CDI is initially measured at fair value and then amortized over periods ranging from 
six
 to 
eight years
 generally on an accelerated basis. Customer relationship intangibles are measured at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over 
ten years
. The Company evaluates other identifiable intangibles for impairment annually, or more often if circumstances arise that may indicate risk of impairment. If impaired, the intangible asset is written down with a corresponding increase to noninterest expense.
Bank Owned Life Insurance:
 The Company, through its subsidiary bank, has purchased or acquired through bank acquisitions, life insurance policies on certain key executives and members of management. BOLI is recorded at the amount that can be 
78
realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.
Other Investments:
 Included in Other Assets are investments in funds generating affordable housing tax credits, and investments in SBICs, which are privately owned and operated companies licensed by the SBA to invest in small businesses. Investments generating tax credits are accounted for using the proportional amortization method. Under this method, the investor amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits allocated to the investor. The amortization is recorded in income tax expense within the income statement, which is the location the related tax credits are recorded. SBIC investments are accounted for using the net asset value practical expedient as provided in the financial statements received from the SBICs. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2024, SBIC investments were accounted for at cost less impairment, if any. Income from SBIC investments is recognized in noninterest income.
Seacoast Bank is a member of the FHLB and FRB systems. Members are required to own a certain amount of FHLB and FRB stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. The FHLB and FRB stock are accounted for at cost less impairment, if any. Both cash and stock dividends are recognized in earnings.

Leases:
 Arrangements are analyzed at inception to determine the existence of a lease. ROUAs represent the right to use the underlying asset and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments for the lease term. Operating lease ROUAs and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the appropriate term and information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The lease term may include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. ROUAs and operating lease liabilities are reported in Other Assets and Other Liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is classified as Occupancy or Furniture and Equipment expense based on the subject asset.

Revenue Recognition:
 The Company recognizes two types of revenue in its Consolidated Statements of Income, interest income and noninterest income. The Company's principal source of revenue is interest income from loans and securities which is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. 
Noninterest income includes revenue from various types of transactions and services provided to customers. The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers as performance obligations are satisfied. Performance obligations are typically satisfied in one year or less. Relevant activity includes: 
•
Service Charges on Deposits: Seacoast Bank offers a variety of deposit-related services to its customers through several delivery channels including branch offices, ATMs, telephone, mobile, and internet banking. Transaction-based fees are recognized when services, each of which represents a performance obligation, are satisfied. Service fees may be assessed monthly, quarterly, or annually; however, the account agreements to which these fees relate can be canceled at any time by Seacoast and/or the customer. Therefore, the contract term is considered a single day (a day-to-day contract). 
•
Wealth Management Income: The Company earns trust fees from fiduciary services provided to trust customers, which include custody of assets, recordkeeping, collection and distribution of funds. Fees are earned over time and accrued monthly as the Company provides services, and are generally assessed based on the market value of the trust assets under management at a particular date or over a particular period. The Company also earns commissions and fees from investment brokerage services provided to its customers through an arrangement with a third-party service provider. Commissions received from the third-party service provider are recorded monthly and are based upon customer activity. Fees are earned over time and accrued monthly as services are provided. The Company acts as an agent in this arrangement and therefore presents the brokerage commissions and fees net of related costs. 
•
Interchange Income: Fees earned on card transactions depend upon the volume of activity, as well as the fees permitted by the payment network. Such fees are recognized by the Company upon fulfilling its performance obligation to approve the card transaction. 
•
Insurance Agency Income: Insurance commissions are earned upon the sale of insurance products as agent and are paid by the insurance companies upon the completion of application requirements and receipt of client payment to the insurance company. The commissions are recognized upon the placement date of the insurance policies, representing the Company’s related performance obligations. Commission payment is normally received within the policy period.
79
Treasury Stock and Share Repurchases: 
The Company's repurchases of shares of its common stock are recorded at cost as additional paid-in capital and result in a reduction of shareholders' equity. Activity in treasury stock represents shares traded to offset employee payroll taxes on vested shares. Shares held in treasury are also used for employee share purchases through the Company's employee stock purchase plan.
Stock-Based Compensation: 
For restricted stock awards, which generally vest based on continued service with the Company, the deferred compensation is measured as the fair value of the shares on the date of grant, and the deferred compensation is amortized as salaries and wages expense in accordance with the applicable vesting schedule, generally straight-line over 
three years
. Some award shares vest based upon the Company achieving certain performance goals and the amortization expense recorded within salaries and wages is based on an estimate of the most likely results on a straight line basis. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with market assumptions. The fair value is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, generally 
five years
. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.

Income Taxes
: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and their related tax bases and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are in effect. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in rates is recognized as income or expense in the period in which the change occurs.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,

Note 2 - Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period, plus common share equivalents, calculated for share-based awards outstanding using the treasury stock method. 
In 2024, 2023 and 2022, options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock totaling 
327,186
, 
344,230
 and 
1,505

Comprised of 
504
 individual securities
At December 31, 2024, the Company had unrealized losses of $
0.5
 million on U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government agencies having a fair value of $
22.9
 million. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The Company does not expect individual securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, a U.S. agency, or a sponsored U.S. agency to incur future losses of principal. Based on the assessment of all relevant factors, the Company believes that the unrealized loss positions on these debt securities are a function of changes in investment spreads and interest rate movements and not changes in credit quality, and expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. Therefore, at December 31, 2024, 
no
 allowance for credit losses has been recorded.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had unrealized losses of $
200.8
 million on commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by government-sponsored entities having a fair value of $
1.5
 billion. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and have a long history of no credit losses. The implied government guarantee of principal and interest payments and the high credit rating of the portfolio provide a sufficient basis for the current expectation that there is no risk of loss if default were to occur. Based on the assessment of all relevant factors, the Company believes that the unrealized loss positions on these debt securities are a function of changes in investment spreads and interest rate movements and not changes in credit quality and expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. Therefore, at December 31, 2024, 
no
 allowance for credit losses has been recorded. 
At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
8.4
 million of unrealized losses on private label residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations having a fair value of $
108.4
 million. The securities have weighted average credit support of 
22
%. Of the $
108.4
 million, $
99.0
 million are private label residential securities with unrealized losses of $
8.2
 million  and $
9.4
 million are private label commercial securities with unrealized losses of $
0.2
 million. Based on the evaluation of available information relevant to collectibility, the Company believes that the unrealized loss positions on these debt securities are a function of changes in investment spreads and interest rate movements and not changes in credit quality and expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. Therefore, at December 31, 2024, 
no
 allowance for credit losses has been recorded.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
0.2
 million of unrealized losses in floating rate CLOs having a fair value of $
51.0
 million. CLOs are special purpose vehicles and those in which the Company has invested are nearly all first-lien, broadly syndicated corporate loans across a diversified band of industries while providing support to senior tranche investors. As of December 31, 2024, all positions held by the Company are in AAA and AA tranches, with weighted average credit support of 
36
% and 
31
%, respectively. The Company evaluates the securities for potential credit losses by modeling expected loan-level defaults, recoveries, and prepayments for each CLO security. Based on the evaluation of available information relevant to collectibility, the Company believes that the unrealized loss positions on these debt securities are a function of changes in investment spreads and interest rate movement and not changes in credit quality and expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. Therefore, at December 31, 2024, 
no
 allowance for credit losses has been recorded.
84
At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
1.4
 million of unrealized losses on municipal securities having a fair value of $
5.7
 million. These securities are highly rated issuances of state or local municipalities, all of which are continuing to make timely contractual payments. Based on the evaluation of available information relevant to collectibility, the Company believes that the unrealized loss positions on these debt securities are a function of changes in investment spreads and interest rate movements and not changes in credit quality and expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. As a result, as of December 31, 2024, 
no
 allowance for credit losses has been recorded.
All HTM debt securities are issued by government-sponsored entities, which are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and have a long history of no credit losses. The implied government guarantee of principal and interest payments and the high credit rating of the HTM portfolio provide sufficient basis for the current expectation that there is no risk of loss if a default were to occur. As a result, as of December 31, 2024, 
no
 allowance for credit losses has been recorded. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these securities until maturity.
Included in Other Assets at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, is $
77.3
 million and $
67.7
 million, respectively, of FHLB and FRB stock stated at par value. The Company has not identified events or changes in circumstances which may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of these cost method investment securities. Accrued interest receivable on AFS and HTM debt securities of $
9.2
 million and $
1.0
 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024, and $
7.9
 million and $
1.1
 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023, is included in 
Other Assets
. Also included in Other Assets are investments in CRA-qualified mutual funds carried at fair value of $
13.5
 million and $
13.6
 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
At December 31, 2023, the Company held 
11,330
 shares of Visa Class B stock. During 2024, the Company sold all of its Visa Class B stock, receiving net proceeds of $
4.1
 million. The ownership of Visa stock was related to prior ownership in Visa's network while Visa operated as a cooperative and was recorded on the Company's financial records at a zero basis.
85
Note 4 - Loans
Loans held for investment are categorized into the following segments:
•
Construction and land development: Loans are extended to both commercial and consumer customers which are collateralized by and for the purpose of funding land development and construction projects, including commercial, 1-4 family residential, multi-family, and non-farm residential properties where the primary source of repayment is from proceeds of the sale, refinancing or permanent financing of the property.
•
Commercial real estate - owner-occupied: Loans are extended to commercial customers for the purpose of acquiring or refinancing real estate to be occupied by the borrower's business. These loans are collateralized by the subject property and the repayment of these loans is largely dependent on the performance of the company occupying the property.
•
Commercial real estate - non owner-occupied: Loans are extended to commercial customers for the purpose of acquiring or refinancing commercial property where occupancy by the borrower is not their primary intent. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans, collateralized by the subject property, and the repayment of these loans is largely dependent on rental income from third parties or from the sale of the property.
•
Residential real estate: Loans are extended to consumer customers and collateralized primarily by 1-4 family residential properties and include fixed and variable rate mortgages, home equity mortgages, and HELOCs. Loans are primarily written based on conventional loan agency guidelines, including loans that exceed agency value limitations. Sources of repayment are largely dependent on the occupant of the residential property. 
•
Commercial and financial: Loans are extended to commercial customers. The purpose of the loans can be working capital, physical asset expansion, asset acquisition or other business purposes. Loans may be collateralized by assets owned by the borrower or the borrower's business. Commercial loans are based primarily on the historical and projected cash flow of the borrower's business and secondarily on the capacity of credit enhancements, guarantees and underlying collateral provided by the borrower.
•
Consumer: Loans are extended to consumer customers. The segment includes both installment loans and lines of credit which may be collateralized or non-collateralized.

All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Interest subsequently received on such loans is accounted for under the cost-recovery method, whereby interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is paid down to zero. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, and future payments are reasonably assured. The Company recognized interest income of $
1.3
 million, $
0.5
 million, and $
1.6
 million on nonaccrual loans during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Loans by Risk Rating 
The Company utilizes an internal asset classification system as a means of identifying problem and potential problem loans. The following classifications are used to categorize loans under the internal classification system:
•
Pass: Loans that are not problem loans or potential problem loans are considered to be pass-rated.
•
Special Mention: Loans that do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in the Substandard or Doubtful categories, but possess weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention are deemed to be Special Mention.
•
Substandard: Loans with the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
•
Doubtful: Loans that have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weakness present makes collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

Management establishes the allowance using relevant available information from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Forecast data is sourced from Moody’s, a firm widely recognized for its research, analysis, and economic forecasts. The forecasts of future economic conditions are over the expected remaining life of the loan using economic forecasts that revert to long-term historical averages over time.
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company utilized a multiple scenario model comprised of a blend of Moody’s economic scenarios and considered the uncertainty associated with the assumptions in the scenarios, including 
96
continued actions taken by the Federal Reserve with regard to monetary policy and interest rates and the potential impact of those actions. Outcomes could differ from the scenarios utilized, and the Company incorporated qualitative considerations reflecting the risk of uncertain economic conditions, and for additional dimensions of risk that may not be captured in the quantitative model.
The following section discusses changes in the level of the allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2024.
The allowance decreased $
10.9
 million, or 
7.3
%, during 2024 to $
138.1
 million, or 
1.34
%, of loans held for investment as of December 31, 2024.
In the Construction and Land Development segment, the decrease in the allowance is primarily due to a decrease in outstanding loan balances. In this segment, the primary source of repayment typically stems from proceeds of the sale or permanent financing of the underlying property. Therefore, industry, collateral type and estimated collateral values are among the relevant factors in assessing expected losses.
In the Commercial Real Estate - Owner-Occupied segment, the allowance increased due to continued uncertainty in connection with commercial real estate valuations broadly. Risk characteristics include, but are not limited to, collateral type, note structure, and loan seasoning.
In the Commercial Real Estate - Non-Owner-Occupied segment, the allowance decrease is driven by an improvement in the economic forecast, partially offset by the impact of higher outstanding loan balances. Repayment is often dependent upon rental income from the successful operation of the underlying property or from the sale of the property. Loan performance may be adversely affected by general economic conditions or conditions specific to the real estate market, including property types. Collateral type, note structure, and loan seasoning are among the risk characteristics analyzed for this segment.
The Residential Real Estate segment includes residential mortgage, home equity loans and HELOCs. The allowance reflects higher loan balances partially offset by an improvement in macroeconomic factors. Risk characteristics considered for this segment include, but are not limited to, borrower FICO score, lien position, loan to value ratios, and loan seasoning.
In the Commercial and Financial segment, borrowers are primarily small to medium-sized professional firms and other businesses, and loans are generally supported by projected cash flows of the business, collateralized by business assets, and/or guaranteed by the business owners. The decrease in the allowance is primarily due to resolution of several impaired relationships that were previously reserved. Industry, collateral type, estimated collateral values, and loan seasoning are among the relevant factors in assessing expected losses.
Consumer loans include installment and revolving lines, loans for automobiles, boats, and other personal or family purposes. Risk characteristics considered for this segment include, but are not limited to, collateral type, loan to value ratios, loan seasoning and FICO scores. The decrease in allowance for Consumer was driven by the decision to sell approximately $
20
 million in acquired unsecured loans, resulting in a decrease in loan balances and charge-offs of $
2.9
 million upon the transfer to held-for-sale.
Note 6 – Derivatives
Interest Rate Contracts
The Company offers interest rate swaps when requested by customers to allow them to hedge the risk of rising interest rates on their variable rate loans. Upon entering into these swaps, the Company enters into offsetting positions with counterparties in order to minimize the interest rate risk. These back-to-back swaps are freestanding financial derivatives with the fair values reported in Other Assets and Other Liabilities. The Company is party to master netting arrangements with its financial institution counterparties; however, the Company does not offset assets and liabilities under the arrangements for financial statement presentation purposes. Gains and losses on these back-to-back swaps, which offset, are recorded through noninterest income.
Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Fair Value Hedges
The Company has entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of the AFS securities portfolio due to changes in SOFR. The Company considers these derivatives to be highly effective at offsetting changes in interest rates and assesses the effectiveness on a quarterly basis. The effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of these derivative contracts is recognized in other comprehensive income. These derivative instruments are primarily for risk management purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized, through other comprehensive income, 
97
net losses of $
2.7
 million, and reclassified net gains of $
0.4
 million out of accumulated other comprehensive income into interest income. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized net gains through other comprehensive income of $
2.6
 million and reclassified net gains of $
35
 thousand out of accumulated other comprehensive income into interest income.
The Company has entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of a pool of residential mortgages due to changes in SOFR. These fair value hedges utilize the portfolio layer method. The Company considers these derivatives to be highly effective at offsetting changes in interest rates and assesses the effectiveness on a quarterly basis. The effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of these derivative contracts is recognized in interest income. These derivative instruments are primarily for risk management purposes. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recognized gains through interest income of $
2.3
 million and $
16
 thousand, respectively.

The Company performs an analysis for goodwill impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently as considered necessary. The Company performed a qualitative goodwill assessment in the fourth quarter of 2024, and concluded that a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not necessary as it was not more likely-than-not that the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit was below the carrying amount. Based on the analyses performed, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired during the periods presented.
Acquired intangible assets primarily consist of CDI, which are intangible assets arising from the purchase of deposits separately or from bank acquisitions.

Acquired junior subordinated debentures were recorded at their acquisition date fair values, which collectively was $
5.6
 million lower than face value; this amount is being amortized into interest expense over the remaining term to maturity.
Interest on the trust preferred securities is calculated on the basis of 3-month SOFR plus spread and is re-set quarterly. The trust preferred securities may be redeemed without penalty, upon approval of the FRB or upon occurrence of certain events affecting their tax or regulatory capital treatment. The proceeds of the offering of trust preferred securities and common equity securities were used by SBCF Capital Trust I and SBCF Statutory Trust II to purchase the $
41.2
 million junior subordinated deferrable interest notes issued by the Company, and by SBCF Statutory Trust III to purchase the $
12.4
 million junior subordinated deferrable interest notes issued by the Company, all of which have terms substantially similar to the trust preferred securities. 
The Company has the right to defer payments of interest on the notes at any time or from time to time at the Company's election. Interest can be deferred for a period not longer than five years. If the Company elects to defer interest, it may not, with certain exceptions, declare or pay any dividends or distributions on its capital stock or purchase or acquire any of its capital stock. As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, all interest payments on trust preferred securities were current.
101
Distributions on the trust preferred securities are payable quarterly. The Company has entered into agreements to guarantee the payments of distributions on the trust preferred securities and payments of redemption of the trust preferred securities. Under these agreements, the Company also agrees, on a subordinated basis, to pay expenses and liabilities of the Trusts other than those arising under the trust preferred securities. The obligations of the Company under the junior subordinated notes, the trust agreement establishing the Trusts, the guarantees and agreements as to expenses and liabilities, in aggregate, constitute a full and conditional guarantee by the Company of the Trusts' obligations under the trust preferred securities.
In 2022, the Company obtained $
12.3
 million in senior notes through the acquisition of Apollo. Contractual interest is paid on a semiannual basis at a fixed rate of 
5.50
% until October 30, 2025, at which point the rate converts to a floating rate of 3-month SOFR plus 
533
 basis points. At and after October 30, 2025, the notes are redeemable at par. The debt was recorded at fair value, resulting in a $
0.4
 million premium that is being amortized into interest expense over the remaining term to maturity.
In 2023, the Company acquired $
25.0
 million in subordinated debt through the acquisition of Professional. Contractual interest is paid on a semiannual basis at a fixed interest rate of 
3.375
% until January 30, 2027, at which point the rate converts to a 3-month SOFR rate plus 
203
 basis points paid quarterly. At and after January 30, 2027, the notes are redeemable at par. The debt was recorded at fair value, resulting in a $
3.9
 million discount that is being accreted into interest expense over the remaining term to maturity.
Note 10 - Employee Benefits and Stock Compensation
The Company’s defined contribution plan covers substantially all employees after one year of service and includes a matching benefit for employees who can elect to defer a portion of their compensation. In addition, amounts of compensation contributed by employees are matched on a percentage basis under the plan. The Company's contributions to this plan charged to expense were $
5.2
 million in 2024, $
4.8
 million in 2023, and $
3.5
 million in 2022.
The Company, through its Compensation and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”), offers equity compensation to employees and non-employee directors of Seacoast and Seacoast Bank in the form of various share-based awards, including stock options, RSAs, or RSUs. The awards may vest over time, have certain performance based criteria, or both.
Stock options are granted with an exercise price at least equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant. The fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Compensation cost is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Vesting is determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, generally over 
five years
. The options have a maximum term of 
ten years
. 
The fair value of RSAs and RSUs are estimated based on the price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost is measured straight-line for RSAs and ratably for RSUs over the vesting period of the awards and reversed for awards that are forfeited due to unfulfilled service or performance criteria. To the extent the Company has treasury shares available, stock options exercised or stock grants awarded may be issued from treasury shares. If treasury shares are insufficient, the Company can issue new shares.
Vesting of share-based awards is immediately accelerated on death or disability of the recipient. The Compensation Committee may, at its discretion, accelerate vesting upon retirement or upon the event of a change-in-control.
Awards are currently granted under the Seacoast 2021 Incentive Plan (“2021 Plan”), with 
3,750,000
 authorized shares for issuance, plus shares of underlying awards outstanding under the 2013 Incentive Plan (the “Prior Plan”) that thereafter terminate or expire unexercised or are cancelled, forfeited or lapse for any reason under the Prior Plan.

Included in the table above is the effect of temporary differences associated with the Company's investments in debt securities accounted for under ASC Topic 320, 
Investments - Debt Securities,
 for which no deferred tax expense or benefit was recognized. These items are recorded as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the shareholders' equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. In 2024, net unrealized losses on debt securities of $
207.3
 million resulted in a deferred tax asset of $
49.4
 million. In 2023, unrealized losses of $
212.7
 million resulted in a deferred tax asset of $
50.8
 million.
At December 31, 2024, the Company's net DTAs of $
103.0
 million consisted of $
87.0
 million of net U.S. federal DTAs and $
20.7
 million of net state DTAs. At December 31, 2023, the Company's net DTAs of $
113.2
 million consisted of $
91.0
 million of net U.S. federal DTAs and $
22.2
 million of net state DTAs.
Management assesses the necessity of a valuation allowance recorded against DTAs at each reporting period. The determination of whether a valuation allowance for net DTAs is appropriate is subject to considerable judgment and requires an evaluation of positive and negative evidence. Based on an assessment of relevant evidence, including favorable trending in asset quality and certainty regarding the amount of future taxable income that the Company forecasts, management concluded that it was more likely than not that its net DTAs will be realized based upon future taxable income. Management's determination in the realization of projected future taxable income is based upon analysis of the Company's risk profile and its trending financial performance, including credit quality. The Company believes it can reasonably predict future results of operations that result in taxable income at sufficient levels over the future period of time that the Company has available to realize its net DTA.
Management expects to realize the $
103.0
 million in net DTAs well in advance of the statutory carryforward period. At December 31, 2024, approximately $
2.4
 million of DTAs related to federal net operating losses which will expire in annual installments beginning in 2029 through 2032. Additionally, $
1.2
 million of the DTAs related to state net operating losses which will expire in annual installments beginning in 2029 through 2034. Remaining DTAs are not related to net operating losses or credits and therefore, have no expiration date.
107
The Company recognizes interest and penalties, as appropriate, as part of the provisioning for income taxes. 
No
 interest or penalties were accrued at December 31, 2024.
In accordance with ASC Topic 718, 
Compensation – Stock Compensation,
 the Company recognized net expense of $
0.2
 million and benefits of $
0.5
 million and $
1.1
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, of discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation.

Note 13 - Regulatory Capital
Required Regulatory Capital
The Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal banking agencies. Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by the regulators, which could have a direct material impact on the financial statements. These requirements involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items calculated pursuant to regulatory guidance. The Company's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total, Tier 1 capital and common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets, all as defined in the regulations. 
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company and Seacoast Bank, its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, were both considered “well-capitalized” based on the applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements as reflected in the table below:

Note 15 - Contingent Liabilities and Commitments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
The Company and its subsidiaries, because of the nature of their business, are at all times subject to numerous legal actions, threatened or filed. Management presently believes that none of the legal proceedings to which it is a party are likely to have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, operating results or cash flows.
The Company's subsidiary bank is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and limited partner equity commitments.
The subsidiary bank’s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contract or notional amount of those instruments. The subsidiary bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and standby letters of credit as they do for on balance sheet instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Commitments include home equity lines, commercial and consumer lines of credit and construction loans. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The subsidiary bank evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and commercial and residential real estate.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the subsidiary bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These instruments have fixed termination dates and most end without being drawn; therefore, they do not represent a significant liquidity risk. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The subsidiary bank holds collateral supporting these commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. Collateral held for secured standby letters of credit at December 31, 2024 totaled $
36.8
 million.
Unfunded limited partner equity commitments at December 31, 2024 totaled $
25.5
 million that the Company has committed to small business investment companies under the SBIC Act to be used to provide capital to small businesses and entities that provide low income housing tax credits.

See “

2
Recurring fair value basis determined using observable market data.
3
Fair value is measured on a nonrecurring basis.
4
Investment in shares of mutual funds that invest primarily in CRA-qualified debt securities, reported at fair value in Other Assets. Recurring fair value basis is determined using market quotations.
Debt securities available-for-sale
: Level 1 securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities. Other securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The estimated fair value of a security is determined based on market quotations when available or, if not available, by using quoted market prices for similar securities, pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses, using observable market data where available.
Derivative financial instruments
: The fair value of these derivatives is based on a discounted cash flow approach. Due to the observable nature of the inputs used in deriving the fair value of these derivative contracts, the valuation of interest rate swaps is classified as Level 2. The fair values of these instruments are based upon the estimated amount the Company would receive or pay to terminate the instruments, taking into account current interest rates and, when appropriate, the current credit worthiness of the counterparties.
Loans held for sale
: Fair values are based upon estimated values to be received from independent third party purchasers. These loans are intended for sale and the Company believes the fair value is the best indicator of the resolution of these loans. Fair market value changes occur due to changes in interest rates, the borrower’s credit, the secondary loan market and the market for a borrower’s debt. Interest income is recorded based on contractual terms of the loan in accordance with Company's policy on loans held for investment.
Loans and other real estate owned
: Fair values of collateral-dependent real estate loans and OREO are based on recent real 
113
estate appraisals less estimated costs of sale. Evaluations may use either a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches, such as comparative sales, cost and/or income approach. Adjustments to comparable sales may be made by an appraiser to reflect local market conditions or other economic factors and may result in changes in the fair value of an asset over time, but none were made by management. As such, the fair values of these loans and properties are considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Collateral-dependent loans measured at fair value totaled $
3.0
 million with a specific reserve of $
1.2
 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $
17.8
 million with a specific reserve of $
2.6
 million at December 31, 2023.
For recurring fair value measurements, transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the actual date of the event or circumstances that caused the transfer, which generally coincides with the Company's monthly and/or quarterly valuation process. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no such transfers. 
The carrying amount and fair value of the Company's other financial instruments that were not disclosed previously in the balance sheet and for which carrying amount is not fair value as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:

See “
Note 3 - Securities
” for further detail of recurring fair value basis of individual investment categories.
The short maturity of Seacoast’s assets and liabilities results in having a significant number of financial instruments whose fair value equals or closely approximates carrying value. Such financial instruments are reported in the following balance sheet captions: cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, short-term FHLB borrowings and securities sold under agreement to repurchase.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that value at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:
Held-to-maturity debt securities
: These debt securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The estimated fair value of a security is determined based on market quotations when available or, if not available, by using quoted market prices for similar securities, pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses, using observable market data where available.
The Company reviews the prices supplied by independent pricing services, as well as their underlying pricing methodologies, for reasonableness and to ensure such prices are aligned with traditional pricing matrices. From time to time, the Company will validate, on a sample basis, prices supplied by the independent pricing service by comparison to prices obtained from other brokers and third-party sources or derived using internal models.
114
Loans
: Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, such as commercial or mortgage. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable-rate interest terms as well as performing and nonperforming categories. The fair value of loans is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated life including prepayment considerations, using estimated market discount rates that reflect the risks inherent in the loan. The fair value approach considers market-driven variables including credit related factors and reflects an “exit price” as defined in ASC Topic 820.
Investments at NAV: 
The Company has equity investments in SBICs accounted for under the fair value practical expedient of NAV totaling $
21.1
 million at December 31, 2024, which are not included in the fair value hierarchy. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2024, SBIC investments were accounted for at cost less impairment, if any and as of December 31, 2023, the SBIC investments totaled $
15.6
 million. These investments are made primarily through various SBIC funds as a strategy to provide expansion and growth opportunities to small businesses and are subject to various risks, including market, liquidity and credit risk. SBIC’s are generally structured to operate for approximately 10 years and the Company’s investments are not redeemable. Distributions are received through the liquidation of the underlying assets, which is expected to occur over the next 
5
-
10
 years. At December 31, 2024, unfunded commitments related to these investments were $
7.1
 million. 
Deposit Liabilities
: The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and money market deposits is the amount payable at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for funding of similar remaining maturities.
Note 17 - Business Combinations
Acquisition of Professional Holding Corp.
On January 31, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Professional. Simultaneously, upon completion of the merger of Professional and the Company, Professional Bank was merged with and into Seacoast Bank. Prior to the acquisition, Professional Bank operated 
nine
 branches across South Florida. The transaction further expanded the Company’s presence in the tri-county South Florida market, which includes Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties, Florida’s largest MSA and the 8th largest in the nation. The Company acquired 
100
% of the outstanding common stock of Professional. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Professional shareholders received 
0.8909
 shares of Seacoast common stock for each share of Professional common stock held immediately prior to the merger, and Professional option holders received options to purchase Seacoast common stock, with the number of shares underlying each such option and the applicable exercise price adjusted using the same 
0.8909
 exchange ratio.

The acquisition of Professional was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, 
Business Combinations
. The Company recognized goodwill of $
251.7
 million for this acquisition that is nondeductible for tax purposes. Determining fair values of assets and liabilities, especially the loan portfolio, core deposit intangibles, and deferred taxes, is a complicated process involving significant judgment regarding methods and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair values. 
As part of the acquisition of Professional, options to purchase shares of Seacoast common stock were granted to replace outstanding Professional options. These options were fully vested upon acquisition. The full value of the replacement options, $
10.3
 million, was associated with pre-combination service and was therefore included in the calculation of the total purchase consideration.

Note 18 - Business Segment
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company adopted ASU 2023-07, 
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which enhanced the disclosure of reportable segments and other items on an interim and annual basis.
The Company's 
one
 reportable segment provides integrated financial services including commercial and consumer banking, wealth management, and mortgage and insurance services to customers. Segment revenues are driven primarily by interest and fees on loans, interest on cash and cash equivalents and on investment securities, and fees on depository products and services.
The Company manages business activities, allocates resources and evaluates financial performance on an organization-wide basis. The chief operating decision maker ("CODM") is the CEO. The financial results of the segment are presented using the same policies described in "Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies."
The CODM evaluates the performance of the segment and allocates resources based on net income that is also reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income as consolidated net income and segment assets that are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as total consolidated assets. Net income is used to monitor budget versus actual results. The CODM also uses net income in competitive analysis by benchmarking to the Company's competitors. The competitive analysis along with the monitoring of budgeted versus actual results are used in assessing performance of the segment and in establishing management's compensation. The significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM are interest expense, provision for credit losses, salaries and wages, employee benefits, outsourced data processing costs, and occupancy, which are 
123
all reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain noncash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense, are disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
