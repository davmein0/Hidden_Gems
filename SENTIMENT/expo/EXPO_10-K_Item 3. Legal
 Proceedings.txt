Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Sto
ckholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Exponent’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol “EXPO.” As of February 21, 2025, there were 162 holders of record of our common stock. Because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we believe that there are considerably more beneficial holders of our common stock than record holders.

COMPANY STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE GRAPH

This graph compares the Company’s cumulative total stockholder return calculated on a dividend-reinvested basis from 2020 through 2024 with those of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index, the S&P MidCap 400 Index, and the S&P SmallCap 600 Index. The Company does not have a comparable peer group and thus has selected the S&P MidCap 400 Index. The graph assumes that $100 was invested on the last day of 2019. Note that the historic price performance is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.

This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2023 and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Annual Report form 10-K can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023.

OVERVIEW

Exponent is an engineering and scientific consulting firm providing solutions to complex problems. Exponent's interdisciplinary organization of scientists, physicians, engineers, and business consultants draws from more than 90 technical disciplines to solve the most pressing and complicated challenges facing stakeholders today. The firm leverages over 50 years of experience in analyzing accidents and failures to advise clients as they innovate their technologically complex products and processes, ensure the safety and health of their users, and address the challenges of sustainability.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in accounting for revenue recognition and estimating the allowance for contract losses and doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. We discuss below the assumptions, judgments and estimates associated with these policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. For further information on our critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue recognition. 
We derive our revenues primarily from professional fees earned on consulting engagements, fees earned for the use of our equipment and facilities, as well as reimbursements for outside direct expenses associated with the services that are billed to our clients.

Substantially all of our engagements are service contracts performed under time and material or fixed-price billing arrangements. For time and material and fixed-price service projects, revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed. For substantially all of our fixed-price service engagements, we recognize revenue based on the relationship of incurred labor hours at standard rates to our estimate of the total labor hours at standard rates we expect to incur over the term of the contract. Our estimate of total labor hours we expect to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our past experience on similar projects. We believe this methodology achieves a reliable measure of the revenue from the consulting services we provide to our customers under fixed-price contracts.

Management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period. These judgments and estimates include an assessment of the estimate as to the total effort required to complete fixed-price projects.

Estimating the allowance for contract losses and doubtful accounts. 
We make estimates of our ability to collect accounts receivable and our unbilled but recognized work-in-process. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us or for disputes with customers that affect our ability to fully collect our accounts receivable and unbilled work-in-process, we record a specific allowance to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers we recognize allowances for contract losses and doubtful accounts taking into consideration factors such as historical write-offs, customer concentration, customer creditworthiness, current and forecasts of future economic conditions, and aging of amounts due.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Revenues and revenues before reimbursements for 2024 increased 4% as compared to the prior year. Our focus on effective resource management drove significant improvement in utilization. Demand for our proactive services strengthened during the year driven by the consumer electronics and utilities industries. We saw increased activity in user research studies and product development consulting in the consumer electronics sector and strong demand for our risk-related work in utilities. Growth in reactive services was supported by strong activity in the utilities and medical device industries. With increasing global demand for energy and the related investments in infrastructure, we are actively involved in failure analysis and dispute-related projects around the world. Our multidisciplinary team of scientists and engineers continues to provide critical data, analyses and insights for our clients.

Society is raising the bar for safety, health, sustainability and reliability, and clients are increasingly seeking our interdisciplinary proactive solutions. As our suite of offerings and key markets expands, so does the demand for our multidisciplinary services. We continue to expand our client relationships and enhance our reputation and capabilities across the firm. As innovation and technology become increasingly complex, the critical nature of our insights uniquely positions Exponent to address our clients’ needs throughout the product lifecycle.

Net income increased 9% to $109,002,000 during 2024 as compared to $100,339,000 during 2023. Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.11 for 2024 as compared to $1.94 for 2023. The increase in profitability was due to our continued efforts to better align resources with demand. Net income and diluted earnings per share for 2024 and 2023 benefited from the excess tax benefit associated with stock-based awards. The excess tax benefit associated with stock-based awards decreased to $2,793,000 during 2024 as compared to $3,620,000 during 2023. The decrease in the excess tax benefit was due to a smaller increase in value of our common stock between the grant date and the release date for the restricted stock units released during 2024 as compared to 2023.

We remain focused on building our world-class engineering and scientific team to position Exponent at the forefront of innovation and meet the ever-changing needs of our clients and the market. We also remain focused on capitalizing on emerging growth areas, managing other operating expenses, generating cash from operations, maintaining a strong balance sheet and undertaking activities such as share repurchases and dividends to enhance shareholder value.

The increase in revenues for our Engineering and Other Scientific segment was due to an increase in billing rates and an increase in billable hours. Growth in this segment during 2024 was primary driven by demand for our services across the consumer products and utilities industries. In the consumer electronics sector we advised clients on projects related to digital health and wearables, such as advanced sensors in health applications and engagements in augmented and virtual reality. During 2024, billable hours for this segment increased by 1% to 1,199,000 as compared to 1,188,000 during 2023. Utilization for this segment increased to 75% for 2024 as compared to 70% for 2023 due to our continued efforts to align resources with demand. Technical full-time equivalent employees in this segment decreased 7% to 759 during 2024 as compared to 818 for 2023.

The decrease in revenues from our Environmental and Health segment was due to a decrease in billable hours partially offset by an increase in billing rates. During 2024, billable hours for this segment decreased by 4% to 296,000 as compared to 307,000 during 2023. The decrease in billable hours was related to headwinds in the chemical and life sciences sectors. Utilization for this segment increased to 67% for 2024 as compared to 64% for 2023 due to our continued efforts to align resources with demand. Technical full-time equivalents decreased 9% to 208 during 2024 as compared to 229 for 2023.

Revenues are primarily derived from services provided in response to client requests or events that occur without notice and engagements are generally terminable or subject to postponement or delay at any time by our clients. As a result, backlog at any particular time is small in relation to our quarterly or annual revenues and is not a reliable indicator of revenues for any future periods.

The increase in compensation and related expenses during 2024 was due an increase in payroll expense, an increase in bonus expense and an increase in stock-based compensation. During 2024, payroll expense increased $3,771,000 due to the impact of our annual salary increase partially offset by a decrease in technical full-time equivalent employees. During 2024, bonus expense increased by $5,096,000 due to a corresponding increase in our bonus pool. Stock-based compensation increased $1,150,000 during 2024 due to an increase in unvested restricted stock unit grants.  We expect compensation expense, excluding the change in value of deferred compensation plan assets, to increase as we selectively add new talent and adjust compensation to market conditions.

Other operating expenses include facilities-related costs, technical materials, computer-related expenses and depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in occupancy expense of $3,437,000, an increase in information technology related expenses of $839,000 and an increase in depreciation expense of $773,000. Our land lease with the State of Arizona was extended on June 19, 2024. This extension resulted in additional non-cash rent expense of approximately $2,316,000 during 2024. The remainder of the increase in occupancy expense was due to investments in our office and laboratory facilities. The increases in depreciation and information technology related expenses were due to continued investment in our corporate infrastructure. We expect other operating expenses to grow as we selectively add new talent and continue to make investments in our corporate infrastructure.

The decrease in general and administrative expenses during 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in outside consulting expenses of $1,304,000, a decrease in travel and meals of $844,000 and a decrease in personnel expenses of $673,000. Outside consulting decreased primarily due to activity associated with content creation for our external website during 2023. The decrease in travel and meals was due to the decrease in technical full-time equivalent employees and a firm-wide principals' meeting which was held in 2023.We did not have any firm-wide meetings during 2024. The decrease in personnel expenses was due to lower relocation and recruiting costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we expand our business development and staff development initiatives.

Certain operating expenses are excluded from our measure of segment operating income. These expenses include the costs associated with our human resources, finance, information technology, corporate, and business development groups; the deferred compensation expense/benefit due to the change in value of assets associated with our deferred compensation plan; stock-based compensation associated with restricted stock unit and stock option awards; and the change in our allowance for contract losses and doubtful accounts. The increase in corporate operating expenses was due to an increase in stock-based compensation and an increase in the provision for contract losses and doubtful accounts.

The excess tax benefit associated with stock-based awards decreased to $2,793,000 during 2024 as compared to $3,620,000 during 2023. The decrease in the excess tax benefit was due to a smaller increase in the value of our common stock between the grant date and the release date for the restricted stock units released in 2024 as compared to restricted stock units released in 2023. Excluding the impact of the excess tax benefit, the effective tax rate would have been 27.9% and 28.8% for 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate, excluding the

31

impact of the excess tax benefit, was primarily due to a re-measurement that reduced the value of our deferred tax assets in connection with relocating one of our offices to a location designated as tax exempt for all state and local taxes during 2023.

We financed our business in 2024 through available cash and cash flows from operating activities. We invest our excess cash in cash equivalents. As of January 3, 2025, our cash and cash equivalents were $258,901,000 as compared to $187,150,000 at December 29, 2023. We believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding commitments, stock repurchases, dividends and other liquidity requirements over at least the next 12 months.

Generally, our net cash provided by operating activities is used to fund our day to day operating activities. First quarter operating cash requirements are generally higher due to payment in the first quarter of our annual bonuses accrued during the prior year. Our largest source of operating cash flows is collections from our clients. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, leased facilities, taxes, and general operating expenses.

The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2024 as compared to 2023 was due to a decrease in capital expenditures primarily due to leasehold improvements during 2023 associated with our office and lab space in Philadelphia.

The decrease in net cash used in financing activities during 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of our common stock, a reduction in payroll taxes for restricted stock units, and an increase in exercise of stock-based payment awards, partially offset by an increase in dividends.

We lease office, laboratory, and storage space in 13 states and the District of Columbia, as well as in China, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2033. On June 19, 2024, we entered into an agreement with the State of Arizona to extend our land lease for 15 years beginning on January 17, 2028. We are currently obligated to make payments under the lease of $1,009,000 per year, which obligation will continue at that level until January 16, 2028. Beginning on January 17, 2028, our payments under the lease will increase to approximately $6,183,000 per year for the 15-year extension term with adjustments to the annual rent payment in 2033 and 2038 based on the consumer price index. As a result of this extension, we added an additional right-of-use asset in exchange for an operating lease liability of $48,683,000 during the second quarter of 2024. As of January 3, 2025, the value of our obligations under operating leases was $81,477,000. See Note 12 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our lease obligations. The value of our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations was not material at January 3, 2025.

We expect to continue our investing activities, including capital expenditures. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase programs, pay dividends, procure facilities and equipment or strategically acquire professional service firms that are complementary to our business.

We maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans for the benefit of a select group of highly compensated employees. Vested amounts due under the plans of $112,646,000 were recorded as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet at January 3, 2025. Vested amounts due under the plans of $14,976,000 were recorded as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet at January 3, 2025. Company assets that are designated to fund the benefits under the plans are held in a rabbi trust and are subject to the claims of our creditors. As of January 3, 2025, invested amounts under the plans of $110,259,000 were recorded as a non-current asset on our consolidated

32

balance sheet. As of January 3, 2025, invested amounts under the plans of $17,578,000 were recorded as other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet.

As permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Regulation G, conditions for use of Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“Non-GAAP”) financial measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain Non-GAAP financial information. Generally, a Non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We closely monitor two financial measures, EBITDA and EBITDAS, which meet the definition of Non-GAAP financial measures. We define EBITDA as net income before income taxes, interest income, depreciation and amortization. We define EBITDAS as EBITDA before stock-based compensation. We regard EBITDA and EBITDAS as useful measures of operating performance and cash flow to complement operating income, net income and other GAAP financial performance measures. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and EBITDAS provide meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results. These measures are used to evaluate our financial results, develop budgets and determine employee compensation. These measures, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute or superior to, operating income, cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measure is set forth below.

The following table shows EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for 2024 and 2023:

The increase in EBITDA as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements during 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to the increase in utilization and a decrease in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses. Our utilization increased to 73% during 2024 as compared to 69% during 2023. The increase in utilization was due to demand for proactive services in the consumer electronics and utilities

industries, demand for reactive services in the utilities and medical device industries and our efforts to align resources with demand.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat
ive Disclosure about Market Risk

Exponent is exposed to interest rate risk associated with our balances of cash and cash equivalents. We manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average effective maturities in accordance with the Company’s investment policy. The maximum effective maturity of any issue in our portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments is three years and the maximum average effective maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed 12 months.

If interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the change in the fair value of our portfolio of cash equivalents would not have a material impact on our financial statements. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risk, there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.

We have foreign currency risk related to our revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British Pound, the Hong Kong Dollar, the Chinese Yuan, and the Singapore Dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect the revenues and net income of our foreign subsidiaries as expressed in U.S. dollars.

At January 3, 2025, we had net assets of approximately $24.2 million with a functional currency of the British Pound, net assets of approximately $3.5 million with a functional currency of the Hong Kong Dollar, net assets of approximately $2.3 million with a functional currency of the Chinese Yuan, and net assets of approximately $1.2 million with a functional currency of the Singapore Dollar associated with our operations in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, China, and Singapore respectively.

We also have foreign currency risk related to foreign currency transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains/(losses) on these foreign currency transactions and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities. At January 3, 2025, we had net assets denominated in the non-functional currency of approximately $13.4 million.

We do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge any foreign currency exposures. To date, the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our consolidated revenues and consolidated net income have not been material. However, our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.

(a)
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13(a)-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(b)
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance, but not absolute assurance, regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. These limitations include the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of the system and reasonable resource constraints. Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in
 Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in
 Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of January 3, 2025.

(c)
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Regis

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Exponent, Inc.:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Exponent, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of January 3, 2025 and December 29, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 3, 2025, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 3, 2025 and December 29, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 3, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2025 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance

38

with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Collectibility of accounts receivable

As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s allowance for contract losses and doubtful accounts was $6.1 million as of January 3, 2025. The Company’s accounts receivable, net was $161.4 million as of January 3, 2025 which represents 21% of total assets and 29% of revenue for the year ended January 3, 2025. As discussed in Note 1, the Company maintains allowances to estimate their ability to collect financial obligations from customers. The Company records a specific allowance in circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations.

We identified the assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable as a critical audit matter. Specifically, the specific allowance is an estimate which involves assessing the likelihood of collection of a customer’s accounts receivable by considering various factors such as communications from the customer, historical collections, and number of days accounts receivables have been outstanding. Subjective auditor judgment was involved in evaluating the relevance and reliability of the evidence obtained in evaluating these factors.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company’s assessment of the specific allowance. We investigated significant fluctuations in the specific allowance as compared to gross accounts receivable and the prior year specific allowance. For a selection of customer invoices and projects, we inquired of Company personnel to evaluate the rationale for establishing a specific allowance for certain customers and assessed the Company’s estimate of the specific customer allowance by evaluating the underlying contractual documents, historical collection trends, communications with customers, number of days accounts receivable have been outstanding, and other additional factors. We also evaluated subsequent collections occurring after the balance sheet date for the selected customer invoices and projects and considered the impact of potential subsequent events on the estimate of the specific customer allowance.

Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation
Exponent, Inc. together with its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company”) is a science and engineering consulting firm that provides solutions to complex problems. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company operates on a 52-53 week fiscal year with each year ending on the Friday closest to December 31
st
. Fiscal period 2024 included 53 weeks of activity and ended on January 3, 2025. Fiscal period 2023 included 52 weeks of activity and ended on December 29, 2023. Fiscal period 2022 included 52 weeks of activity and ended on December 30, 2022. Fiscal period 2025 is 52 weeks and will end on January 2, 2026.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, revenue recognition, allowance for contract losses and doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation, income taxes, goodwill, the useful life of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, and operating lease liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency Translation

The Company translates the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the local currency, at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The adjustment resulting from translating the financial statements of such foreign subsidiaries is included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments such as money market mutual funds, commercial paper and debt securities with original remaining maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase.
Allowances for Contract Losses and Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations or for disputes that affect the Company’s ability to fully collect amounts due. In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations or is aware of a dispute with a specific customer, a specific allowance is recorded to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected. For all other customers the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical write-offs, customer concentration, customer creditworthiness, current and forecasts of future economic conditions, aging of amounts due and changes in customer payment terms.
Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements
Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method. Buildings are depreciated over their estimated useful lives ranging from 
30 
to 
40
 years. Equipment is depreciated over its estimated useful life, which generally ranges from 
3
 to 
7
 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives, generally 
7
 years, or the term of the related lease.

45

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company has not recognized impairment losses on any long-lived assets in 2024, 2023 or 2022.
Goodwill
The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment review is completed during the fourth quarter of each year. The Company evaluates goodwill for each reporting unit for impairment by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company considers events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, changes in strategy, changes in customers, a change in the composition or carrying amount of a reporting unit’s net assets and changes in the price of its common stock. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not performed.

The Company completed its annual assessment for all reporting units with goodwill for 2024 and determined, after assessing the totality of the qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying amount. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment of goodwill for any of the Company’s reporting units and the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not performed. The Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment losses in 2024, 2023 or 2022.

Deferred Revenues
Deferred revenues represent amounts billed to clients in advance of services provided.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from changes in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. An uncertain tax position is recognized if it is determined that it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties are insignificant at January 3, 2025 and December 29, 2023.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, other assets and accounts payable. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are recorded at fair value. The carrying amount of the Company’s accounts receivable, other assets and accounts payable approximates their fair values due to their short maturities.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award. The Company accounts for forfeitures of stock-based awards when they occur.

46

Net Income Per Share
Basic per share amounts are computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted per share amounts are computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities, using the treasury stock method if their effect would be dilutive.
The following schedule reconciles the denominators of the Company’s calculation for basic and diluted net income per share:

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

On November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): 
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. This standard improves reportable segment disclosures by adding and enhancing interim disclosure requirements, clarifying circumstances in which entities can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, providing new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a 
single
 reportable segment, and adding the disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker within each reported measure of segment profit and loss. This standard is effective for all entities that are subject to Topic 280, Segment Reporting for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company has included all required disclosures within its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 17 for further information on segment disclosures.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (subtopic 220-40)
, which requires disclosure of disaggregation of certain relevant expenses included in the statements of operations on an annual and interim basis. ASU 2024-03 will be effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2027 and interim periods beginning January 1, 2028. The amendments must be applied retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of adoption on our consolidated financial statements.

Note 2: Revenue Recognition

Substantially all of the Company’s engagements are performed under time and materials or fixed-price arrangements. For time and materials contracts, the Company utilizes the practical expedient under Accounting Standards Codification 606 – 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, which states, if an entity has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the entity’s performance completed to date (for example, a service contract in which an entity bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided), the entity may recognize revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice.

The following table discloses the percent of the Company’s revenue generated from time and materials contracts:

For fixed-price contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. The customer typically controls the work in process as evidenced either by contractual termination clauses or by the Company’s rights to payment for work performed to date to deliver services that do not have an alternative use to the Company. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized based on the relationship of incurred labor hours at standard rates to the Company’s estimate of the total labor hours at standard rates it expects to incur over the term of the contract. The Company believes this methodology achieves a reliable measure of the revenue from the consulting services it provides to its customers under fixed-price contracts given the nature of the consulting services the Company provides.

Deferred revenues represent amounts billed to clients in advance of services provided. During 2024, $
14,173,000
 of revenues were recognized that were included in the deferred revenue balance at December 29, 2023. During 2023, $
14,463,000
 of revenues were recognized that were included in the deferred revenue balance at December 30, 2022. During 2022, $
15,384,000
 of revenues were recognized that were included in the deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2021.
Reimbursements, including those related to travel and other out-of-pocket expenses, and other similar third-party costs such as the cost of materials and certain subcontracts, are included in revenues, and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses are included in operating expenses. Any service fee associated with reimbursable expenses is included in revenues before reimbursements. The Company reports revenues net of subcontractor fees for certain subcontracts where the Company has determined that it is acting as an agent because its performance obligation is to arrange for and not control the provision of goods or services by another party. The total amount of subcontractor fees not included in revenues because the Company was acting as an agent were $
10,970,000
, $
12,268,000
 and $
28,754,000
 during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Note 4: Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including available-for-sale fixed income securities, trading fixed income and equity securities held in its deferred compensation plan and the liability associated with its deferred compensation plan. There have been no transfers between fair value measurement levels during 2024, 2023 and 2022. Any transfers between fair value measurement levels would be recorded on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. 
The fair value of these certain financial assets and liabilities was determined using the following inputs at January 3, 2025 (in thousands):

The Company is entitled to a deduction for federal and state tax purposes with respect to employees’ stock award activity. The net reduction in taxes otherwise payable arising from that deduction has been recorded as an income tax benefit. For 2024, 2023 and 2022, the net reduction in tax payable arising from employees’ stock award activity was $
2,793,000
, $
3,620,000
 and $

Note 9: Stock-Based Compensation
On May 29, 2008, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The 2008 Equity Incentive Plan and ESPP were previously adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors on April 8, 2008, subject to stockholder approval.

55

The 2008 Equity Incentive Plan allows for the award of stock options, stock awards (including stock units, stock grants and stock appreciation rights or other similar equity awards) and cash awards to officers, employees, consultants and non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The total number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan was 
13,336,300
 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment resulting from a stock split or the payment of a stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of the Company’s stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company. As of January 3, 2025, 
2,313,565
 shares were available for grant under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan.
The ESPP allows for officers and employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 
15
% of a participant’s eligible compensation. Shares of common stock are purchased under the ESPP at 
95
% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on each purchase date. Subject to adjustment resulting from a stock split or the payment of a stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of the Company’s stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, the total number of shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP was 
1,200,000
 shares of common stock. As of January 3, 2025, 
275,324
 shares were available for grant. Weighted average purchase prices for shares sold under the ESPP plan in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
88.70
, $
87.12
 and $
91.17
, respectively.
Restricted Stock Units
The Company grants restricted stock units to employees and outside directors. These restricted stock unit grants are designed to attract and retain employees, and to better align employee interests with those of the Company’s stockholders. For a select group of employees, up to 
40
% of their annual bonus is settled with fully vested restricted stock unit awards. Under these fully vested restricted stock unit awards, the holder of each award has the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock for each fully vested restricted stock unit 
four years
 from the date of grant. Each individual who received a fully vested restricted stock unit award is granted a matching number of unvested restricted stock unit awards. These unvested restricted stock unit awards cliff vest 
four years
 from the date of grant, at which time the holder of each award will have the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock for each restricted stock unit award, provided the holder of each award has met certain employment conditions. In the case of retirement at 
59 ½
 years or older, all unvested restricted stock unit awards will continue to vest provided the holder of each award performs all consulting work through the Company and does not become an employee for a past or present client, beneficial party or competitor of the Company.
All restricted stock units granted have dividend equivalent rights (“DER”), which entitle holders of restricted stock units to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DER are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested restricted stock units. DER are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest and are forfeited if the underlying shares are forfeited.
The value of these restricted stock unit awards is determined based on the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The value of fully vested restricted stock unit awards issued is recorded as a reduction to accrued bonuses. The portion of bonus expense that the Company expects to settle with fully vested restricted stock unit awards is recorded as stock-based compensation during the period the bonus is earned. For 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense associated with accrued bonus awards of $
12,182,000
, $
10,445,000
 and $
10,365,000
, respectively.

The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense associated with the unvested restricted stock unit awards of $
9,634,000
, $
8,831,000
 and $
9,164,000
 during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock unit awards vested during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
21,286,000
, $
25,277,000
 and $
29,875,000
, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair values of restricted stock unit awards granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
79.59
, $
99.47
 and $
94.24
, respectively.

Stock Options
The Company currently grants stock options under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan. Options are granted for terms of 
10
 years and generally vest ratably over a 
four-year
 period from the grant date. In the case of retirement at 
59 ½
 years or older, all unvested stock options will continue to vest provided the holder of each option does all consulting work through the Company and does not become an employee for a past or present client, beneficial party, or competitor of the Company. The Company grants options at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. All stock options have DER, which entitle holders of stock options to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DER are subject to the same vesting terms as the corresponding stock options. DER are accumulated and paid in cash when the underlying stock options vest and are forfeited if the underlying stock options do not vest. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $
1,423,000

, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal year ended January 3, 2025, and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on January 3, 2025. This amount changes based on the fair-value of the Company’s stock.

57

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the award, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.
The Company used historical exercise and post-vesting forfeiture and expiration data to estimate the expected term of options granted. The historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over a period of time equal to the expected term of the options granted was used to estimate expected volatility. The risk-free interest rate used in the option-pricing model was based on United States Treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. The dividend yield assumption considers the expectation of continued declaration of dividends, offset by option holders’ DER. All stock-based payment awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.
The assumptions used to value option grants for 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:

Note 10: Retirement Plans
The Company provides a defined contribution retirement plan for its employees whereby the Company contributes to each eligible employee’s account 
7
% of the employee’s eligible salary. The employee does not need to make a contribution to the plan to be eligible for the Company’s 
7
% contribution. To be eligible under the plan, an employee must be at least 21 years of age and be either a full-time or part-time salaried employee. The 
7
% Company contribution will vest 
20
% per year for the first 
five years
 of employment and then immediately thereafter. These contributions are made to the 401(k) plan up to the statutory maximum. Any portion of the 
7
% contribution in excess of the statutory maximum is made to the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The Company’s expenses related to this plan were $
11,704,000
, $
11,867,000
 and $
10,166,000
 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Note 11: Deferred Compensation Plans
The Company maintains nonqualified deferred compensation plans for the benefit of a select group of highly compensated employees. Under these plans, participants may elect to defer up to 
100
% of their compensation. Company assets that are earmarked to pay benefits under the plans are held in a rabbi trust and are subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors. As of January 3, 2025 and December 29, 2023, invested amounts under the plans totaled $
127,837,000
 and $
115,187,000
, respectively. These assets are classified as trading securities and are recorded at fair market value with changes recorded as adjustments to miscellaneous income, net.

As of January 3, 2025 and December 29, 2023, vested amounts due under the plans totaled $
127,622,000
 and $
116,564,000
, respectively. Changes in the liability are recorded as adjustments to compensation and related expense. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized compensation expense of $
14,928,000
, $
14,315,000
 and ($
14,187,000
), respectively, as a result of changes in the market value of the trust assets with the same amount being recorded as other income, net.

Note 12: Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at the inception of the arrangement. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, current operating lease liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company does not have any finance leases as of January 3, 2025.
ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, based on the information available at commencement date, in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The amortization of operating lease ROU assets and the change in operating lease liabilities is disclosed as a single line item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
The Company leases office, laboratory, and storage space in 
13
 states and the District of Columbia, as well as in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Leases for these office, laboratory, and storage facilities have terms generally ranging between 
one
 and 
10
 years. Some of these leases include options to extend or terminate the lease, none of which are currently included in the lease term as the Company has determined that exercise of these options is not reasonably certain.
The Company has a Test and Engineering Center on 
147
 acres of land in Phoenix, Arizona. 
The Company leases this land from the state of Arizona under a 
30
-year lease agreement that expires in January of 2028 and has 
options to renew
 for 
two

15-year
 periods.
 On 
June 19, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with the State of Arizona

59

to 
extend this lease for 
15 years
 beginning on January 17, 2028. The Company is currently obligated to make payments under the lease of $
1,009,000
 per year, which obligation will continue at that level until January 16, 2028. Beginning on January 17, 2028, the Company’s payments under the lease will increase to approximately $
6,183,000
 per year for the 
15-year
 extension term with adjustments to the annual rent payment in 
2033
 and 
2038
 based on the consumer price index. As a result of this extension, the Company added an additional right-of-use asset in exchange for an operating lease liability of $
48,683,000
 during the second quarter of 2024. As of January 3, 2025, the Company has determined that the exercise of the second renewal option is not reasonably certain and thus that extension is not included in the lease term.

The Company’s equipment leases are included in the ROU asset and liability balances, but are not material.
