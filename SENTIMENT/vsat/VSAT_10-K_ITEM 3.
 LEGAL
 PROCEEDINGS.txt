 LEGAL
 PROCEEDINGS

Periodically, we are involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including government investigations and claims, and other claims and proceedings with respect to intellectual property, breach of contract, labor and employment, tax and other matters. Such matters could result in fines; penalties, compensatory, treble or other damages; or non-monetary relief. A violation of government contract laws and regulations could also result in the termination of our government contracts or debarment from bidding on future government contracts. Although claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of our current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular period. For further information on the risks we face from existing and future claims, suits, investigations and proceedings, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Company Overview

We are an innovative, global provider of communications technologies and services, focused on making connectivity accessible, available and secure for current and future customers worldwide. By leveraging our own satellite fleet and its advantages, existing national operator partnerships, plus coverage and capacity from leading third-party satellites and constellations, our services are designed to provide customers with the essential capacity density, market access, speed, bandwidth and responsiveness they need. Our end-to-end multi-band platform of satellites, ground infrastructure and user terminals enables us to provide a wide array of cost-effective, high-quality broadband, narrowband and other connectivity solutions to aviation, maritime, enterprise, consumer, military and government users around the globe, whether on the ground, in the air or at sea. In addition, our government business includes a portfolio of communications gateways; situational awareness and command and control products and services; satellite communication products and services across various frequency bands; and cybersecurity and information assurance products and services. We believe that our diversification strategy—anchored in a broad portfolio of customer-centric products and services and supported by our fleet of broadband and narrowband satellites—our vertical integration and our ability to effectively cross-deploy technologies between government and commercial applications and segments as well as across different geographic markets, provide us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in advanced communications and networking technologies. We conduct our business through two segments: communication services and defense and advanced technologies. We changed our segment reporting structure at the beginning of fiscal year 2025, and accordingly our results of operations for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 have been recast to reflect this new reporting structure in this report.
Communication Services

Our communication services segment provides a wide range of broadband and narrowband communications solutions across government and commercial mobility markets, as well as for residential and enterprise fixed broadband customers. In addition, this segment includes the development and sale of a wide array of advanced satellite and wireless products and terminals that support or enable the provision of fixed and mobile broadband and narrowband services. We design, develop and produce space system solutions for multiple orbital regimes, including GEO, MEO and LEO.

Factors and Trends Affecting our Results of Operations
We believe that the performance of our business and our results of operations in a given period are driven by various factors, including:
•
increasing levels of competition in the markets in which we compete;
•
the extent and stage of our satellite design, construction and launch activities, the associated level of investment required, the impact of any construction or launch delays, operational or launch failures or satellite anomalies or deployment issues, and the impact of bringing newly launched satellites into commercial service and associated ramp-up activities and costs (see the discussion below under “Satellite-Related Activities”); 
•
our ability to manage available bandwidth ahead of new satellites entering commercial service;
•
our ability to maintain the health, capacity, control and level of service of our satellite fleet, or the existence or occurrence of any malfunctions or anomalies in or other disruptions to our satellites;
•
the availability of third-party satellite bandwidth and network infrastructure that we rely on to provide our services;
•
the extent of growth in uptake of our in-flight services by commercial airlines and business jets, the number of aircraft retrofitted or installed with our IFC systems, and the rate of revenue growth in our IFC-related businesses in our communication services segment, as well as the impact of the grounding or slowdown in manufacture of aircraft related to aircraft safety, maintenance, OEM delays or other issues;
•
the rate of growth in worldwide demand for mobile and fixed broadband connectivity, including growth in the number of aircraft and vessels in service, passengers, internet users, applications and connected devices;
•
the rate of technological innovation and change in the industries in which we operate, and the introduction of new competing technologies, products and services by new and existing competitors; 

45

•
the global business environment and economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, credit conditions, debt levels, consumer confidence, discretionary spending levels, rates of inflation, unemployment rates, energy costs, geopolitical issues, tariffs and other macro-economic factors;
•
changes in the levels of our R&D spending, including the effects of associated tax credits;
•
the timing and impact of acquisitions and divestitures (such as the Inmarsat Acquisition) and transaction-related or integration costs and any incurrence or repayment of indebtedness in connection therewith;
•
seasonal effects related to the timing of contract awards, the timing and availability of U.S. Government funding, and the timing of product deliveries and customer acceptance, as well as increased demand for IFC services from airline passengers during peak holiday and summer travel periods and subscriber activity for our fixed broadband services related to traditional retail selling periods in our communication services segment;
•
the marketing and pricing strategies of our competitors with respect to competing technologies, products and services;
•
our ability to implement (on a timely basis) our technology roadmap and the associated investments and costs, as well as market acceptance and the timing of availability of our new products and services;
•
the timing, quantity and mix of products and services sold in each of our segments;
•
the complex and lengthy procurement process for many of our customers, particularly in our government satcom business and defense and advanced technologies segment, the impact of a failure to receive an expected order or a deferral of an order to a later period, and the timing of or effect of delays in obtaining government product certifications;
•
the difficulty in estimating costs over the life of a contract, which may require adjustment in future periods, and the impact of cost overruns (due to inflation or otherwise) on fixed-price development contracts;
•
the timing of customer payments under significant contracts;
•
our reliance on a few significant customers, particularly agencies of the U.S. Government, for a significant percentage of our revenues, as a result of which the loss or decline in business with any of these customers may negatively impact our revenue and collectability of related accounts receivable;
•
our reliance on a global supply chain, including contract manufacturers and single-source or limited groups of suppliers; the impact of supply chain bottlenecks, and our ability to purchase or favorably price component parts that are periodically subject to shortages or supply chain disruptions resulting from surges in demand, natural disasters, tariffs, wars and other conflicts or other events;
•
varying subscriber addition, churn and average revenue per user (ARPU) rates for our fixed broadband businesses and mix of wholesale and retail subscribers;
•
one-time charges to operating income arising from items such as costs and expenses, relating to acquisitions or divestitures, impairment of assets and write-offs of assets related to customer non-payments or obsolescence;
•
changes in laws, regulations and interpretations affecting our business, including changes affecting spectrum availability or permitted uses; 
•
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to repay our indebtedness; and
•
the impact of public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the return to normalization after associated disruptions, such as the timing of return to normalization of government acquisition processes and pre-pandemic global airline traffic levels following COVID-19-related disruptions.
We may see some negative impacts on revenues and operating cash flows from our aviation businesses in fiscal year 2026 and potentially beyond, as a result of the impacts of regulatory oversight, approvals for new model aircraft and lingering global supply chain issues on the timely deliveries of aircraft to our commercial airline customers.
See also “Business–Segments” in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a discussion of what we believe to be key drivers for future growth in each of our segments.

Inmarsat Acquisition
On May 30, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Connect Topco Limited, a private company limited by shares and incorporated in Guernsey (Inmarsat Holdings and, together with its subsidiaries, Inmarsat), in exchange for approximately $550.7 million in cash and 46.36 million shares of our common stock (the Inmarsat Acquisition).
The assets and results of operations of Inmarsat are included in our communication services segment for the period following the closing of the Inmarsat Acquisition on May 30, 2023.
Sale of Link-16 TDL Business
On January 3, 2023, we completed the sale of certain assets and assigned certain liabilities comprising our Link-16 TDL Business to L3Harris in exchange for approximately $1.96 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Unless otherwise noted, discussion throughout this Item 7 relates to our continuing operations only and excludes the Link-16 TDL Business. See Note 5 — Discontinued Operations to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Satellite-Related Activities
Our complementary fleet of 23 in service or operational satellites spans the Ka-, L- and S-bands, enabling us to provide a wide array of high-quality broadband and narrowband services with near global coverage (including strong oceanic coverage) with greater redundancy and resiliency.
We launched the first of our third-generation ViaSat-3 class satellites, ViaSat-3 F1, into orbit on April 30, 2023, and on July 12, 2023, we reported a reflector deployment issue that materially impacted the performance of the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite. On August 24, 2023, we reported that the I-6 F2 satellite, which was launched in February 2023, suffered a power subsystem anomaly during its orbit raising phase, and concluded that the satellite would not operate as intended. See Note 1 — The Company and a Summary of Its Significant Accounting Policies — Property, equipment and satellites to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
We expect to continue to invest in IR&D as we continue our focus on leadership and innovation in satellite and space technologies, including for the development of any new generation satellite designs and next-generation satellite network solutions. The level of our investment in a given fiscal year will depend on a variety of factors, including the stage of development of our satellite projects, new market opportunities and our overall operating performance. By leveraging our own satellite fleet and its unique advantages, existing national operator partnerships, plus coverage and capacity from leading third-party satellites and constellations, our services are designed to provide customers with the essential capacity density, market access, speed, bandwidth and responsiveness they need. Importantly, we have continued to innovate advanced multi-orbit resource management techniques to reduce costs and expand geographic coverage to better serve the unique needs of each mobility and defense customer.  In forming key partnerships with multiple GSO and NGSO operators, we are well-positioned to support delivery of Viasat’s next-generation services, achieve industry-leading resource utilization, and drive capital efficiency. In parallel, we are working to ensure equitable access to finite space resources and support regulatory certainty enabling multi-orbit solutions and related infrastructure to thrive in a shared and sustainable way.
As we continue to build and expand our global network and satellite fleet, from time to time we enter into satellite construction agreements for the construction and purchase of additional satellites and (depending on the satellite design) the integration of our payload and technologies into the satellites. See Note 14 — Commitments to our consolidated financial statements for information as of March 31, 2025 regarding our future minimum payments under our satellite construction contracts and other satellite-related purchase commitments (including satellite performance incentive obligations) for the next five fiscal years and thereafter . The total project cost to bring a new satellite into service will depend, among other things, on the scope and timing of the earth station infrastructure roll-out and the method used to procure fiber or other access to the earth station infrastructure. Our total cash funding of a satellite project may be reduced through third-party agreements, such as potential joint service offerings and other strategic partnering arrangements.

47

In connection with the launch of any new satellite and the commencement of commercial service on the satellite, we expect to incur additional operating costs that negatively impact our financial results. For example, when ViaSat-2 was placed in commercial service in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, this resulted in additional operating costs during the ramp-up period prior to service launch and in the fiscal year following service launch. These increased operating costs included depreciation, amortization of capitalized software development, earth station connectivity, marketing and advertising costs, logistics, customer care and various support systems. In addition, interest expense increased during fiscal year 2019 as we no longer capitalized the interest expense relating to the debt incurred for the construction of ViaSat-2 and the related gateway and networking equipment once the satellite was in commercial service. As services using the new satellite scaled, however, our revenue base for broadband services expanded and we gained operating cost efficiencies, which together yielded incremental segment earnings contributions. We anticipate that we will incur a similar cycle of increased operating costs and constrained bandwidth supply as we prepare for and launch commercial services on future satellites, including our ViaSat-3 constellation, followed by increases in revenue base and in scale. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in significantly increasing revenues or achieving or maintaining operating profit in our communication services segment, and any such gains may also be offset by investments in our global business. In addition, we may experience capacity constraints on our existing satellites in the lead-up to the commencement of commercial service on new satellites, such as the capacity constraints we have been experiencing since fiscal year 2023 pending our ViaSat-3 constellation entering commercial service.
Sources of Revenues

Our communication services segment revenues are primarily derived from our aviation services (including IFC services), government satcom services, maritime services (including narrowband and safety of communication capabilities), fixed broadband services, and energy services, as well as a wide array of advanced satellite and wireless products, networks and terminal solutions that support or enable the provision of fixed and mobile broadband and narrowband services.
Our defense and advanced technologies segment revenues are primarily derived from our information security and cyber defense, space and mission systems, tactical networking, and advanced technologies and other, products and services, which are provided to government and commercial customers.
Our revenues are primarily derived from two types of contracts: fixed-price and cost-reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts (which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a specified price) comprised approximately 96%, 95% and 93% of our total revenues for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a majority of which were reported in our communication services segment. The remainder of our revenues for such periods was derived primarily from cost-reimbursement contracts (under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract, plus a fee or profit), which contracts were mainly reported within our defense and advanced technologies segment.
Historically, a portion of our revenues has been derived from customer contracts that include the development of products, mainly reported within the defense and advanced technologies segment. The development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer’s specific requirements and, accordingly, expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding (which includes a profit component) is included in revenues. See Note 1 — The Company and a Summary of Its Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
To date, our ability to grow and maintain our revenues in each of our communication services and defense and advanced technologies segments has depended on our ability to identify and target markets where the customer places a high priority on the technology solution, and our ability to obtain additional sizable contract awards. Due to the nature of this process, it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining awards in these markets.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment.

Revenue recognition

We apply the five-step revenue recognition model under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (commonly referred to as ASC 606) to our contracts with our customers. Under this model, we (1) identify the contract with the customer, (2) identify our performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price for the contract, (4) allocate the transaction price to our performance obligations and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligations. These performance obligations generally include the purchase of services (including broadband capacity and the leasing of broadband equipment), the purchase of products, and the development and delivery of complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts. Taxes imposed by governmental authorities on our revenues, such as sales taxes and value added taxes, are excluded from net sales.
The timing of satisfaction of performance obligations may require judgment. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts with customers for services, primarily consisting of connectivity services. These contracts typically require advance or recurring monthly payments by the customer. Our obligation to provide connectivity services is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. The measure of progress over time is based upon either a period of time (e.g., over the estimated contractual term) or usage (e.g., bandwidth used/bytes of data processed). We evaluate whether broadband equipment provided to our customers as part of the delivery of connectivity services represents a lease in accordance with the authoritative guidance for leases (ASC 842). As discussed in Note 1 — The Company and a Summary of Its Significant Accounting Policies — Leases to our consolidated financial statements, for broadband equipment leased to customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, we account for the lease and non-lease components of connectivity service arrangements as a single performance obligation as the connectivity services represent the predominant component.
We also derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with customers to provide products. Performance obligations to provide products are satisfied at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer. These contracts typically require payment by the customer upon passage of control and determining the point at which control is transferred may require judgment. To identify the point at which control is transferred to the customer, we consider indicators that include, but are not limited to, whether (1) we have the present right to payment for the asset, (2) the customer has legal title to the asset, (3) physical possession of the asset has been transferred to the customer, (4) the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and (5) the customer has accepted the asset. For product revenues, control generally passes to the customer upon delivery of goods to the customer.

49

Our contracts with the U.S. Government typically are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. Government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. Government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments based on a percentage of the costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer can often retain a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. Government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as receivables on the balance sheet. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. For our U.S. Government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our actual costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. Government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. We recognize a liability for these advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues on the balance sheet. An advance payment is not typically considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.
Performance obligations related to developing and delivering complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts are recognized over time as these performance obligations do not create assets with an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance to date. To measure the transfer of control, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Estimating the total costs at completion of a performance obligation requires management to make estimates related to items such as subcontractor performance, material costs and availability, labor costs and productivity and the costs of overhead. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized in the period the loss is determined. A one percent variance in our future cost estimates on open fixed-price contracts as of March 31, 2025 would change our income (loss) before income taxes by an insignificant amount.
The evaluation of transaction price, including the amounts allocated to performance obligations, may require significant judgments. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue, and, where applicable, the cost at completion, is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Our contracts may contain award fees, incentive fees, or other provisions, including the potential for significant financing components, that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These amounts, which are sometimes variable, can be dictated by performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets, the timing of payments, and customer discretion. We estimate variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. In the event an agreement includes embedded financing components, we recognize interest expense or interest income on the embedded financing components using the effective interest method. This methodology uses an implied interest rate which reflects the incremental borrowing rate which would be expected to be obtained in a separate financing transaction. We have elected the practical expedient not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.

50

If a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Estimating standalone selling prices may require judgment. When available, we utilize the observable price of a good or service when we sell that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the standalone selling price by considering all information (including market conditions, specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably available.
Deferred costs to obtain or fulfill contract

Under ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs — Contracts with Customers, we recognize an asset from the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect to recover those costs. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that we incur to obtain a contract with a customer that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. ASC 340-40 also requires the recognition of an asset from the costs incurred to fulfill a contract when (1) the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify, (2) the costs generate or enhance our resources that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future, and (3) the costs are expected to be recovered. We recognize an asset related to commission costs incurred primarily in our communication services segment and recognize an asset related to costs incurred to fulfill contracts. Costs to acquire customer contracts are amortized over the estimated customer contract life. Costs to fulfill customer contracts are amortized in proportion to the revenue to which the costs relate. For contracts with an estimated amortization period of less than one year, we expense incremental costs immediately.
Property, equipment and satellites

Property, equipment and satellites, net includes our owned and leased satellites and the associated earth stations and networking equipment, as well as the customer premise equipment units which are leased to customers as part of our communication services segment.

Satellites and other property and equipment are recorded at cost or in the case of certain satellites and other property acquired, the fair value at the date of acquisition, net of accumulated depreciation. Capitalized satellite costs consist primarily of the costs of satellite construction and launch, including launch insurance and insurance during the period of in-orbit testing, the net present value of performance incentive payments expected to be payable to the satellite manufacturers (dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellites), costs directly associated with the monitoring and support of satellite construction, and interest costs incurred during the period of satellite construction. We also construct earth stations, network operations systems and other assets to support our satellites, and those construction costs, including interest, are capitalized as incurred. At the time satellites are placed in commercial service, we estimate the useful life of our satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellite’s performance against the original manufacturer’s orbital design life, estimated fuel levels and related consumption rates, as well as historical satellite operating trends. We periodically review the remaining estimated useful life of our satellites to determine if revisions to the estimated useful lives are necessary.
Leases
In accordance with ASC 842, we assess at contract inception whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Generally, we determine that a lease exists when (1) the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) we obtain the right to substantially all economic benefits from use of the asset, and (3) we have the right to direct the use of the asset. A lease is classified as a finance lease when one or more of the following criteria are met: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, (2) the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset, (4) the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset or (5) the asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any of these criteria.

51

At the lease commencement date, we recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, except short-term leases with an original term of 12 months or less. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, less any lease incentives received. All right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment in accordance with standards that apply to long-lived assets. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using an estimate of our incremental borrowing rate for a collateralized loan with the same term as the underlying leases.

Lease payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities consist of (1) fixed lease payments for the noncancelable lease term, (2) fixed lease payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal option will be exercised, and (3) variable lease payments that depend on an underlying index or rate, based on the index or rate in effect at lease commencement. Certain of our real estate lease agreements require variable lease payments that do not depend on an underlying index or rate established at lease commencement. Such payments and changes in payments based on a rate or index are recognized in operating expenses when incurred.

Lease expense for operating leases consists of the fixed lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term plus variable lease payments as incurred. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the depreciation of assets obtained under finance leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense on the lease liability based on the discount rate at lease commencement. For both operating and finance leases, lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense.
For broadband equipment leased to customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, we have made an accounting policy election not to separate the broadband equipment from the related connectivity services. The connectivity services are the predominant component of these arrangements. The connectivity services are accounted for in accordance ASC 606. We are also a lessor for certain insignificant communications equipment. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.
Business combinations
The purchase price for business combinations is allocated to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets, and assumed liabilities, where applicable. Additionally, we recognize technology, contracts and customer relationships, orbital slots and spectrum assets, trade names and other as identifiable intangible assets, which are recorded at fair value as of the transaction date. Goodwill is recorded when consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities. Measurement-period adjustments to assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill are recorded in the period they occur, which may include up to one year from the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date.

Impairment of long-lived and other long-term assets (property, equipment and satellites, and other assets, including goodwill)

In accordance with the authoritative guidance for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets (ASC 360), we assess potential impairments to our long-lived assets, including property, equipment and satellites and other assets, when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset (or group of assets) are less than the asset’s carrying value. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations. Except for the impairment related to our exit from certain locations in EMEA markets, disposal of certain related assets and termination of certain related long-term contracts in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the impairment related to certain of our satellites under construction and satellite programs in the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2024 (as discussed in Note 1 — The Company and a Summary of Its Significant Accounting Policies — Property, equipment and satellites below), and the impairment of certain right-of-use assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, no other material impairments were recorded by us for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023. See Note 7 — Leases to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

52

We account for our goodwill under the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets (ASC 350). Current authoritative guidance allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying value, we conclude that no impairment exists. Alternatively, if we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, then we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test to identify both the existence of an impairment and the amount of impairment loss, by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist.

In accordance with ASC 350, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is impaired. The qualitative analysis includes assessing the impact of changes in certain factors including: (1) changes in forecasted operating results and comparing actual results to projections, (2) changes in the industry or our competitive environment since the acquisition date, (3) changes in the overall economy, our market share and market interest rates since the acquisition date, (4) trends in the stock price and related market capitalization and enterprise values, (5) trends in peer companies’ total enterprise value metrics, and (6) additional factors such as management turnover, changes in regulation and changes in litigation matters.
Furthermore, in addition to qualitative analysis, we believe it is appropriate to conduct a quantitative analysis periodically as a prudent review of our reporting unit goodwill fair values. Our quantitative analysis estimates the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows and other indicators of fair value. The forecast of future cash flow is based on our best estimate of each reporting unit’s future revenue and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor resources, general market conditions, successful launch of our satellites currently under construction and other relevant factors. Based on a quantitative analysis for fiscal year 2025, we concluded that estimated fair values of our reporting units exceed their respective carrying values.
Based on our qualitative and quantitative assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their related carrying value as of March 31, 2025.

Income taxes and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets

Management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis to determine if the weight of available evidence suggests that an additional valuation allowance is needed. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes (ASC 740), net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on all the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the event that our estimate of taxable income is less than that required to utilize the full amount of any deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is established, which would cause a decrease to income in the period such determination is made.
Our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets considered historical as well as forecasted future operating results, the reversal of temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted), and the availability of tax planning strategies. Additionally, in our analysis, we also considered the fact that ASC 740 places more weight on the objectively verifiable evidence of current pre-tax losses and recent events than forecasts of future profitability.

Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with ASC 740. Under the authoritative guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The authoritative guidance addresses the derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures.

53

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of business, there are calculations and transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, changes in tax laws and regulations as well as adverse judicial rulings could adversely affect the income tax provision. We believe we have adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal, state and foreign tax authorities. However, if these provided amounts prove to be more than what is necessary, the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine that provision for the liabilities is no longer necessary. If an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, an additional charge to expense would result.

After excluding these net losses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by $23.5 million, primarily driven by a $50.2 million increase in support costs and partially offset by a $24.7 million decrease in sales and marketing costs, both of which were mainly in our communication services segment. SG&A expenses consisted primarily of personnel costs and expenses for business development, marketing and sales, bid and proposal, acquisition and transaction related expenses, facilities, finance, contract administration and general management.

Amortization of acquired intangible assets

We amortize our acquired intangible assets from prior acquisitions over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to 12 years. The $36.8 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal year 2025 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily related to a full year of amortization of acquired intangibles as a result of the Inmarsat Acquisition in May 2023, compared to only ten months in the prior year period. Expected amortization expense for acquired intangible assets for each of the following periods is as follows:

Interest income

The $12.3 million decrease in interest income for fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 was primarily due to the interest income received from a litigation settlement in the prior year period (see Note 15 — Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements) and the lower interest earned as a result of lower average invested balance in combination with lower interest rate.
Interest expense

The $21.5 million increase in interest expense in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 was primarily the result of the effects of increased interest expense arising from our increased level of indebtedness following the closing of the Inmarsat Acquisition in May 2023 and the refinancing of certain debt at a higher interest rate.

Income taxes
The income tax benefit in fiscal year 2025 primarily reflected the tax benefit from our loss before income taxes, partially offset by a valuation allowance recorded against our U.S. net deferred tax assets. The income tax benefit in fiscal year 2024 primarily reflected the tax benefit from our loss before income taxes, partially offset by a valuation allowance recorded against our U.S. net deferred tax assets. Our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets increased from $353.6 million at March 31, 2024 to $430.5 million at March 31, 2025. The valuation allowance relates to federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, federal and state R&D tax credit carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards.

Our communication services segment revenues increased by $156.9 million due to a $223.8 million increase in service revenues, partially offset by a $66.9 million decrease in product revenues. The Inmarsat Acquisition contributed approximately $329.6 million to the increase in service revenues in our communication services segment, as a result of a full year of contribution compared to only ten months in the prior year period coupled with higher revenues contributed by Inmarsat in the current year period. Furthermore, with respect to segment service revenues, the inclusion of a full year of contribution from Inmarsat, the Inmarsat service revenue increase year-over-year and growth in our aviation services were partially offset by an expected decrease in service revenues from fixed services and other as we continued to allocate a greater proportion of our bandwidth to our IFC business in preference to our U.S. fixed services business due to bandwidth constraints. The IFC service revenue increase was driven primarily by the increase in the number of commercial aircraft and business jets receiving our in-flight services through our IFC systems, with our IFC systems installed and in service on approximately 4,120 commercial aircraft (of which approximately 90 were inactive mostly due to standard aircraft maintenance) and approximately 2,000 business jets as of March 31, 2025, compared to approximately 3,720 commercial aircraft (of which approximately 70 were inactive at quarter end mostly due to standard aircraft maintenance) and approximately 1,800 business jets as of March 31, 2024. The decrease in segment product revenues was primarily driven by a $56.0 million decrease in aviation products, due to accelerated IFC terminal deliveries in the prior year period, and a $16.4 million decrease in government satcom.

We also experienced a $21.5 million decrease in IR&D expenses (primarily related to next-generation consumer broadband integrated networking technologies). The decrease in segment operating loss was partially offset by a $169.4 million impairment related to ground network as a result of our exit activities from certain locations in EMEA markets, recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, as well as an increase of $31.5 million in SG&A expenses (reflecting the inclusion of a full year of Inmarsat SG&A costs in the current year period compared to only ten months of Inmarsat SG&A costs in the prior year period).

Amortization of acquired intangible assets

The $197.4 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets in fiscal year 2024 compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily related to the amortization of acquired intangibles as a result of the Inmarsat Acquisition in May 2023.
Interest income

The $76.7 million increase in interest income for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to the interest earned on the invested portion of the cash related to proceeds of approximately $1.96 billion received from L3Harris in the Link-16 TDL Sale as well as cash acquired as part of the Inmarsat Acquisition.
Interest expense

The $373.6 million increase in interest expense in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily the result of the effects of increased interest expense arising from our increased level of indebtedness following the closing of the Inmarsat Acquisition in May 2023. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in the amount of interest capitalized during fiscal year 2024 compared to the prior year period.
Income taxes
The income tax benefit in fiscal year 2024 primarily reflected the tax benefit from our loss before income taxes, partially offset by a valuation allowance recorded against our U.S. net deferred tax assets. The income tax provision in fiscal year 2023 primarily reflected the establishment of a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset for California R&D tax credits and the expense for tax deficiencies upon settlement of stock-based compensation during the period, partially offset by the benefit of federal R&D tax credits. Our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets increased from $150.0 million at March 31, 2023 to $353.6 million at March 31, 2024. The valuation allowance relates to federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, federal and state R&D tax credit carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards.

The increase in our communication services segment operating loss was primarily due to the recording of satellite impairment and related charges, net of estimated insurance claim receivables of approximately $905.5 million in fiscal year 2024, as described above, as well as a $239.4 million increase in SG&A costs and a $5.4 million increase in IR&D expenses (primarily related to the inclusion of expenses related to the Inmarsat business for the period following the Inmarsat Acquisition). The increase in our segment operating loss was partially offset by higher earnings contributions of $522.7 million, mainly due to an increase in segment service revenues as a result of the Inmarsat Acquisition and improved margins in our aviation services as they continued to scale.

Our defense and advanced technologies segment revenues increased by $290.8 million due to a $251.1 million increase in product revenues and a $39.7 million increase in service revenues. The increase in segment product revenues was primarily due to increases of $120.5 million in information security and cyber defense, $57.7 million in advanced technologies and other, mainly related to higher contributions from certain licensing agreements in advanced technologies and other in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 (see Note 15 — Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for more information), $50.0 million in space and mission systems, $23.0 million in tactical networking. The increase in segment service revenues was primarily driven by increases of $18.7 million in space and mission systems, $7.4 million in tactical networking, $7.0 million in advanced technologies and other and $6.5 million in information security and cyber defense.

The firm backlog does not include contract options. As of March 31, 2025, approximately half of the firm backlog is expected to be delivered during the next 12 months, with the balance delivered thereafter. We include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders, and not anticipated purchase orders and requests. In our communication services segment, our backlog includes fixed broadband service revenues under our subscriber agreements, but does not include future recurring IFC service revenues under our agreements with commercial airlines. As of March 31, 2025, our IFC systems were installed and in service on approximately 4,120 commercial aircraft, of which approximately 90 were inactive at fiscal year end (mostly due to standard aircraft maintenance). We anticipate that approximately 1,600 additional commercial aircraft will be put into service with our IFC systems under existing customer agreements with commercial airlines. Due to the nature of commercial airline contracts, there can be no assurance that all anticipated purchase orders and requests will be placed or that anticipated IFC services will be activated on all such additional commercial aircraft.
Our total new awards which exclude future revenue under recurring consumer commitment arrangements were approximately $4.7 billion for fiscal year 2025 and $4.2 billion for fiscal year 2024.

Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales. A majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer. Orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery, and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties. In addition, purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development. A failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related contract.

Firm backlog amounts are comprised of funded and unfunded components. Funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts. Unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods. Our customers allocate funds for expenditures on long-term contracts on a periodic basis. Our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts. Although we do not control the funding of our contracts, our experience indicates that actual contract funding has ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview

We have financed our operations to date primarily with cash flows from operations, bank line of credit financing, debt financing, export credit agency financing and equity financing. At March 31, 2025, we had $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.2 billion in working capital, no outstanding borrowings and borrowing availability of $593.3 million under the Viasat Revolving Credit Facility and no outstanding borrowings and borrowing availability of $550.0 million under the Inmarsat Revolving Credit Facility. At March 31, 2024, we had $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.2 billion in working capital, no outstanding borrowings and borrowing availability of $591.5 million under the Viasat Revolving Credit Facility, and no outstanding borrowings and borrowing availability of $550.0 million under the Inmarsat Revolving Credit Facility. We invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short-term, highly liquid bank money market funds primarily investing in U.S. government-backed securities and treasuries.

63

The general cash needs of our business can vary significantly and our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors, including cash required for our satellite projects and any future broadband satellite projects we may engage in, expansion of our IR&D and marketing efforts, and the nature and timing of orders. In particular:

•
The cash needs of our communication services segment tend to be driven by the timing and amount of capital expenditures (e.g., payments under satellite construction and launch contracts and investments in ground infrastructure roll-out), the timing and amount of investments in IR&D activities (including with respect to next-generation satellite payload technologies), investments in joint ventures, strategic partnering arrangements, network expansion activities, investments to obtain STCs to enable the retrofit installation of our IFC and W-IFE equipment and investments in platforms and software to support our services and entry into new markets, as well as the quality of customer, type of contract and payment terms, and timing and amount of recoveries under satellite insurance claims.
•
In our defense and advanced technologies segment, the primary factors determining cash needs tend to be the type and mix of contracts in backlog (e.g., product or service, development or production), timing of payments and payment terms (including restrictions on the timing of cash payments under U.S. Government procurement regulations), as well as contract duration and program performance. For example, if a program is performing well and meeting its contractual requirements, then its cash flow requirements are usually lower.
Additionally, we will continue to evaluate other possible acquisitions of, or investments in complementary businesses, products and technologies which may require the use of cash or additional financing.
As a result of the divestiture of the Link-16 TDL Business, we took measures to mitigate the impact of stranded costs and to right-size our remaining businesses by reducing discretionary spending and by undertaking cost-reduction measures, including reducing our real estate footprint and workforce, which measures resulted in approximately $40 million of expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, primarily recorded in our SG&A.
In November 2023, we announced an important milestone in our integration program following our Inmarsat Acquisition. As part of our ongoing strategy to streamline operations and better serve our growing customer base, we completed our work on the rationalization of roles in our global business, which was intended to achieve both operational and cost efficiencies. As part of the role rationalization, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 800 positions, or approximately 10%, and recorded total costs (primarily related to employee severance payments, benefits and related termination costs) of approximately $48 million during fiscal year 2024. These one-time costs were recorded within operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in both of our segments.
To further enhance our liquidity position or to finance the construction and launch of any future satellites, acquisitions, strategic partnering arrangements, joint ventures or other business investment initiatives, we may obtain additional financing, which could consist of debt, convertible debt or equity financing from public and/or private credit and capital markets. From time to time, we file universal shelf registration statements with the SEC for the future sale of an unlimited amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares and warrants, which securities may be offered from time to time, separately or together, directly by us, by selling security holders, or through underwriters, dealers or agents at amounts, prices, interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Additionally, we consider strategic divestitures from time to time, such as the Link-16 TDL Sale that was completed in January 2023 for approximately $1.96 billion in cash, subject to adjustments, as well as divestitures of non-core assets or businesses, such as the divestiture of our energy services system integration business in December 2024.
We may, from time to time, seek to retire, prepay or repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. During fiscal year 2025, we repurchased $257.5 million in aggregate principal amount of Viasat’s 5.625% Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes)) in open market transactions and redeemed the Inmarsat 2026 Notes in full. As a result, in fiscal year 2025, we recorded a net loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $99.8 million in (loss) gain on extinguishment of debt, net, mainly related to the redemption of the Inmarsat 2026 Notes (attributable to the related unamortized fair value adjustment made in purchase accounting). Subsequent to fiscal year end, we redeemed all remaining 2025 Notes in full. Although we can give no assurances concerning our future liquidity, we believe that we have adequate sources of funding to meet our anticipated operating requirements for the next 12 months, which include, but are not limited to, cash on hand, borrowing capacity, and cash expected to be provided by operating activities.

64

Cash flows

Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2025 was $908.2 million compared to $688.2 million for fiscal year 2024. This $220.0 million increase was driven by a $211.7 million year-over-year decrease in cash used to fund net operating assets and our operating results (net income (loss) adjusted for depreciation, amortization and other non-cash charges) which resulted in $8.3 million of higher cash provided by operating activities year-over-year. The decrease in cash used to fund net operating assets during fiscal year 2025 when compared to the prior year period was primarily due to timing of payments related to our income tax payables, accrued liabilities and accounts payable. Cash paid for income taxes, net, during fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was $196.3 million and $200.6 million, respectively. Cash paid for interest (net of amounts capitalized) during fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was $390.0 million and $229.0 million, respectively.
Cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2025 was $758.4 million compared to $1.3 billion for fiscal year 2024. This $532.8 million decrease in cash used in investing activities year-over-year reflected a decrease of $509.2 million in cash used for capital expenditures as well as the $342.6 million in cash (net of cash acquired) used for the Inmarsat Acquisition in fiscal year 2024, partially offset by a $257.1 million decrease in cash receipts related to satellite insurance claim proceeds year-over-year.

Cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2025 was $442.6 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2024. Cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2025 was primarily comprised of debt repayments of $2.4 billion, partially offset by proceeds from debt borrowings of $2.0 billion (which primarily related to the repurchase and refinancing of the Inmarsat 2026 Notes). Cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2024 was primarily comprised of proceeds from debt borrowings of approximately $1.7 billion primarily incurred in connection with the Inmarsat Acquisition, partially offset by debt repayments of $567.0 million. See Note 8 — Senior Notes and Other Long-Term Debt for further information.

Capital Expenditures and IR&D Investments
Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2025 of $1.0 billion were 33% lower than fiscal year 2024, reflecting efforts to continue to optimize our capital expenditures as we integrate our businesses and prioritize our investments. Our total capital expenditures in fiscal year 2026 may be slightly higher compared to fiscal year 2025, due to timing, however we expect to continue to manage investments in our business as a whole and remain committed to meaningfully reducing aggregate capital expenditures as part of our Inmarsat integration strategy and as satellites currently under construction are completed. See Note 14 — Commitments to our consolidated financial statements for information as of March 31, 2025 regarding our future minimum payments under our satellite construction contracts and other satellite-related purchase commitments (including satellite performance incentive obligations relating to the ViaSat-1 and ViaSat-2 satellites) for the next five fiscal years and thereafter.

We also incur IR&D expenses, which are not directly funded by a third party. IR&D expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, supplies, prototype materials, testing and certification related to R&D projects. Our IR&D investments are expected to continue through fiscal year 2026 and beyond to support our growth, acceleration of new opportunities and entry into new markets (for example direct-to-device). IR&D expenses were approximately 3%, 4% and 5% of total revenues in fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As a government contractor, we are able to recover a portion of our IR&D expenses pursuant to our government contracts.
Long-Term Debt
As of March 31, 2025, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was $7.2 billion, which was comprised of (1) $442.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes (which were redeemed in full subsequent to fiscal year end), $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Viasat's 5.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes), $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Viasat's 6.500% Senior Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes), $1.975 billion in aggregate principal amount of Inmarsat's 9.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the Inmarsat 2029 Notes) and $733.4 million in aggregate principal amount of Viasat's 7.500% Senior Notes due 2031 (the 2031 Notes), (2) $680.8 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under Viasat's $700.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the 2022 Term Loan Facility), $607.5 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under Viasat's $616.7 million senior secured term loan facility (the 2023 Term Loan Facility), $1.6 billion in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under Inmarsat's $1.6 billion senior secured term loan facilities (the Inmarsat Term Loan Facilities), no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities, and $19.7 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under Viasat's direct loan facility with the Export-Import Bank of the United States (the Ex-Im Credit Facility), and (3) $158.5 million of finance lease obligations. For information regarding our outstanding indebtedness, refer to Note 8 — Senior Notes and Other Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements.

We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several subcontractors and contract manufacturers to provide design and manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we enter into agreements with subcontractors, contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. We also enter into agreements and purchase commitments with suppliers for the construction, launch, and operation of our satellites. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Consequently, only a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancelable and unconditional commitments. We may also cancel, reschedule or adjust our requirements based on business needs after firm orders are placed at a cost, which may be material.
Our consolidated balance sheets included $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion of “other liabilities” as of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively, which primarily consisted of deferred income taxes and the long-term portion of deferred revenues. These remaining liabilities have been excluded from the above table as the timing and/or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at March 31, 2025 as defined in Regulation S-K Item 303(b) other than as discussed under “Contractual Obligations” above or disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

ITEM 7A.
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT
IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term and long-term obligations (including the Credit Facilities and the Notes). We consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Our indebtedness for borrowed money comprises borrowings under our Credit Facilities and the aggregate principal amount outstanding under our Notes. The Notes and borrowings under our Ex-Im Credit Facility bear interest at a fixed rate and therefore our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our remaining Credit Facilities, cash equivalents and short-term obligations.

The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. To minimize this risk, we maintain a significant amount of our cash balance in money market accounts, with a significant portion held in U.S. government-backed securities and treasuries. In general, money market accounts are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our cash and cash equivalents earn interest at variable rates. Our interest income has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by low market interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Because our investment policy restricts us to invest in conservative, interest-bearing investments and because our business strategy does not rely on generating material returns from our investment portfolio, we do not expect our market risk exposure on our investment portfolio to be material. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe an immediate 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. We therefore do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates.

Our primary interest rate under our variable rate Credit Facilities is the forward-looking term SOFR rate plus an applicable margin. As of March 31, 2025, the effective interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan Facility was 9.47% and under the 2023 Term Loan Facility was 9.93%. As of March 31, 2025, the weighted average effective interest rate under the Inmarsat Term Loan Facilities was approximately 9.17%. As of March 31, 2024, the effective interest rate that would have been applied to any new SOFR-based borrowings under the Viasat Revolving Credit Facility was approximately 7.05%, and under the Inmarsat Revolving Credit Facility was approximately 7.07%. As of March 31, 2025, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities. Accordingly, assuming the outstanding balance under the 2022 Term Loan Facility, the 2023 Term Loan Facility and the Inmarsat Term Loan Facilities remained constant over a year and we continued to have no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities, a 10% increase in the interest rates would increase interest incurred, prior to effects of capitalized interest, by approximately $25.5 million over a 12-month period.
Foreign Exchange Risk

We generally conduct our business in U.S. dollars. However, as our international business is conducted in a variety of foreign currencies, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A five percent variance in foreign currencies in which our international business is conducted would change our income (loss) before income taxes by an insignificant amount for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency risk is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Accordingly, from time to time, we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recorded $169.4 million in impairment charges and other liabilities related to the exit from certain locations in EMEA markets, in selling, general and administrative expenses (see Note 1 — The Company and a Summary of Its Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for more information).
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recorded a one-time benefit from a litigation settlement of $95.3 million in revenues (see Note 15 — Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for more information). Additionally, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, we recorded a reduction to the carrying value of satellites under construction of approximately $1.67 billion, which was partially offset by total insurance claim receivables of approximately $770.0 million, resulting in a net loss of approximately $905.5 million recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses (see Note 1 — The Company and a Summary of Its Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for more information).

The summarized quarterly data above includes the operating results of Inmarsat from the date of acquisition on May 30, 2023. Therefore, the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 only included one month of Inmarsat's operating results, whereas the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2024 included a full quarter of Inmarsat's operating results.
Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted net income (loss) per share.

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2025.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, as stated in their report which appears on page F-1.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. During the quarter ended March 31, 2025, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registe
red Public Accounting Firm

To the

Board of Directors and Stockholders of Viasat, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Viasat, Inc. and its subsidiaries

(the “Company”) as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related

consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2025, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15 (a)(1) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated

financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2025 and 2024
, 
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2025

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated

financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated

financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated

financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated

financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated

financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated

financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

F-

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition – Communication Services Segment

As described in Notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the communication services segment revenues were $3,298 million for the year ended March 31, 2025. The Company’s communication services segment revenues are primarily derived from the Company’s aviation services (including in-flight connectivity (IFC) services), government satcom services, maritime services (including narrowband and safety of communication capabilities), fixed broadband services, and energy services, as well as a wide array of advanced satellite and wireless products, networks and terminal solutions that support or enable the provision of fixed and mobile broadband and narrowband services. The Company’s connectivity services contracts typically require advance or recurring monthly payments by the customer. The Company’s obligation to provide connectivity services is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. The measure of progress over time is based upon either a period of time (e.g., over the estimated contractual term) or usage (e.g., bandwidth used/bytes of data processed).

The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition within the communication services segment is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the recording of the communication services revenue at the transaction price based upon either a period of time or usage. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing revenue recognized for a sample of revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as contracts, purchase orders, invoices, proof of transfer of control to the customer, and cash receipts; and (ii) confirming a sample of outstanding customer invoice balances as of March 31, 2025 and, for confirmations not returned, obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as invoices, proof of transfer of control to the customer, and subsequent cash receipts.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATE
D FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 — The Company and a Summary of Its Significant Accounting Policies

The Company

Viasat, Inc. (also referred to hereafter as the “Company” or “Viasat”) is an innovative, global provider of communications technologies and services focused on making connectivity accessible, available and secure for current and future customers worldwide.

Principles of consolidation

The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of Viasat, its wholly owned subsidiaries and its majority-owned subsidiary, TrellisWare Technologies, Inc. (TrellisWare). In fiscal year 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Connect Topco Limited, a private company limited by shares and incorporated in Guernsey (Inmarsat Holdings and, together with its subsidiaries, are referred to herein as Inmarsat, and such acquisition, the Inmarsat Acquisition). The Inmarsat Acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly, the consolidated financial statements include the operating results of Inmarsat from the date of acquisition.

All significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated. Investments in entities in which the Company can exercise significant influence, but does not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control, are accounted for using the equity method and are included as investment in unconsolidated affiliate in other assets (long-term) in the consolidated balance sheets.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Discontinued Operations
On October 1, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to sell certain assets and assign certain liabilities comprising the Company’s Link-16 Tactical Data Links business (the Link-16 TDL Business), part of the Company’s defense and advanced technologies segment, to L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (L3Harris) in exchange for approximately $
1.96
 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments
 (the Link-16 TDL Sale)
. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for discontinued operations (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-20), the Company determined that the Link-16 TDL Business met held-for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Accordingly, the Company classified the results of the Link-16 TDL Business as discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. On January 3, 2023, the Company completed the Link-16 TDL Sale. See Note 5 — Discontinued Operations for additional information.
Management estimates and assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates have been prepared on the basis of the most current and best available information and actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, patents, orbital slots and other licenses, software development, property, equipment and satellites, long-lived assets, derivatives, contingencies and income taxes including the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.

Cash equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase, with a significant portion held in U.S. government-backed securities and treasuries.

VIASAT, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts

The Company records any unconditional rights to consideration as receivables at net realizable value including an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against the reserve. Historically, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts has been minimal primarily because a significant portion of its sales has been to the U.S. Government or with respect to its satellite services commercial business, the Company bills and collects in advance.

Concentration of risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable which are generally not collateralized. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by placing its cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments with high credit quality financial institutions and investing in high quality short-term debt instruments. The Company establishes customer credit policies related to its accounts receivable based on historical collection experiences within the various markets in which the Company operates, historical past due amounts and any specific information that the Company becomes aware of such as bankruptcy or liquidity issues of customers.

Revenues from the U.S. Government as an individual customer comprised approximately 
18
%
, 
17
%
 and 
17
%
 of total revenues for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Billed accounts receivable to the U.S. Government as of March 31, 2025 and 2024
 were approximately 
11
% and 
13
%, respectively, of total billed receivables. In addition, none of the Company’s commercial customers comprised 10% or more of total revenues for fiscal years 
2025, 2024 and 2023. The Company's five largest contracts generated approximately 
18
%
, 
16
%
 and 
17
%
 of the Company’s total revenues for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company relies on a limited number of contract manufacturers to produce its products.

Inventory

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, cost being determined by the weighted average cost method.

Property, equipment and satellites

Satellites and other property and equipment, including internally developed software, are recorded at cost or, in the case of certain satellites and other property acquired, the fair value at the date of acquisition, net of accumulated depreciation. Capitalized satellite costs consist primarily of the costs of satellite construction and launch, including launch insurance and insurance during the period of in-orbit testing, the net present value of performance incentives expected to be payable to satellite manufacturers (dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellites), costs directly associated with the monitoring and support of satellite construction, and interest costs incurred during the period of satellite construction. The Company also constructs earth stations, network operations systems and other assets to support its satellites, and those construction costs, including interest, are capitalized as incurred. At the time satellites are placed in commercial service, the Company estimates the useful life of its satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellite’s performance against the original manufacturer’s orbital design life, estimated fuel levels and related consumption rates, as well as historical satellite operating trends. The Company periodically reviews the remaining estimated useful life of its satellites to determine if revisions to estimated useful lives are necessary. Costs incurred for additions to property, equipment and satellites, together with major renewals and betterments, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying asset. Costs incurred for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals and betterments are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations, which for the periods presented, primarily related to losses incurred for unreturned customer premise equipment (CPE). The Company computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 
two
 to 
38
 years. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the improvement.

F-

VIASAT, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Costs related to internally developed software for internal uses are capitalized after the preliminary project stage is complete and are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are approximately 
three
 to 
seven years
. Capitalized costs for internal-use software are included in property, equipment and satellites, net in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Interest expense is capitalized on the carrying value of assets under construction, in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the capitalization of interest (ASC 835-20).
 With respect to the construction of satellites, gateway and networking equipment and other assets under construction, the Company capitalized $
215.4
 million, $
227.5
 million and $
159.7
 million of interest expense during fiscal years 
2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company's complementary fleet of 23 in service or operational satellites spans the Ka-, L- and S- bands, with 13 Ka-band satellites, eight high-availability L-band satellites (three of which are contingency L-band satellites that are operational but not currently in commercial service), an S-band satellite that supports the European Aviation Network (EAN) to provide in-flight connectivity (IFC) services to commercial airlines in Europe, and an Inmarsat-6 class hybrid Ka-/L-band satellite (the I-6 F1 satellite). In late July 2024, the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite completed in-orbit testing and was integrated into the Company's existing satellite fleet covering the Americas. In May 2025, subsequent to fiscal year end, two Ka-band highly-elliptical earth orbit satellite payloads (GX10A and GX10B) were put in service to provide polar coverage for government customers, with commercial maritime and aviation services anticipated to follow during fiscal year 2026. Furthermore, the Company has eight additional geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites under development: two additional high-capacity Ka-band GEO satellites (ViaSat-3 F2 and ViaSat-3 F3), three additional adaptive Ka-band GEO satellites (GX 7, GX 8 and GX 9) and three Inmarsat-8 L-band GEO safety service satellites. In addition to the Company's satellite fleet, the Company has purchased capacity on and has access to additional regional partner satellites. In addition, the Company owns related earth stations and networking equipment for all of its satellites. The Company procures CPE units leased to customers in order to connect to the Company's satellite network as part of the Company’s communication services segment, which are reflected in investing activities and property, equipment and satellites, net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company depreciates the satellites, earth stations and networking equipment, CPE units and related installation costs over their estimated useful lives. The total cost and accumulated depreciation of CPE units included in property, equipment and satellites, net, as of March 31, 2025 were 
$
526.0
 million and $
328.0
 million, respectively. The total cost and accumulated depreciation of CPE units included in property, equipment and satellites, net, as of 
March 31, 2024 were 
$
567.5
 million and $
267.4
 million, respectively.
As part of the Company's continued integration of its networks and related satellite portfolio, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company determined that it would exit from certain locations in EMEA markets, dispose of certain related assets and terminate certain related long-term contracts. As a result, the Company recorded $
169.4
 million of impairment charges and other liabilities related to such exit activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 in selling, general and administrative expenses in its communication services segment in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
The Company launched the first of its third-generation ViaSat-3 class satellites, ViaSat-3 F1, into orbit on April 30, 2023. On July 12, 2023, the Company reported a reflector deployment issue that materially impacted the performance of the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite. The Company and the reflector provider conducted a rigorous review of the development and deployment of the affected reflector to determine its impact and potential remedial measures. In connection with the root cause analysis, the Company determined that while the satellite payload is functional, the Company will recover less than 
10
% of the planned throughput on the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite.
On August 24, 2023, the Company reported that the I-6 F2 satellite, which was launched on February 18, 2023, suffered a power subsystem anomaly during its orbit raising phase. The Company and Airbus, the satellite's manufacturer, performed a root cause analysis of the anomaly and concluded the satellite would not operate as intended. The Company determined that the full carrying value of the I-6 F2 satellite is not recoverable. The I-6 F2 anomaly does not impact ongoing customer services. The I-6 F1 satellite, which was launched in December 2021, is operational and continues to perform as expected.

VIASAT, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

During fiscal year 2024, as a result of the anomalies that occurred with respect to the ViaSat-3 F1 and I-6 F2 satellites as well as the impact of integration efforts related to the Inmarsat Acquisition, the Company undertook extensive analysis of its existing integrated satellite fleet and ongoing satellites under construction projects, taking into account its anticipated future capacity needs, projected capital investment profile and access to third party satellites under existing bandwidth arrangements. Based on the impairment analysis performed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, as a result of the anomalies experienced in the two satellites and integration impact related to the Inmarsat Acquisition, the Company recorded a reduction to the carrying value of satellites under construction (including capitalized interest) for fiscal year 2024 of approximately $
1.67
 billion (based on the Company's originally estimated ViaSat-3 F1 satellite output capabilities compared to the anticipated potential and configured capacity of the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite, the full value of the I-6 F2 satellite and the ViaSat-4 satellite program, each a separate asset group), which was partially offset by total insurance claim receivables of approximately $
770.0
 million. As a result, the Company recorded a net loss of approximately $
905.5
 million during fiscal year 2024, including liabilities associated with the termination of certain subcontractor agreements, in selling, general and administrative expenses in its communication services segment in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). During fiscal years 
2025 and 2024
, the Company received approximately $
251.5
 million and $
508.6
 million, respectively, in insurance recovery proceeds related to such claims. Subsequent to fiscal year 
2025
, approximately $
10.0
 million in additional insurance recovery proceeds were received, marking the full receipt of all insurance recovery proceeds related to such claims.
Occasionally, the Company may enter into finance lease arrangements for various machinery, equipment, computer-related equipment, software, furniture, fixtures, or satellites. The Company records amortization of assets leased under finance lease arrangements (upon lease commencement) within depreciation expense (see Note 1 — The Company and a Summary of Its Significant Accounting Policies — Leases and Note 7 — Leases for more information).

Cloud computing arrangements

The Company enters into certain cloud-based software hosting arrangements that are accounted for as service contracts. Costs incurred for these arrangements are capitalized for application development activities, if material, and immediately expensed for preliminary project activities and postimplementation activities. The Company amortizes the capitalized development costs straight-line over the fixed, non-cancellable term of the associated hosting arrangement plus any reasonably certain renewal periods. The capitalized costs are included in other current assets within the prepaid expenses and other current assets caption, and other assets (long-term) on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
The Company has entered into several cloud computing arrangements that are hosted services contracts mainly as part of projects related to the continuous transformation of technology, integration and implementation of an ERP system. As of March 31, 2025 and 2024
, gross capitalized implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements was $
88.7
 million and $
63.6
 million, respectively. As of 
March 31, 2025 and 2024
, the related accumulated amortization was $
18.4
 million and $
9.5
 million, respectively. The Company recognized amortization of capitalized implementation costs of $
8.8
 million, $
4.2
 million, and an insignificant amount during fiscal years 
2025, 2024 and 2023
, respectively.
Leases
Lessee accounting
In accordance with the authoritative guidance for leases (ASC 842), the Company assesses at contract inception whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Generally, the Company determines that a lease exists when (1) the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) the Company obtains the right to substantially all economic benefits from use of the asset, and (3) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. A lease is classified as a finance lease when one or more of the following criteria are met: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, (2) the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, (3) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset, (4) the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset or (5) the asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any of these criteria.

F-
10

VIASAT, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

At the lease commencement date, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, except short-term leases with an original term of 12 months or less. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, less any lease incentives received. All right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment in accordance with standards that apply to long-lived assets. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using an estimate of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate for a collateralized loan with the same term as the underlying leases.

Lease payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities consist of (1) fixed lease payments for the noncancelable lease term, (2) fixed lease payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal option will be exercised, and (3) variable lease payments that depend on an underlying index or rate, based on the index or rate in effect at lease commencement. Certain of the Company’s real estate lease agreements require variable lease payments that do not depend on an underlying index or rate established at lease commencement. Such payments and changes in payments based on a rate or index are recognized in operating expenses when incurred.

Lease expense for operating leases consists of the fixed lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term plus variable lease payments as incurred. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the depreciation of assets obtained under finance leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense on the lease liability based on the discount rate at lease commencement. For both operating and finance leases, lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense.
Lessor accounting
For broadband equipment leased to customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, the Company has made an accounting policy election not to separate the broadband equipment from the related connectivity services. The connectivity services are the predominant component of these arrangements. The connectivity services are accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. The Company is also a lessor for certain insignificant communications equipment. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.
Business combinations

The authoritative guidance for business combinations (ASC 805) requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method. The purchase price for business combinations is allocated to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets, and assumed liabilities, where applicable. The Company recognizes technology, contracts and customer relationships, orbital slots and spectrum assets, trade names and other as identifiable intangible assets, which are recorded at fair value as of the transaction date. Goodwill is recorded when consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities. Measurement-period adjustments to assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding offset to goodwill are recorded in the period they occur, which may include up to one year from the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill and intangible assets

The authoritative guidance for business combinations (ASC 805) specifies criteria for recognizing and reporting intangible assets apart from goodwill; however, acquired workforce must be recognized and reported in goodwill. The authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets (ASC 350) requires that intangible assets with an indefinite life should not be amortized until their life is determined to be finite. All other intangible assets must be amortized over their useful life. The authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, but instead requires these assets to be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of specified events. In addition, all goodwill must be assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing.

F-

VIASAT, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Patents, orbital slots and other licenses

The Company capitalizes the costs of obtaining or acquiring patents, orbital slots and other licenses. Amortization of intangible assets that have finite lives is provided for by the straight-line method over the shorter of the legal or estimated economic life. Total capitalized costs related to patents, orbital slots and other licenses of $
129.4
 million and $
120.9
 million were included in other assets as of 
March 31, 2025 and 2024
, respectively. Accumulated amortization related to these assets was $
10.2
 million and $
8.4
 million as of 
March 31, 2025 and 2024
, respectively. Amortization expense related to these assets was $
1.9
 million for fiscal year 2025, and an insignificant amount for each of fiscal years 2024 and 2023. If a patent, orbital slot or other license is rejected, abandoned or otherwise invalidated, the unamortized cost is expensed in that period. During fiscal years 
2025, 2024 and 2023
, the Company did not write off any significant costs due to abandonment or impairment.

Debt issuance costs

Debt issuance costs are amortized and recognized as interest expense using the effective interest rate method, or, when the results are not materially different, on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the related debt. The Company capitalized $
35.6
 million, $
53.9
 million and 
zero
 debt issuance costs during fiscal years 
2025, 2024 and 2023
, respectively. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to extinguished debt are expensed at the time the debt is extinguished and recorded in loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). If the terms of a financing obligation are amended and accounted for as a debt modification by the Company, fees incurred directly with the lending institution are capitalized and amortized over the remaining contractual term using the effective interest method. Fees incurred with other parties are expensed as incurred. Debt issuance costs related to the Company's revolving credit facilities (collectively, the Revolving Credit Facilities) are recorded in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with the authoritative guidance for imputation of interest (ASC 835-30). Debt issuance costs related to the Company’s senior secured and senior unsecured notes (collectively, the Notes) and senior secured term loan credit facilities (together with the Revolving Credit Facilities, the Credit Facilities) are recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt, consistent with debt discounts, in accordance with ASC 835-30.

Software development

Costs of developing software for sale are charged to independent research and development (IR&D) expense when incurred, until technological feasibility has been established. Software development costs incurred from the time technological feasibility is reached until the product is available for general release to customers are capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Once the product is available for general release, the software development costs are amortized based on the ratio of current to future revenue for each product with an annual minimum equal to straight-line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, generally within 
five years
. As of 
March 31, 2025 and 2024
, the Company had $
780.3
 million and $
723.9
 million, respectively, of capitalized costs related to software developed for resale. Accumulated amortization related to these assets was $
515.8
 million and $
483.3
 million as of 
March 31, 2025 and 2024
, respectively. The Company capitalized $
78.4
 million and $
77.5
 million of costs related to software developed for resale during the fiscal years ended 
March 31, 2025 and 2024
, respectively. Amortization expense for capitalized software development costs was $
54.5
 million, $
59.1
 million and $
54.4
 million during fiscal years 
2025, 2024 and 2023
, respectively. Amortization expense related to these assets is expected to be in the range of approximately $
60
 million to $
30
 million over each of the next five fiscal years (with the higher end of the range in the earlier fiscal years), estimated based on annual minimum straight-line amortization.

Impairment of long-lived and other long-term assets (property, equipment and satellites, and other assets, including goodwill)

In accordance with the authoritative guidance for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets (ASC 360), the Company assesses potential impairments to long-lived assets, including property, equipment and satellites, and other assets, when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset (or group of assets) are less than the asset’s carrying value. Any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations. Except for the impairment related to the Company's exit from certain locations in EMEA markets, disposal of certain related assets and termination of certain related long-term contracts in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the impairment related to certain of the Company's satellites under construction and satellite programs (as discussed in Note 1 — The Company and a Summary of Its Significant Accounting Policies — Property, equipment and satellites above) in the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2024 and the impairment of certain right-of-use assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, 
no
 other material impairments were recorded by the Company for fiscal years 
2025, 2024 and 2023. See Note 7 — Leases for additional information.

The Company accounts for its goodwill under ASC 350. Current authoritative guidance allows the Company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying value, the Company concludes that no impairment exists. Alternatively, if the Company determines in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value, then the Company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test to identify both the existence of an impairment and the amount of impairment loss, by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, then a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company tests goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist.

In accordance with ASC 350, the Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill is impaired. The qualitative analysis includes assessing the impact of changes in certain factors including: (1) changes in forecasted operating results and comparing actual results to projections, (2) changes in the industry or its competitive environment since the acquisition date, (3) changes in the overall economy, its market share and market interest rates since the acquisition date, (4) trends in the stock price and related market capitalization and enterprise values, (5) trends in peer companies' total enterprise value metrics, and (6) additional factors such as management turnover, changes in regulation and changes in litigation matters.
Furthermore, in addition to qualitative analysis, the Company believes it is appropriate to conduct a quantitative analysis periodically as a prudent review of its reporting unit goodwill fair values. The Company's quantitative analysis estimates the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows and other indicators of fair value. The forecast of future cash flow is based on the Company's best estimate of each reporting unit’s future revenue and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor resources, general market conditions, successful launch of its satellites currently under construction and other relevant factors. Based on a quantitative analysis for fiscal year 2025, the Company concluded that estimated fair values of its reporting units exceed their respective carrying values.
Based on the Company’s qualitative and quantitative assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their related carrying value as of March 31, 2025
. 
No
 impairments were recorded by the Company related to goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal years 
2025, 2024 and 2023
.

Fair value of financial instruments

The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities. The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term borrowings, other long-term interest bearing liabilities and interest rate cap contracts is determined by using available market information for those securities or similar financial instruments (see Note 3 — Fair Value Measurements).

Self-insurance and post-retirement medical benefit liabilities

The Company has self-insurance plans to retain a portion of the exposure for losses related to employee medical benefits and workers’ compensation. The self-insurance plans include policies which provide for both specific and aggregate stop-loss limits. The Company utilizes actuarial methods as well as other historical information for the purpose of estimating ultimate costs for a particular plan year. Based on these actuarial methods, along with currently available information and insurance industry statistics, the Company has recorded self-insurance liability for its plans of $
5.9
 million and $
6.5
 million as of 
March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company’s estimate, which is subject to inherent variability, is based on average claims experience in the Company’s industry and its own experience in terms of frequency and severity of claims, including asserted and unasserted claims incurred but not reported, with no explicit provision for adverse fluctuation from year to year. This variability may lead to ultimate payments being either greater or less than the amounts presented above. Self-insurance liabilities have been classified as a current liability in accrued and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with the estimated timing of the projected payments.
As a part of the Inmarsat Acquisition, the Company assumed a post-retirement medical benefit plan for retired employees (and their dependents) who were employed by Inmarsat before January 1, 1998.
 The plan is funded by the Company and there are no plan assets from which the costs are paid. The cost of providing these benefits is actuarially determined and accrued over the service period of the active employee groups. The annual increase in Inmarsat's contribution to post-retirement medical liability is capped at the United Kingdom Consumer Price Index +1%.

Indemnification provisions

In the ordinary course of business, the Company includes indemnification provisions in certain of its contracts, generally relating to parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company will indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, including but not limited to losses relating to third-party intellectual property claims. To date, there have not been any material costs incurred in connection with such indemnification clauses. The Company’s insurance policies do not necessarily cover the cost of defending indemnification claims or providing indemnification, so if a claim was filed against the Company by any party that the Company has agreed to indemnify, the Company could incur substantial legal costs and damages. A claim would be accrued when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. At March 31, 2025 and 2024
, 
no
 such amounts were accrued related to the aforementioned provisions.

Noncontrolling interests

A noncontrolling interest represents the equity interest in a subsidiary that is not attributable, either directly or indirectly, to the Company and is reported as equity of the Company, separate from the Company’s controlling interest. Revenues, expenses, gains, losses, net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) are reported in the consolidated financial statements at the consolidated amounts, which include the amounts attributable to both the controlling and noncontrolling interest.
On August 15, 2022, TrellisWare, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the repurchase of shares of its common stock from participating stockholders for a total purchase price of approximately $
30.0
 million. The Company did not elect to participate in the share repurchase, and accordingly, the Company's ownership percentage of TrellisWare increased to slightly over 
60
% as a result of the share repurchase.
The following table summarizes the effect of the change in the Company's percentage ownership interest in TrellisWare on the Company's equity for the fiscal years ended

Common stock held in treasury

As of March 31, 2025 and 2024
, the Company had 
zero
 shares of common stock held in treasury.

During fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023
, the Company issued 
1,575,356
, 
1,547,027
 and 
1,376,583
 shares of common stock, respectively, based on the vesting terms of certain restricted stock unit (RSU) agreements. In order for employees to satisfy minimum statutory employee tax withholding requirements related to the issuance of common stock underlying these RSU agreements, the Company repurchased 
553,495
, 
531,091
 and 
487,111
 shares of common stock at cost and with a total value of $
5.5
 million, $
11.7
 million and $
16.5
 million during fiscal years 
2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Although shares withheld for employee withholding taxes are technically not issued, they are treated as common stock repurchases for accounting purposes (with such shares deemed to be repurchased and then immediately retired), as they reduce the number of shares that otherwise would have been issued upon vesting of the RSUs. These retired shares remain as authorized stock and are considered to be unissued. The retirement of treasury stock had no impact on the Company’s total consolidated stockholders’ equity.

Derivatives
As a result of the Inmarsat Acquisition (see Note 4 — Acquisition for more information), the Company assumed interest rate cap contracts to hedge the variable interest rate under Inmarsat's senior secured term loan facilities. 
The interest rate cap contracts provided protection from Compound SOFR rates over 
2
%, covered the total nominal amount of Inmarsat's senior secured term loan facilities of $
1.6
 billion, and matured in February 2025. At the time of the acquisition, the Company continued to account for the interest rate cap contracts as cash-flow hedges. Upon amendment of Inmarsat's senior secured term loan facilities on March 28, 2024 (see Note 8 — Senior Notes and Other Long-Term Debt for more information), the portion of the interest rate cap contracts related to Inmarsat's $1.3 billion senior secured term loan facility (the 2024 Inmarsat Term Loan Facility) continued to be accounted for as cash-flow hedges, as the interest rate cap contracts remained in place with their original maturity date.
The Company did not use this instrument, or these types of instruments in general, for speculative or trading purposes. The Company’s objective was to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flows associated with changes in debt with variable interest rates. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value. The value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the cash flows are due to be received in greater than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability if the cash flows are due to be received in less than 12 months.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments which are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments until the underlying transaction affects the Company’s earnings, at which time they are then recorded in the same income statement line as the underlying transaction. The Company may designate a derivative with periodic cash settlements and a non-zero fair value at hedge inception as the hedging instrument in a qualifying cash flow hedging relationship. The non-zero fair value of cash flow hedges on the designation date is recognized into income under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument and in the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations as the earnings of the hedge item, with the offset recorded to other comprehensive income (loss).
During fiscal years 2025 and 2024
, the Company recognized a gain of $
1.2
 million (and related tax expense of an insignificant amount) and a gain of $
20.2
 million (and related tax expense of $
5.1
 million), respectively, in other comprehensive income arising from changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap contracts (designated as cash-flow hedging instruments) related to Inmarsat's senior secured term loan facilities. During fiscal years 
2025 and 2024
, the Company recorded a decrease of $
15.9
 million (and related tax benefit of $
4.0
 million) and a decrease of $
5.5
 million (and related tax benefit of $
1.4
 million), respectively, to other comprehensive income and interest expense, net of the recognition into income of the non-zero hedge inception fair value (based on the nature of the underlying transaction). During fiscal years 
2025 and 2024
, the Company received $
46.3
 million and $
45.6
 million in cash, respectively, as a result of periodic cash settlements, which are included in operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As of March 31, 2024, the fair value of the Company's interest rate cap contracts recorded in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets was $
44.5
 million.

Foreign currency

In general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is deemed to be the local country’s currency. Consequently, assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States are generally translated into U.S. dollars, and the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Viasat, Inc. stockholders’ equity.

Other comprehensive income or loss related to the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments attributable to Viasat, Inc. during fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023
 was a loss of $
9.3
 million (net of an insignificant amount of tax), a gain of $
3.0
 million (net of an insignificant amount of tax), and a loss of $
13.1
 million (net of an insignificant amount of tax), respectively.
Revenue recognition

In accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606), the Company applies the five-step model to its contracts with its customers. Under this model the Company (1) identifies the contract with the customer, (2) identifies its performance obligations in the contract, (3) determines the transaction price for the contract, (4) allocates the transaction price to its performance obligations and (5) recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies its performance obligations. These performance obligations generally include the purchase of services (including broadband capacity and the leasing of broadband equipment), the purchase of products, and the development and delivery of complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts. Taxes imposed by governmental authorities on the Company’s revenues, such as sales taxes and value added taxes, are excluded from net sales.
Furthermore, from time to time, the Company participates in U.S. federal and state programs under which the government funds part of the costs of providing services in targeted locations such as unserved or under-served high cost or rural areas, or for certain types of customers. The Company accounts for funds received from the government by analogy to International Accounting Standards (IAS) 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, and recognizes funds received in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) when there is reasonable assurance that it will comply with the conditions associated with the grant and the grant will be received. Recognition occurs on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognizes as expenses the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, the amounts recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements related to these types of arrangements were not material.
Performance obligations
The timing of satisfaction of performance obligations may require judgment. The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from contracts with customers for services, primarily consisting of connectivity services. These contracts typically require advance or recurring monthly payments by the customer. The Company’s obligation to provide connectivity services is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. The measure of progress over time is based upon either a period of time (e.g., over the estimated contractual term) or usage (e.g., bandwidth used/bytes of data processed). The Company evaluates whether broadband equipment provided to its customers as part of the delivery of connectivity services represents a lease in accordance with ASC 842. As discussed above under “Leases - Lessor accounting”, for broadband equipment leased to customers in conjunction with the delivery of connectivity services, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components of connectivity service arrangements as a single performance obligation as the connectivity services represent the predominant component.

F-
16

VIASAT, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

The Company also derives a portion of its revenues from contracts with customers to provide products. Performance obligations to provide products are satisfied at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer. These contracts typically require payment by the customer upon passage of control and determining the point at which control is transferred may require judgment. To identify the point at which control is transferred to the customer, the Company considers indicators that include, but are not limited to, whether (1) the Company has the present right to payment for the asset, (2) the customer has legal title to the asset, (3) physical possession of the asset has been transferred to the customer, (4) the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and (5) the customer has accepted the asset. For product revenues, control generally passes to the customer upon delivery of goods to the customer.
The Company’s contracts with the U.S. Government typically are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. Government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. Government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of the Company’s U.S. Government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the Company either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments based on a percentage of the costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer can often retain a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, the Company’s U.S. Government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which the Company presents as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from the Company’s customers are classified as receivables on the balance sheet. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. For the Company’s U.S. Government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays the Company for its actual costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. Government contracts, the Company typically receives interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, the Company may be entitled to receive an advance payment. The Company recognizes a liability for these advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and presents it as collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues on the balance sheet. An advance payment is not typically considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect the Company from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.
Performance obligations related to developing and delivering complex equipment built to customer specifications under long-term contracts are recognized over time as these performance obligations do not create assets with an alternative use to the Company and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance to date. To measure the transfer of control, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. The Company generally uses the cost-to-cost measure of progress for its contracts because that best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as the Company incurs costs on its contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Estimating the total costs at completion of a performance obligation requires management to make estimates related to items such as subcontractor performance, material costs and availability, labor costs and productivity and the costs of overhead. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized in the period the loss is determined.

Contract costs on U.S. Government contracts are subject to audit and review by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), and other U.S. Government agencies, as well as negotiations with U.S. Government representatives. As of March 31, 2025
, the DCMA had approved the Company’s incurred costs through fiscal year 2022. The DCAA is currently auditing the Company's fiscal year 2024 recurring incurred cost submissions. The Company's cost accounting practices are examined for compliance with the applicable Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). Although the Company has recorded contract revenues subsequent to fiscal year 2022 based upon an estimate of costs that the Company believes will be approved upon final audit or review, the Company does not know the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments and if future adjustments exceed the Company’s estimates, its profitability would be adversely affected. The Company had $
14.8
 million and $
16.6
 million as of 
March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively, in contract-related reserves for its estimate of potential refunds to customers for potential cost adjustments on several multi-year U.S. Government cost reimbursable contracts (see Note 15 — Contingencies for more information).

Evaluation of transaction price
The evaluation of transaction price, including the amounts allocated to performance obligations, may require significant judgments. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue, and, where applicable, the cost at completion, is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. The Company’s contracts may contain award fees, incentive fees, or other provisions, including the potential for significant financing components, that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These amounts, which are sometimes variable, can be dictated by performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets, the timing of payments, and customer discretion. The Company estimates variable consideration at the amount to which it expects to be entitled. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company’s estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company’s anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company. In the event an agreement includes embedded financing components, the Company recognizes interest expense or interest income on the embedded financing components using the effective interest method. This methodology uses an implied interest rate which reflects the incremental borrowing rate which would be expected to be obtained in a separate financing transaction. The Company has elected the practical expedient not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.
If a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. Estimating standalone selling prices may require judgment. When available, the Company utilizes the observable price of a good or service when the Company sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by considering all information (including market conditions, specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably available.
Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations
The Company’s remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of firm contracts and orders for which work has not been performed. The Company includes in its remaining performance obligations only those contracts and orders for which it has accepted purchase orders. Remaining performance obligations associated with the Company’s subscribers for fixed consumer and business broadband services in its communication services segment exclude month-to-month service contracts in accordance with a practical expedient and are estimated using a portfolio approach in which the Company reviews all relevant promotional activities and calculates the remaining performance obligation using the average service component for the portfolio and the average time remaining under the contract. The Company’s future recurring IFC service contracts in its communication services segment do not have minimum service purchase requirements and therefore are not included in the Company’s remaining performance obligations. As of March 31, 2025, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was 
$
3.6
 billion, of which the 
Company expects to recognize 
approximately half
 over the next 12 months, with the balance recognized thereafter
.
Disaggregation of revenue
The Company operates and manages its business in 
two
 reportable segments: communication services and defense and advanced technologies. Revenue is disaggregated by products and services, customer type, contract type, business line and geographic area, as the Company believes this approach best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. See Note 16 — Segment Information for disaggregation of revenue by business line and additional disaggregated revenue disclosures.

 of total revenues for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenues from the U.S. Government were attributable to each of the communication services segment and defense and advanced technologies segment, with approximately half of such revenues reported within each of these two segments for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, while the majority of revenues from the U.S. Government was attributable to the defense and advanced technologies segment for fiscal year 2023.
The Company’s revenues are primarily derived from two types of contracts: fixed-price and cost-reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts (which require the Company to provide products and services under a contract at a specified price) comprised approximately 
96
%
, 
95
%
 and 
93
%
 of the Company's total revenues for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a majority of which were reported in the Company's communication services segment. The remainder of the Company’s revenues for such periods was derived primarily from cost-reimbursement contracts (under which the Company is reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract, plus a fee or profit), which contracts are mainly reported within the Company's defense and advanced technologies segment.
Historically, a portion of the Company’s revenues has been derived from customer contracts that include the development of products. The development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer’s specific requirements and, accordingly, expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding (which includes a profit component) is included in revenues. Revenues for the Company’s funded development from its customer contracts were approximately 
11
%, 
12
% and 
16
% of its total revenues for fiscal years 
2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, mainly reported within the Company's defense and advanced technologies segment.

Contract balances
Contract balances consist of contract assets and contract liabilities. A contract asset, or with respect to the Company, an unbilled accounts receivable, is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of the Company’s right to bill and receive consideration, typically resulting from sales under long-term contracts. Unbilled accounts receivable are generally expected to be billed and collected within one year. The unbilled accounts receivable will decrease as provided services or delivered products are billed. The Company receives payments from customers based on a billing schedule established in the Company’s contracts.

When consideration is received in advance of the delivery of goods or services, a contract liability, or with respect to the Company, collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues, is recorded. Reductions in the collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues will be recorded as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.
The following table presents contract assets and liabilities as of

Other assets and deferred costs – contracts with customers
Per ASC 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs – Contracts with Customers, the Company recognizes an asset from the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the Company expects to recover those costs. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that the Company incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. ASC 340-40 also requires the recognition of an asset from the costs incurred to fulfill a contract when (1) the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that the Company can specifically identify, (2) the costs generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future, and (3) the costs are expected to be recovered. In accordance with the guidance, the Company recognizes an asset related to commission costs incurred, primarily in the Company’s communication services segment, and recognizes an asset related to costs incurred to fulfill contracts. Costs to acquire customer contracts are amortized over the estimated customer contract life. Costs to fulfill customer contracts are amortized in proportion to the revenue to which the costs relate. For contracts with an estimated amortization period of less than one year, the Company elected the practical expedient and expenses incremental costs immediately. The Company’s deferred customer contract acquisition costs and costs to fulfill contract balances were $
13.0
 million and $
56.4
 million, respectively, as of 
March 31, 2025
. Of the Company’s total deferred customer contract acquisition costs and costs to fulfill contracts, $
15.2
 million was included in other current assets within the prepaid expenses and other current assets caption on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and $
54.2
 million was included in other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of 
March 31, 2025
. The Company’s deferred customer contract acquisition costs and costs to fulfill contract balances were $
23.1
 million and $
55.1
 million, respectively, as of 
March 31, 2024
. Of the Company’s total deferred customer contract acquisition costs and costs to fulfill contracts, $
20.2
 million was included in other current assets within the prepaid expenses and other current assets caption on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and $
58.0
 million was included in other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of 
March 31, 2024
. For total deferred customer contract acquisition costs and contract fulfillment costs, the Company’s amortization and reduction of carrying value associated with contract termination was $
33.1
 million, $

Advertising costs

In accordance with the authoritative guidance for advertising costs (ASC 720-35), advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023
 were $
19.2
 million, $
26.4
 million and $
22.8
 million, respectively.
Stock-based compensation

In accordance with the authoritative guidance for share-based payments (ASC 718), the Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award. Expense for RSUs and stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee’s requisite service period. Expense for performance-based RSUs (PSUs) with a market condition (such as a stock price milestone) (market condition PSUs) that vest is recognized regardless of the actual outcome achieved and is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. Expense for PSUs with a performance condition (such as an operational milestone) (performance condition PSUs) that vest is recorded each period based on a probability assessment of the expected outcome of the performance metric with a final adjustment upon measurement at the end of the performance period and is recognized regardless of the actual outcome achieved and is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The Company recognizes excess tax benefits or deficiencies on vesting or settlement of awards as discrete items within income tax benefit or provision within net income (loss) and the related cash flows are classified within operating activities. See Note 9 — Common Stock and Stock Plans to the Company's consolidated financial statements for more information.
Independent research and development

IR&D, which is not directly funded by a third party, is expensed as incurred. IR&D expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, supplies, prototype materials and other expenses related to research and development (R&D) programs.

Income taxes

Accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes (ASC 740). The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.

A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future tax consequences resulting from differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax credit and loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The Company’s analysis of the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets considered historical as well as forecasted future operating results, the reversal of temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted), and the availability of tax planning strategies.
Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potential common stock, if dilutive during the period, which are included in the earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method. Potential common stock includes options granted (including market-based performance stock options), RSUs (other than PSUs), market condition PSUs and performance condition PSUs awarded under the Company’s equity compensation plan, common shares expected to be issued under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan, and shares potentially issuable under the Viasat 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan in connection with the Company’s decision to pay a discretionary match in common stock or cash.

Segment reporting

The Company reports its results in two separate segments consisting of communication services and defense and advanced technologies. The Company's segments are determined consistent with the way management currently organizes and evaluates financial information internally for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company’s reportable segments (communication services and defense and advanced technologies) have been determined based upon their market and economic characteristics while also giving consideration to the structure and management of various business lines. The reportable segments are primarily determined based upon industry categories and core competencies relating to product or service end market distribution, operations, and servicing and distinguished by the type of customer and, to a lesser extent, the related contractual requirements.
The Company’s communication services segment provides a wide range of broadband and narrowband communications solutions across government and commercial mobility markets, as well as for residential and enterprise fixed broadband customers. The Company’s defense and advanced technologies segment develops and offers a diverse array of resilient, vertically integrated solutions to government and commercial customers, leveraging the Company’s technical competencies in encryption, cyber security, tactical gateways, modems and waveforms. The more regulated government environment for defense, encryption and other products is subject to unique contractual requirements and possesses economic characteristics that differ from the communication services segment.
Recent authoritative guidance
In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (
Topic
 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. ASU 2022-03 clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered in measuring the security's fair value. The standard also requires certain disclosures for equity securities that are subject to contractual restrictions. The Company adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and the guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, Leases (Topic 842) – Common Control Agreements. The amendments in this update that apply to public business entities clarify the accounting for leasehold improvements associated with common control leases. The Company adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and the guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. This ASU amends certain disclosure and presentation requirements for a variety of topics within the FASB ASC. These amendments will also align the requirements in the ASC with the SEC's regulations. The effective date for each amended topic in the ASC is the date on which the SEC’s removal of the related disclosure requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, and will not be effective if the SEC has not removed the applicable disclosure requirements by June 30, 2027. Early adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU requires public entities to enhance disclosures about their reportable segments' significant expenses on an interim and annual basis. Beginning with the annual reporting of fiscal year 2025, the Company adopted the new guidance on a retrospective basis. See Note 16 — Segment Information for additional information.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 enhances income tax disclosures by requiring disclosure of specific categories in the income tax rate reconciliation table and disaggregation of income taxes paid. The new standard will become effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2026. Early adoption is permitted and the new standard should be applied prospectively, however retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02, Codification Improvements – Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements. This update contains amendments to the Codification that remove references to various Concepts Statements. The amendments in this update are not intended to result in significant accounting changes for most entities. The amendments in this update are effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2026. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

This ASU requires additional disclosures about certain categories of costs and expenses in the notes to financial statements. As clarified in ASU 2025-01, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date, the new standard will become effective for the Company’s annual disclosures beginning in fiscal year 2028 and for interim disclosures beginning in fiscal year 2029. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments should be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of the ASU or retrospectively to any or all periods presented in the financial statements.

Note 3 — Fair Value Measurements

In accordance with the authoritative guidance for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (ASC 820), the Company determines fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, and prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value from market-based assumptions to entity specific assumptions:

•
Level 1 — Inputs based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date. 
•
Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
•
Level 3 — Inputs which reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument’s valuation. 
The following tables present the Company's hierarchy for its assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of 
March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024
. The Company had 
no
 liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of both

Cash equivalents
 — The Company’s cash equivalents consist of money market funds, with a significant portion held in U.S. government-backed securities and treasuries.
Interest rate cap contracts 
— The Company assumed interest rate cap contracts to hedge the variable interest rate under Inmarsat's senior secured term loan facilities (see Note 1 — The Company and a Summary of Its Significant Accounting Policies — Derivatives for more information). The Company’s interest rate cap contracts were valued using the forward interest rate curve at each reporting date (Level 2).

Long-term debt
 — As of March 31, 2025, the Company’s long-term debt (including current portion) was comprised of (1) $442.6 million in aggregate principal amount of Viasat's 5.625% Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes) (which were redeemed in full subsequent to fiscal year end), $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Viasat's 5.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes), $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Viasat's 6.500% Senior Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes), $1.975 billion in aggregate principal amount of Inmarsat's 9.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the Inmarsat 2029 Notes), and $733.4 million in aggregate principal amount of Viasat’s 7.500% Senior Notes due 2031 (the 2031 Notes), (2) borrowings under Viasat’s $700.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the 2022 Term Loan Facility), borrowings under Viasat’s $616.7 million senior secured term loan facility (the 2023 Term Loan Facility), borrowings under the 2024 Inmarsat Term Loan Facility, borrowings under Inmarsat’s original senior secured term loan facility (the Original Inmarsat Term Loan Facility and, together with the 2024 Inmarsat Term Loan Facility, the Inmarsat Term Loan Facilities) and borrowings under Viasat’s direct loan facility with the Export-Import Bank of the United States (the Ex-Im Credit Facility), and (3) finance lease obligations reported at the present value of future minimum lease payments with current accrued interest. Long-term debt related to the Revolving Credit Facilities is reported at the outstanding principal amount of borrowings, while long-term debt related to the Company's other Credit Facilities and the Notes is reported at amortized cost. However, for disclosure purposes, the Company is required to measure the fair value of outstanding debt on a recurring basis. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt related to the Company's variable rate Credit Facilities approximates its carrying amount due to its variable interest rate, which approximates a market interest rate. As of March 31, 2025 and 2024
, the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt related to the Ex-Im Credit Facility was Level 2 and was approximately $
19.2
 million and $
38.5
 million, respectively. As of 
March 31, 2025 and 2024
, the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding long-term debt related to each series of Notes was Level 2 and was $
438.6
 million and $
680.8
 million, respectively, for the 2025 Notes, $
575.0
 million and $
564.0
 million, respectively, for the 2027 Notes, $
350.0
 million and $
307.5
 million, respectively, for the 2028 Notes, and $
552.8
 million and $
529.9
 million, respectively, for the 2031 Notes. As of 
March 31, 2025
, the estimated fair value of Inmarsat 2029 Notes was Level 2 and was $
1.82
 billion. As of 
March 31, 2024
, the estimated fair value of Inmarsat's 
6.750
% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the Inmarsat 2026 Notes) was Level 2 and was $
2.04
 billion. The Inmarsat 2026 Notes were repurchased and redeemed in full during fiscal year 2025.
Satellite performance incentive obligations
 — The Company’s contracts with satellite manufacturers require the Company to make monthly in-orbit satellite performance incentive payments with respect to certain satellites in commercial service, including interest, through fiscal year 
2028
, subject to the continued satisfactory performance of the applicable satellites. The Company records the net present value of these expected future payments as a liability and as a component of the cost of the satellites. However, for disclosure purposes, the Company is required to measure the fair value of outstanding satellite performance incentive obligations on a recurring basis. The fair value of the Company’s outstanding satellite performance incentive obligations is estimated to approximate their carrying value based on current rates (Level 2). As of 
March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company’s estimated satellite performance incentive obligations relating to certain satellites in commercial service, including accrued interest, were 
$
11.4
 million and $
15.9
 million, respectively.

Contingencies
 — In connection with the acquisition of the remaining 
51
% interest in Euro Broadband Infrastructure Sàrl (EBI) on April 30, 2021, part of the purchase price consideration was determined approximately two years after the closing date, and as a result 
the Company received €
20.0
 million, or approximately $
22.0
 million, in cash and recorded a gain of approximately $
18.1
 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
 The consideration paid was contingent based on certain outcomes as defined in the acquisition agreement. Each reporting period, the Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration based on unobservable inputs and probability weightings using standard valuation techniques (Level 3). For both fiscal years 
2024 and 2023
, the change in fair value of the contingent consideration was immaterial.

Note 4 — Acquisition
In May 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Inmarsat Holdings, a privately held leading provider of global mobile satellite communications services. The Inmarsat Acquisition positions the Company as a leading global communications innovator with enhanced scale and scope to connect the world affordably, securely and reliably. The complementary assets and resources of the combined company position the Company to provide advanced new services in mobile and fixed segments, driving greater customer choice in broadband communications and narrowband services (including the Internet of Things (IoT)). These benefits and additional opportunities were among the factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill of $
1.5
 billion which was recognized in the Company's communication services segment. The goodwill recognized was not deductible for U.S. and foreign income tax purposes.
The consideration transferred of approximately $
2.7
 billion was comprised of $
2.1
 billion of the fair value of approximately 
46.36
 million shares of the Company’s common stock issued at the closing of the transaction and $
550.7
 million in cash consideration. In connection with the Inmarsat Acquisition, the Company recorded acquisition-related transaction costs of 
zero
, $
31.3
 million and $
40.4
 million during fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The purchase price allocation of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in the Inmarsat Acquisition based on the estimated fair values as of May 30, 2023, adjusted since the closing of the Inmarsat Acquisition, primarily between property, equipment and satellites, identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax liabilities and goodwill, is as follows:

Management determined the fair value of acquired customer relationships by applying the multi-period excess earnings method, which involved the use of significant judgments and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, discount rates, and contributory asset charges. Additionally, management determined the fair value of acquired orbital slots and spectrum assets using an avoided cost method, which involved the use of significant judgments and assumptions related to hypothetical lease payments, discount rates, and contributory asset charges.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

The intangible assets acquired in the Inmarsat Acquisition were determined in accordance with ASC 805, based on estimated fair values using valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach to measure fair value.
The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of Inmarsat from the date of acquisition. The Company recorded approximately $
1.4
 billion in revenue and $
214.6
 million of net loss during fiscal year 2024 from the Inmarsat business following the acquisition date, which were recorded in the Company's communication services segment in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
In November 2023, as a part of an important milestone in the Company’s integration program following the Inmarsat Acquisition and as part of the Company’s ongoing strategy to streamline operations and better serve the Company’s growing customer base, the Company completed work on the rationalization of roles in the Company’s global business, which was intended to achieve both operational and cost efficiencies. As part of the role rationalization, the Company reduced its global workforce and recorded total costs (primarily related to employee severance payments, benefits and related termination costs) of approximately $
48
 million during fiscal year 2024. These one-time costs were recorded within operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in both of the Company’s segments.
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
The unaudited financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for the Company and Inmarsat on a pro forma basis, as though the companies had been combined as of the beginning of fiscal year 2023, April 1, 2022. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and may not be indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the related fiscal period. 
The pro forma financial information for fiscal year 2024 includes the business combination accounting effects primarily related to the amortization and depreciation changes from acquired intangible and tangible assets, interest expense from the debt issued to finance the acquisition, acquisition-related transaction costs and related tax effects.

Note 5 — Discontinued Operations
On October 1, 2022, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to sell the Link-16 TDL Business in its defense and advanced technologies segment to L3Harris in exchange for approximately $
1.96
 billion in cash, subject to adjustments. In accordance with ASC 205-20, the Company determined that the Link-16 TDL Business met held-for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. On January 3, 2023, the Company completed the Link-16 TDL Sale. Accordingly, the Company
 classified the results of the Link-16 TDL Business as discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023.
Upon completion of
 the Link-16 TDL Sale, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $
1.66
 billion (net of costs to sell of $
40.8
 million) in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 within net income (loss) from
 discontinued operations, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for fiscal year 2023. The Link-16 TDL Sale substantially reduced both debt and net leverage, and allowed closer alignment in investment synergies across the Company's business.

In connection with the closing of the Link-16 TDL Sale on January 3, 2023, the Company and L3Harris entered into certain ancillary commercial agreements, including certain license agreements for the cross-licensing by each party of certain intellectual property rights relating to the Link-16 TDL Business and the Company’s retained businesses, a supply agreement with respect to the supply of certain Link-16 and related products following the closing, and certain services agreements for the provision of engineering and support services for the transition of the Link-16 TDL Business following the closing, in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. The impact of these agreements on the Company's consolidated financial statements was not significant.

Note 7 — Leases
The Company’s operating leases consist primarily of leases for office space, data centers and satellite ground facilities and have remaining terms that typically range from less than 
one year
 to 
17 years
, 
some of which include renewal options, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within one year.
 Certain earth station leases have renewal terms that have been deemed to be reasonably certain to be exercised and as such have been recognized as part of the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for such leases in accordance with ASC 842. The Company reports operating lease right-of-use assets in operating lease right-of-use assets and the current and non-current portions of its operating lease liabilities in accrued and other liabilities and non-current operating lease liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company’s finance leases consist primarily of satellite lifetime Ka-band capacity leases and have remaining terms from less than 
one year
 to 
15 years
. The Company reports assets obtained under finance leases in property, equipment and satellites, net and the current and non-current portions of its finance lease liabilities in current portion of long-term debt and other long-term debt, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, after the completion of the Link-16 TDL Sale, the Company reduced its real estate footprint as part of cost-reduction measures taken in order to right-size the Company’s remaining businesses. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment of right-of-use assets of $
19.1
 million and an impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures of an insignificant amount, taking into consideration the current and anticipated future market conditions for sublease income in the markets the leases are located, recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in selling, general and administrative expenses in both of the Company's segments.

Inmarsat Secured Credit Facilities
In March 2024, Inmarsat amended its then-existing senior secured credit facilities to (among other matters): (1) establish the $
1.3
 billion 2024 Inmarsat Term Loan Facility, the proceeds of which, together with cash on hand, were used to repay approximately $
1.38
 billion of the outstanding borrowings under the Original Inmarsat Term Loan Facility, resulting in $
300.0
 million in principal amount of borrowings remaining outstanding under the Original Inmarsat Term Loan Facility at the closing of the amendment, and (2) replace the prior $

 The maturity date for the Original Inmarsat Term Loan Facility is 
December 12, 2026
, and for the 2024 Inmarsat Term Loan Facility is 
September 28, 2029
. The Inmarsat Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of

 and (if more than $
100.0
 million of borrowings are outstanding under the Original Inmarsat Term Loan Facility) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of the Original Inmarsat Term Loan Facility. As of 
March 31, 2025, Inmarsat had 
$
1.3
 billion in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under the 2024 Inmarsat Term Loan Facility and

Borrowings under the 2024 Inmarsat Term Loan Facility are required to be repaid in quarterly installments of $
3.25
 million each, which commenced in the quarter ended 
June 30, 2024
, followed by a final installment of $
1.23
 billion at maturity. As a result of the voluntary prepayments at the closing of the amendment, all quarterly amortization installments with respect to the Original Inmarsat Term Loan Facility have been reduced to 
zero
, with the only remaining scheduled principal repayment being a final installment of $
300.0
 million at the maturity date on 
December 12, 2026
.
Borrowings under the Inmarsat Secured Credit Facilities: (1) in the case of borrowings denominated in U.S. Dollars, bear interest, at Inmarsat's option, at either (i) the highest of (x) for the Original Inmarsat Term Loan Facility, the greater of the federal funds rate or the overnight banking fund rate for such day plus 0.50% and for the 2024 Inmarsat Term Loan Facility, the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (y) the forward-looking one-month term SOFR rate plus 1.00% or (z) the administrative agent's prime rate as announced from time to time, or (ii) the forward-looking term SOFR rate for the applicable interest period (subject to, in the case of the 2024 Inmarsat Term Loan Facility, a floor of 0.50% per annum, in the case of the Inmarsat Revolving Credit Facility, a floor of 0.00% per annum and, in the case of the Original Inmarsat Term Loan Facility, a floor of 1.00% per annum), and (2) in the case of borrowings denominated in available currencies other than U.S. Dollars, bear interest based upon the applicable benchmark for such currencies (as described in the Inmarsat Secured Credit Facilities) plus, in all cases, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for the Original Inmarsat Term Loan Facility is 2.50% per annum for base rate loans and 3.50% per annum for SOFR loans. The applicable margin for the 2024 Inmarsat Term Loan Facility is 3.50% per annum for base rate loans and 4.50% per annum for SOFR loans. The applicable margin for borrowings under the Inmarsat Revolving Credit Facility is based on Inmarsat’s total net leverage ratio and ranges between 1.50% and 2.25% per annum for base rate loans and 2.50% and 3.25% per annum for SOFR loans. As of 
March 31, 2025, the weighted average effective interest rate on the Company's outstanding borrowings under the Inmarsat Term Loan Facilities, was approximately

Stock options, market-based performance stock options and employee stock purchase plan.
 The Company’s stock options typically have a simple 
four-year
 vesting schedule (except for 
one
- and 
three-year
 vesting schedules for options granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors) and a 
six-year
 contractual term.
 The Company grants total shareholder return (TSR) performance stock options to executive officers under the Equity Participation Plan. The number of shares of TSR performance stock options that will become eligible to vest based on the time-based vesting schedule described below is based on a comparison over a four-year performance period of the Company’s TSR to the TSR of the companies included in the S&P Mid Cap 400 Index. The number of options that may become vested and exercisable will range from 0% to 175% of the target number of options based on the Company’s relative TSR ranking for the performance period. The Company’s TSR performance stock options have a 
four-year
 time-based vesting schedule and a 
six-year
 contractual term. The TSR performance stock options must be vested under both the time-based vesting schedule and the performance-based vesting conditions in order to become exercisable. In fiscal year 2024, the Company granted price hurdle performance stock options to executive officers and certain other high-level employees under the Equity Participation Plan. The price hurdle performance stock options must be vested under both a three-year time-based vesting schedule and a market-based vesting condition in order to become exercisable. The number of options that may become vested and exercisable will range from 0% to 250% of the target number of options granted provided that depending on whether the forty-five calendar day trailing average market closing price of the Company's common stock ending on and including such date equals or exceeds certain levels. The Company estimates the fair value of the TSR performance stock options and the price hurdle performance stock options (collectively, the market-based performance stock options) at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation.
 Expense for vested market-based performance stock options with a market condition that vest is recognized regardless of the actual outcome achieved and is recognized on a graded-vesting basis.

There were 
no
 market-based performance stock options granted during fiscal year 2025. The weighted average estimated fair value of market-based performance stock options granted during fiscal years 
2024 and 2023
 was $
16.01
 and $
25.06
 per share, respectively, using the Monte Carlo simulation.
The weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted and shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during fiscal year 2025

The Company’s expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which its stock price is expected to fluctuate over the expected term of the stock-based award. The estimated volatilities for stock options and market-based performance options are based on the historical volatility calculated using the daily stock price of the Company’s stock over a recent historical period equal to the expected term. The risk-free interest rate that the Company uses in determining the fair value of its stock-based awards is based on the implied yield on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term of its stock-based awards. The expected terms or lives of stock options and market-based performance stock options represent the expected period of time from the date of grant to the estimated date that the stock options under the Company’s Equity Participation Plan would be fully exercised. The expected term assumption is estimated based primarily on the options’ vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees’ expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior.

Performance-based restricted stock units
. During fiscal year 2025, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock units with a market condition (such as stock price milestone) (market condition PSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units with a performance condition (such as an operational milestone) (performance condition PSUs) to executive officers and certain other high-level employees under the Equity Participation Plan and Inducement Plan. 
The Company’s market condition PSUs cliff vest at the end of 
three years
 and the Company's 
performance condition PSUs
 have a 
one year
 performance-based vesting period and a 
three-year
 time-based vesting schedule.
 The number of shares of market condition PSUs that will become eligible to vest is based on a comparison over a three-year performance period of the Company’s TSR to the TSR of the companies included in the Russell 3000 Index. The final number of market condition PSUs that will be issued will range from 
0
% to 
175
% of the target number of PSUs based on the Company’s relative TSR ranking for the performance period. The final number of shares of performance condition PSUs that will be issued will range from 
0
% to 
175
% of the target number of PSUs depending on the Company's performance for a given fiscal year period against pre-established targets. PSUs must be vested under both the time-based vesting schedule and the performance-based vesting conditions in order to be issued. PSUs represent a right to receive shares of common stock at a future date determined in accordance with the participant’s award agreement and achievement of performance-based vesting conditions. There is no exercise price and no monetary payment required for receipt of PSUs or the shares issued in settlement of the award. Instead, consideration is furnished in the form of the participant’s services to the Company. The Company estimates the fair value of market condition PSUs at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. The expense for market condition PSUs that vest is recognized regardless of the actual outcome achieved and is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. Compensation cost for performance condition PSUs is based on the fair value on the date of grant. Expense for performance condition PSUs that vest is recognized each period based on a probability assessment of the expected outcome of the performance targets with a final adjustment upon measurement at the end of the performance period and is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. During
 fiscal year 2025, the Company recognized $
5.1
 million in stock-based compensation expense related to all PSUs, for which the expense for performance condition PSUs was based on an estimated weighted average performance multiplier of approximately 
150
%.
The per unit weighted average grant date fair value of PSUs granted during fiscal year 2025 was

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

In accordance with ASC 740, net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on all the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future realization of existing deferred tax assets ultimately depends on future profitability and the existence of sufficient taxable income of appropriate character (for example, ordinary income versus capital gains) within the carryforward period available under tax law. In the event that the Company’s estimate of taxable income is less than that required to utilize the full amount of any deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is established, which would cause a decrease to income in the period such determination is made. A valuation allowance of $
430.5
 million at 
March 31, 2025
 and $
353.6
 million at 
March 31, 2024 has been established relating to federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, federal and state R&D tax credit carryforwards, foreign tax credit carryforwards, and other federal and state net deferred tax assets for cumulative timing differences that, based on management’s estimate of future taxable income attributable to such jurisdictions and generation of additional research credits, are considered more likely than not to expire unused.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company released $
10.3
 million of valuation allowance previously recorded against U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company evaluated both the positive and negative evidence and released valuation allowance equal to the expected benefit from the deferred tax liabilities recorded for legacy Inmarsat U.S. entities in connection with a tax planning strategy to file a consolidated U.S. federal tax return.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, in evaluating the Company’s ability to realize its U.S. net deferred tax assets, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including but not limited to operating results, forecasted ranges of future taxable income, and its recent satellite anomalies. ASC 740 places more weight on the objectively verifiable evidence of current pre-tax losses and recent events than forecasts of future profitability. Therefore, the Company determined it is more likely than not that its U.S. net deferred tax assets will not be realized, excluding its deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the separate U.S. tax return filings of Trellisware and the legacy Inmarsat entities. As a result, the Company’s tax benefit for fiscal year 2024 was reduced by a valuation allowance recorded against such U.S. deferred tax assets.
In evaluating the Company's ability to realize the deferred tax asset for California R&D tax credits, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including operating results and forecasted ranges of future taxable income, and determined it is more likely than not that a majority of its California R&D tax credits will not be realized due to reduced taxable income apportioned to California in connection with the Link-16 TDL Sale. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company determined it is more likely than not that a majority of its California R&D tax credits will not be realized due to reduced taxable income apportioned to California in connection with the Link-16 TDL Sale. As a result, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $
69.0
 million. The Company will continue to monitor its business strategies, weighing positive and negative evidence in assessing its realization of this asset in the future. In the event there is a need to release the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded.
The following table summarizes the activity related to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits:

VIASAT, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

The Company’s policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. As of March 31, 2025 and 2024
, the Company had accrued interest and penalties of approximately $
14.4
 million and $
16.9
 million, respectively. Approximately $
19.2
 million was recorded through goodwill as part of the purchase accounting for the Inmarsat Acquisition at 
March 31, 2024
. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $
2.5
 million, $
2.0
 million and $
1.1
 million for reductions of interest and penalties in income tax expense for fiscal years 
2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company is subject to periodic audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. By statute, the Company’s U.S. federal and state income tax returns are subject to examination by the tax authorities for fiscal years 
2022 and thereafter
. Additionally, net operating loss and R&D tax credit carryovers that were generated in prior years may also be subject to examination. With few exceptions, fiscal years 
2021 and thereafter
 remain open to examination by foreign tax authorities. Calendar years 2007, 2018 and thereafter remain open in the U.K. for certain entities currently under enquiry. Calendar years 2014 and thereafter remain open in Norway for certain entities currently under enquiry. The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken on its tax returns and its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations.
Note 12 — Employee Benefits

The Company is a sponsor of a voluntary deferred compensation plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, the Company may make discretionary contributions to the plan which vest over three years. The Company’s discretionary matching contributions to the plan are based on the amount of employee contributions and can be made in cash or the Company’s common stock at the Company’s election. Subsequent to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, the Company elected to settle the discretionary contributions liability in shares of the Company’s common stock, consistent with fiscal year 2024. Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on March 31, 2025
, the Company would issue approximately 
2,643,897
 shares of common stock at this time. Discretionary contributions accrued by the Company as of 
March 31, 2025 and 2024
 amounted to $
27.5
 million and $
28.1
 million, respectively.

Note 13 — Related-Party Transactions
In the normal course of business, the Company engages in transactions with its equity method investments (Navarino UK and JSAT Mobile), which are considered related-party transactions. The Company recognized revenue from Navarino UK and JSAT Mobile in the amounts of $
65.7
 million and $
64.4
 million during fiscal years 
2025 and 2024
, respectively. The Company received cash of $
68.8
 million and $
61.1
 million from Navarino UK and JSAT Mobile during fiscal years 
2025 and 2024, respectively. Accounts receivable from Navarino UK and JSAT Mobile as of March 31, 2025 and 2024
 was $
8.5
 million and $
13.2
 million, respectively.
Note 14 — Commitments
From time to time, the Company enters into satellite construction agreements as well as various other satellite-related purchase commitments, including with respect to the provision of launch services, operation of its satellites and satellite insurance.

VIASAT, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

The Company’s contracts with satellite manufacturers require the Company to make monthly in-orbit satellite performance incentive payments with respect to certain satellites in commercial service, including interest, through fiscal year 2028, subject to the continued satisfactory performance of the applicable satellites. The Company records the net present value of these expected future payments as a liability and as a component of the cost of the satellites. As of March 31, 2025
, the Company’s estimated satellite performance incentive obligations and accrued interest for the applicable satellites were approximately $
11.4
 million, of which $
6.2
 million and $
5.2
 million have been classified as current in accrued liabilities and non-current in other liabilities, respectively. Under these satellite construction contracts, the Company may incur up to 
$
11.4
 million in total costs for satellite performance incentive obligations and related interest earned with potential future minimum payments of $
5.8
 million, $
4.7
 million and an insignificant amount in fiscal years 
2026, 2027, 2028
, respectively, with 
no
 commitments thereafter.
The Company has various other purchase commitments under satellite capacity agreements which are used to provide satellite networking services to its customers for future minimum payments, which as of March 31, 2025
 are approximately $
145.1
 million, $
82.9
 million, $
74.8
 million, $
73.2
 million and $
23.6
 million in fiscal years 
2026, 2027, 2028, 2029 and 2030
, respectively, and $
3.9
 million of further minimum payments thereafter.

Note 15 — Contingencies
Periodically, the Company is involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including government investigations and claims, and other claims and proceedings with respect to intellectual property, breach of contract, labor and employment, tax and other matters. Such matters could result in fines; penalties, compensatory, treble or other damages; or non-monetary relief. A violation of government contract laws and regulations could also result in the termination of its government contracts or debarment from bidding on future government contracts. Although claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the resolution of its current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

The Company has contracts with various U.S. Government agencies. Accordingly, the Company is routinely subject to audit and review by the DCMA, the DCAA and other U.S. Government agencies of its performance on government contracts, indirect rates and pricing practices, accounting and management internal control business systems, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. An adverse outcome to a review or audit or other failure to comply with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards could result in material civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions being imposed on the Company, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, significant customer refunds, fines and suspension, or a prohibition on doing business with U.S. Government agencies. In addition, if the Company fails to obtain an “adequate” determination of its various accounting and management internal control business systems from applicable U.S. Government agencies or if allegations of impropriety are made against it, the Company could suffer serious harm to its business or its reputation, including its ability to bid on new contracts or receive contract renewals and its competitive position in the bidding process. As of March 31, 2025, the DCMA had approved the Company’s incurred costs through fiscal year 2022. The DCAA is currently auditing the Company's fiscal year 2024 recurring incurred cost submissions. The Company's cost accounting practices are examined for compliance with the applicable CAS. Although the Company has recorded contract revenues subsequent to fiscal year 2022 based upon an estimate of costs that the Company believes will be approved upon final audit or review, the Company does not know the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments and if future adjustments exceed the Company’s estimates, its profitability would be adversely affected. As of March 31, 2025 and 2024
, the Company had $
14.8
 million and $
16.6
 million, respectively, in contract-related reserves for its estimate of potential refunds to customers for potential cost adjustments on several multi-year U.S. Government cost reimbursable contracts. This reserve is classified as either an element of accrued liabilities or as a reduction of unbilled accounts receivable based on the status of the related contracts.
Certain matters resolved during fiscal years 2024 and 2023
In July 2022 and September 2023, the Company settled certain pending litigation. Under the terms of the settlement and licensing agreement, the Company receives certain payments, which may vary based on sales of licensed products. The Company received payments and recognized $
41.7
 million, $
99.9
 million and $
55.8
 million as product revenues within the Company's defense and advanced technologies segment during fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and recognized $
7.2
 million and $
6.4
 million as interest income during fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Note 16 — Segment Information

The Company reports its results in 
two
 separate segments consisting of communication services and defense and advanced technologies. The Company's segments are determined consistent with the way management currently organizes and evaluates financial information internally for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Due to the resegmentation that was implemented commencing with the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, prior period segment amounts have been recast to conform to the current segment presentation.
The Company’s reportable segments (communication services and defense and advanced technologies) have been determined based upon their market and economic characteristics while also giving consideration to the structure and management of various business lines. The reportable segments are primarily determined based upon industry categories and core competencies relating to product or service end market distribution, operations, and servicing and distinguished by the type of customer and, to a lesser extent, the related contractual requirements.

The Company’s communication services segment provides a wide range of broadband and narrowband communications solutions across government and commercial mobility markets, as well as for residential and enterprise fixed broadband customers. The Company’s communication services segment revenues are primarily derived from the Company’s aviation services (including IFC services), government satcom services, maritime services (including narrowband and safety of communication capabilities), fixed broadband services, and energy services, as well as a wide array of advanced satellite and wireless products, networks and terminal solutions that support or enable the provision of fixed and mobile broadband and narrowband services.
The Company’s defense and advanced technologies segment develops and offers a diverse array of resilient, vertically integrated solutions to government and commercial customers, leveraging the Company’s technical competencies in encryption, cyber security, tactical gateways, modems and waveforms. The more regulated government environment for defense, encryption and other products is subject to unique contractual requirements and possesses economic characteristics that differ from the communication services segment. The Company’s defense and advanced technologies segment revenues are primarily derived from the Company’s information security and cyber defense, space and mission systems, tactical networking, and advanced technologies and other, products and services, which are provided to government and commercial customers.
The Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the Company's 
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
. 
Segment operating profits (losses) are the primary measure used by the Company's CODM to evaluate segment operating performance. The CODM regularly reviews budget-to-actual variances of segment operating profits (losses) when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources to each segment.
