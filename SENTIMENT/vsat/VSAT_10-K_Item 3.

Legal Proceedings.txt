(L3Harris) in exchange for approximately $1.96 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments (the Link-16 TDL Sale). Unless otherwise noted, discussion throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K relates to continuing operations only and excludes the Link-16 TDL Business. See Note 5 — Discontinued Operations to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Segments
Communication Services
Our communication services segment provides a wide range of broadband and narrowband communications solutions across government and commercial mobility markets, as well as for residential and enterprise fixed broadband customers. In addition, this segment includes the development and sale of a wide array of advanced satellite and wireless products and terminals that support or enable the provision of fixed and mobile broadband and narrowband services. We design, develop and produce space system solutions for multiple orbital regimes, including geostationary earth orbit (GEO), medium earth orbit (MEO) and low earth orbit (LEO).
Our complementary fleet of 23 in service or operational satellites spans the Ka-, L- and S- bands, with 13 Ka-band satellites, eight high-availability L-band satellites (three of which are contingency L-band satellites that are operational but not currently in commercial service), an S-band satellite that supports the European Aviation Network (EAN) to provide in-flight connectivity (IFC) services to commercial airlines in Europe, and an Inmarsat-6 class hybrid Ka-/L-band satellite (the I-6 F1 satellite). In late July 2024, the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite completed in-orbit testing and was integrated into our existing satellite fleet covering the Americas. In May 2025, subsequent to fiscal year end, two Ka-band highly-elliptical earth orbit satellite payloads (GX10A and GX10B) were put in service to provide polar coverage for government customers, with commercial maritime and aviation services anticipated to follow during fiscal year 2026. Furthermore, we have eight additional geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites under development: two additional high-capacity Ka-band GEO satellites (ViaSat-3 F2 and ViaSat-3 F3), three additional adaptive Ka-band GEO satellites (GX 7, GX 8 and GX 9) and three Inmarsat-8 L-band GEO safety service satellites. Our extensive satellite fleet enables us to provide a wide array of high-quality broadband and

narrowband services with near global coverage (including strong oceanic coverage) with greater redundancy and resiliency.
The following are the primary business lines in our communication services segment:
•
Aviation, which includes industry-leading IFC services, narrowband safety operational data services and other complementary services and applications for commercial aircraft, business jets and unmanned aircraft. As of March 31, 2025, we had our IFC systems installed and in service on approximately 4,120 commercial aircraft (of which approximately 90 were inactive at quarter end, mostly due to standard aircraft maintenance) and 2,000 business jets with Ka-band communication services. We anticipate that approximately 1,600 additional commercial aircraft will be put into service with our IFC systems under existing customer agreements with commercial airlines. However, due to the nature of commercial airline contracts and other factors such as OEM delays, there can be no assurance that anticipated IFC services will be activated on all such additional commercial aircraft.
•
Government satcom, which includes various broadband and narrowband products and services for both fixed and mobile communications that provide military and government users with secure, high-speed, real-time broadband and multimedia connectivity in key regions of the world, as well as tactical line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight communications, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) services and L-band Advanced Communications Element (LACE) terminals.
•
Maritime, which includes high-quality, resilient satellite-based broadband and narrowband communications services around the globe to commercial shipping fleets, offshore service vessel operators and commercial fishing companies, as well as NexusWave, a fully managed multi-layer connectivity service for merchant shipping companies. As of March 31, 2025, we provided Ka-band communication services to approximately 14,000 vessels.
•
Fixed services and other, which includes high-speed, high-quality, reliable fixed broadband internet services to businesses and residential users (primarily in the United States as well as in various countries in Europe and Latin America), enterprise connectivity solutions, Internet-of-Things (IoT) and other narrowband services (such as L-band managed services that enable real-time machine-to-machine (M2M) position or high-value asset tracking), energy services, and prepaid internet services that provide innovative, affordable, satellite-based connectivity in communities that have little or no access to the internet. As of March 31, 2025, our U.S. fixed broadband business had approximately 189,000 subscribers with an average monthly revenue per user of $115.       
We believe that growth in our communication services business will be driven in the coming years by the continued surging of demand for global mobility services (such as our aviation and maritime services), reflecting expected continued increases in the number of aircraft and maritime vessels in service, passenger volumes, internet users, applications and connected devices and platforms worldwide, as well as expansion in government satcom services. Commercial global mobility services represent a very large and fast-growing addressable market, and are at the core of our growth strategy in our communication services business. We expect that, as the number of aircraft, maritime vessels and passengers around the globe continue to grow, global mobility bandwidth demands will be able to be effectively and reliably met by our fleet of owned, leased and partner satellites.

Our Strengths

We believe the following strengths position our business to capitalize on attractive growth opportunities in our business:

•
Deep Satellite Fleet Spanning Multiple Frequency Bands. 
Our multi-band satellite platform with 23 in service or operational satellites enables us to provide customers with the services they need to cost-efficiently and reliably meet their connectivity needs, including at peak times in the most congested areas. Customers in our target markets demand high-quality, reliable connectivity services that can meet mission-critical needs at the busiest places and times, backed by robust and measurable service level agreements. Our deep and capital-efficient satellite fleet, with multiple GEO satellites providing near-global broadband and narrowband coverage (including strong oceanic coverage and polar reach), is ideally suited to meet these customer needs – and will be further enhanced by our eight additional GEO satellites under development. Demand for bandwidth is highly geographically concentrated, with 90% of total bandwidth demand estimated to be concentrated in just 15% of the Earth’s surface. Our GEO satellites, with their wide “field of view” and ability to flexibly and dynamically allocate capacity to meet constantly fluctuating bandwidth demands within each satellite’s footprint, enable our satellite platform to reliably and efficiently meet the peak capacity needs of our customers at the busiest times in areas of high congestion, such as airports, ports, major population centers and key transit routes. In addition, the high capacity of our satellites enables us to provide Terabits of capacity at attractive prices. In contrast, a satellite fleet comprised exclusively of LEO satellites typically suffers from a surplus of capacity in low-demand areas, and unreliable or insufficient capacity at times and places of high demand, given each satellite’s very narrow field of view. By leveraging our own satellite fleet and its advantages, existing national operator partnerships, plus coverage and capacity from leading third-party satellites and constellations, our services are designed to provide customers with the essential capacity density, market access, speed, bandwidth and responsiveness they need. Importantly, we have continued to innovate advanced multi-orbit resource management techniques to reduce costs and expand geographic coverage to better serve the unique needs of each mobility and defense customer. In forming key partnerships with multiple geostationary orbit and non-geostationary orbit operators, we are well-positioned to support delivery of Viasat’s next-generation services, improve resource utilization, and drive capital efficiency. In parallel, we are working to ensure equitable access to finite space resources and support regulatory certainty in order to enable multi-orbit solutions and related infrastructure to thrive in a shared and sustainable way.

We believe that our comprehensive and predominately vertically integrated portfolio of satellites, products and services, combined with our ability to effectively cross-deploy technologies between government and commercial segments and across different geographic markets, provides us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in broadband technologies and services. 
•
Diversification of Business Model
. Our business is highly diversified across many different verticals. Our core business includes IFC systems and services for commercial, private and military aircraft around the globe, high-quality broadband and narrowband systems and services for maritime vessels and land mobile users, fixed broadband user terminals and services to consumers and enterprises, and a wide portfolio of broadband, narrowband and cybersecurity information assurance products and services for government and military users. This diversification in product and service offerings, customer base, geography and market segment helps to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in any of the individual markets we serve and to provide resilience in our business performance in times of economic or political disruption. For example, during fiscal year 2021, revenue impacts to our commercial aviation business in our communication services segment resulting from the global disruption in the airline industry caused by the COVID-19 pandemic were offset by strong demand in our fixed broadband services business and other parts of our business.

By taking advantage of our fleet of owned, leased and partner satellites, and the dynamic beam-forming of our newest ones, we can derive and deliver substantially more value from already on-orbit resources. The principal elements of our strategy include:

7

•
Drive Capital Efficiencies
o
Deliver the Most Productive Satellite Systems:
 We are hyper-focused on maximizing the useful bandwidth per total lifetime capital cost of each satellite. We refer to this as “bandwidth productivity” and see this metric as a key factor in determining our return on satellite investment for each satellite we design, develop and build. However, it is our focus to drive productivity and returns at the fleet level that we believe will give us the greatest competitive advantage in serving our customers globally across a diversity of attractive markets. 
o
Drive Efficiencies of Scale and Operations:
 We intend to continue to drive efficiencies in our businesses through our vertical integration and other strategies and increasing scale as we move into new and adjacent geographic, product and service markets. We optimize our satellite systems through our development of an end-to-end platform of next-generation satellites, ground networking equipment and user terminals that enable the provision of a broad array of high-quality broadband and narrowband services. Our deep fleet of GEO satellites provide scale and operational efficiencies through their enhanced ability to efficiently and dynamically match supply and demand through the flexible allocation of capacity by service, time and geography within the satellite footprint, as well as through their near global geographic reach. 
•
Focus on Relentless Execution
o
Maintain Focus on Technology Leadership:
 We continue to focus on strategic research and development (R&D) to bring more efficient, effective and customer-centric high-quality broadband and narrowband communications to the global market. Our continued innovation in satellite system product development has been one of our hallmarks. We intend to maintain our leadership position in satellite systems, technologies and services, while continuing to expand our efforts in wireless communications, cloud networking and security, as well as new and emerging technologies such as direct-to-device and space-to-space communications. Our R&D efforts are supported by a global employee base that includes approximately 3,400 engineers and a culture that deeply values and supports innovation. 
o
Follow Our Path of Proven Performance: 
We have an enviable track record for identifying and bringing to market impactful communications technologies in space systems. For example, ViaSat-1 was the highest capacity communications satellite at the time of its launch; ViaSat-2 almost doubled the capacity of ViaSat-1; and the ViaSat-3 F2 and ViaSat-3 F3 satellites are individually anticipated to have significantly greater data capacity and geographic coverage than our ViaSat-2 satellite and to enable us to deliver affordable connectivity across a large geographic footprint spanning nearly one-third of the globe with a design that has an enhanced ability to flexibly and dynamically allocate capacity to markets where bandwidth usage demands and returns are highest.

•
Continue to Expand into New Markets and Geographies
o
Enter and Disrupt New and Adjacent Markets through Technology Innovation:
 We continue to create or address new and adjacent markets using our technological advancements to disrupt existing business models and drive shifts in target markets and user demand. For example, the technological innovations and power of our proprietary Ka-band satellite network enabled us to disrupt the IFC business model and successfully expand our broadband service offerings into the commercial air market. As the capacity of our satellite systems continues to increase as we bring new ViaSat-3 and GX satellites currently under development into commercial service, we expect the addressable markets for our technologies, products and services to continue to expand. Higher capacity, more flexible satellites, and layers of GEO/HEO satellites covering each region, will allow us to offer a broader array of cost-effective, reliable, high-quality broadband services that can be tailored to different geographic regions and bandwidth usage demands. 
o
Think Beyond Current Customer Requirements to Open New Markets: 
We actively seek to identify market or operational needs that are not currently served by existing communications and encryption products and services, with a view to developing unique or disruptive products and services and creating new addressable markets. In fact, a key component to the continued success of Viasat’s defense business is its expansive portfolio of non-developmental items (NDI), which are designed to rapidly deliver cutting-edge technology solutions well ahead of the traditional government procurement model. Our business model delivers advanced capabilities significantly faster, at lower lifecycle costs and with lower risk to the customer when compared to traditional defense acquisition programs and timelines.  
o
Target International Expansion.
 We have placed tremendous effort in recent years on growing our operations, sales/distribution, customer/partner base and regulatory framework globally, including through the Inmarsat Acquisition, with the addition of Inmarsat's satellite fleet enabling us to provide high-quality broadband and narrowband services with near global coverage (including strong oceanic coverage and polar reach). We continue to believe that international markets provide attractive opportunities for the long-term growth of our business. As worldwide demand for broadband connectivity continues to grow, we expect that our comprehensive offering of next-generation broadband and narrowband satellites, advanced end-to-end communication systems and ground networking equipment and products, and their ability to enable a wide range of cost-effective, high-quality broadband and narrowband services, will be increasingly attractive internationally. Demand profile differs by geographic market, reflecting geographic, economic, political, regulatory and other factors. However, the flexibility, high bandwidth capacity and broad geographic coverage area of our multi-band satellite fleet allow us to tailor our service offerings for the opportunities and needs of different geographic markets.
•
Prioritize the End-User
o
Recognize Connectivity is a Means to an End, not an End in Itself.
 The value of a network is in the applications it enables. With this understanding, we have worked closely with leading edge and content providers (including companies such as Apple, Facebook, and DirecTV, among others) to enhance end-users’ experiences with their online and streaming media services over our network, helping them leverage the potential of making affordable broadband available in places where it has never been. We also work with U.S. Government agencies, major airlines and others on multiple continents to help ensure end-users have satisfying — and affordable — experiences on our network. Our expanded multi-band satellite fleet enables us to provide services with near global coverage (including strong oceanic coverage and polar reach) with greater redundancy and resiliency. In addition, we work with various international governments to help bring digital and social inclusion to their constituents through efficient satellite-enabled services such as our community internet services, which offer community hotspots, home broadband and mobile broadband in unserved and underserved areas using satellite-powered centralized terminals. By making broadband connectivity accessible to millions of people living in regions where traditional terrestrial and wireless internet services were either non-existent or cost prohibitive, we have been able to help generate positive socio-economic impacts — in education, e-commerce, finance, healthcare and more — at lower bandwidth costs.

The customers of our defense and advanced technologies segment include the DoD, the DHS, select other U.S. federal, state and local government agencies, foreign governments, allied armed forces, public safety first-responders, remote government employees, commercial and defense contractors, satellite network integrators, large communications service providers and enterprises requiring complex communications and networking solutions, as well as various defense contractors, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Space Agency, and privately held companies, international organizations and non-government entities that support government businesses worldwide. We enter into government contracts either directly with U.S. or foreign governments, or indirectly through domestic or international partners or resellers, and act as both a prime contractor and subcontractor for the sale of equipment and services to government and defense users.
Revenues from the U.S. Government as an individual customer comprised approximately 18%, 17% and 17% of total revenues for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. None of our other customers comprised 10% or more of total revenues in fiscal years 2025, 2024 or 2023.

U.S. Government Contracts

Substantial portions of our revenues are generated from contracts and subcontracts with the DoD and other federal government agencies. Many of our contracts are subject to a competitive bid process and are awarded on the basis of technical merit, personnel qualifications, experience and price. We also receive some contract awards involving special technical capabilities on a negotiated, noncompetitive basis due to our unique mix of communication products, satellite services, engineering capabilities and technical expertise in specialized areas. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 has encouraged the use of commercial type pricing, such as firm fixed-price contracts, on dual use products. Our future revenues and income could be materially affected by changes in government procurement policies and related oversight, a reduction in expenditures for the products and services we provide, and other risks generally associated with federal government contracts.

We provide products and services under federal government contracts that usually require performance over a period of several months to multiple years. Long-term contracts may be impacted based on when the government appropriated funds are available and to what level, which may result in a delay, reduction or termination of these contracts.

10

Our federal government contracts are performed under cost-reimbursement contracts, time-and-materials contracts and fixed-price contracts. Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for reimbursement of costs and payment of a fee. The fee may be either fixed by the contract or variable, based upon cost control, quality, delivery and the customer’s subjective evaluation of the work. Under time-and-materials contracts, we receive a fixed amount by labor category for services performed and are reimbursed for the cost of materials purchased to perform the contract. Under a fixed-price contract, we agree to perform specific work, which may include product R&D, for a fixed price and, accordingly, realize the benefit or detriment to the extent that the actual cost of performing the work differs from the contract price. In fiscal year 2025, substantially all of our government revenues were generated from fixed-price contracts with the federal government or our prime contractors.
Our allowable federal government contract costs and fees are subject to audit and review by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), as discussed below under “Regulatory Environment — Other Regulations.”

Our federal government contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, at the convenience of the U.S. Government. If a termination for convenience occurs, the U.S. Government generally is obligated to pay for work completed or services rendered and/or the cost incurred by us under the contract, which may include a fee or allowance for profit. Contracts with prime contractors may have negotiated termination schedules that apply. When we participate as a subcontractor, we are at risk if the prime contractor does not perform its contract. Similarly, when we act as a prime contractor employing subcontractors, we are at risk if a subcontractor does not perform its subcontract.

Some of our federal government contracts contain options that are exercisable at the discretion of the customer. An option may extend the period of performance for one or more years for additional consideration on terms and conditions similar to those contained in the original contract. An option may also increase the level of effort and assign new tasks to us.
Our eligibility to perform under our federal government contracts requires us to maintain adequate security measures. We have implemented security procedures that we believe adequately satisfy the requirements of our federal government contracts.

Research and Development

The industries in which we compete are subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards, changes in customer requirements and continuing developments in the communications and networking environment. Our continuing ability to adapt to these changes, and to develop innovative satellite and communications technologies, and new and enhanced products and services, is a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our prospects for growth. Therefore, we continue to make significant investments in next-generation satellite technologies and communications product and services development.

We conduct the majority of our R&D activities in-house and have R&D and engineering staff, which includes approximately 3,400 engineers worldwide. Our product development activities focus on products that we consider viable revenue opportunities to support both of our segments. We incurred $142.4 million, $150.7 million and $128.9 million during fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on independent research and development (IR&D) expenses, which comprise R&D not directly funded by a third party. Funded R&D contains a profit component and is therefore not directly comparable to IR&D. As a U.S. Government contractor, we may also recover a portion of our IR&D expenses, consisting primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, supplies and prototype materials related to R&D programs.

11

Intellectual Property

We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contractual rights. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information through nondisclosure policies, the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements and other security measures. We have registered a number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries and have a substantial number of patent filings pending determination. There can be no assurance, however, that these rights can be successfully enforced in any particular jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contractual provisions has value, the rapidly changing technology environment in the industries we work in (including the internet, networking, satellite and wireless communications industries) and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protections afforded by patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual rights. Accordingly, while these legal protections are important, they must be supported by other factors such as the expanding knowledge, ability and experience of our personnel, and the continued development of new products and product enhancements.

Certain of our products and services include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain these licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us, or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.

Sales and Marketing

We have a sales presence in various domestic and international locations, and we sell our products and services both directly and indirectly through partners, as described below:

•
Communication Services Sales Organization.
 Our communication services sales organization involves both direct and indirect channels and varies based on subscriber and service type. Our commercial aviation offerings are sold direct to airlines, and our business aviation offerings are sold through direct sales and business development personnel as well as through aviation-focused value-added resellers. Our maritime service offerings are sold through direct and indirect value-added reseller partners targeting a variety of maritime commercial prospects. In each case, our focus is to identify business opportunities and develop solutions for the unique needs of each customer segment. Our residential fixed broadband services are primarily sold directly to customers through our Viasat Internet website, sales call centers and active retail dealers, and we utilize extensive dealer networks across the United States, as well as in each country where residential fixed broadband services are offered, to sell such services. Our business internet offerings are sold through a mix of direct sales personnel who work with enterprises and a network of enterprise-focused master agents and wholesale distribution partners. Finally, our community internet services are sold through local distribution partnerships. In addition to our sales force, we maintain a highly-trained service staff to provide technical product and service support to our customers. 
•
Defense and Advanced Technologies Sales Organization. 
Our defense and advanced technologies sales organization consists of direct sales personnel who sell our standard products and services, and business development personnel who work with engineers, program managers, marketing managers and contract managers to identify business opportunities, develop customer relationships, develop solutions for customers’ needs, prepare proposals and negotiate contractual arrangements, as well as sales managers and sales engineers, who act as the primary interface to establish account relationships and determine technical requirements for customer networks. The period of time from initial contact through the point of product sale is varied based on the products and services provided, and can take three years for more complex developments. Products in production can usually be delivered to a customer between 90 to 180 days from the point of product sale. 

12

•
Strategic Partners.
 To augment our direct sales efforts, we seek to develop key strategic relationships to market and sell our products and services. We direct our sales and marketing efforts to our strategic partners, primarily through our senior management relationships. In some cases, a strategic ally may be the prime contractor for a system or network installation and will subcontract a portion of the project to us. In other cases, the strategic ally may recommend us as the prime contractor for the design and integration of the network. We seek strategic relationships and partners based on many factors, including financial resources, technical capability, geographic location and market presence. 
Our marketing team works closely with our corporate and segment leadership, customer account executives, and business development, sales and operations organizations to increase the awareness and value of the Viasat brand through a mix of positive program performance, agile, results-oriented multichannel marketing campaigns that reflect new and evolving customer journeys, public relations, paid and owned media, live and virtual events, and conference speaking engagements that keep the market current on our services, products and features. Viasat products and services, both in the U.S. and internationally, are typically sold under one unified master global brand, using a single logo and visual identity system. Our marketing team also helps identify and size new and adjacent target markets for our products and services, evaluate our customer experience, create awareness of our company and our portfolio of offerings, and generate contacts and leads within these targeted markets.

Competition

The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to solutions that offer higher capacity and speed and other superior advantages. These market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us. In many cases our competitors can also be our customers or partners. Accordingly, maintaining an open and cooperative relationship is important. The overall number of our competitors may increase, and the identity and composition of competitors may change. As we continue to expand our business globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions.

To compete, we emphasize:

•
the high-quality, resilience, reliability, security and broad geographic availability of our service offerings; 
•
our deep understanding of our customers’ unique expectations and requirements and the factors and metrics that drive customer value in our target markets;
•
our extensive insights as to how, where, and when customer demand will intersect with our capacity supply;
•
our proven designs and network integration services for complex, customized network needs; 
•
our demonstrated performance in uniquely challenging environments;
•
the increased bandwidth efficiency offered by our networks, products and services; 
•
our safety certified L-band network enabling robust safety services for aviation, government and maritime customers;
•
our spectrum and market access;
•
our advanced security and information assurance capabilities;
•
the innovative and flexible features integrated into our products and services; 
•
our network management experience; 
•
our end-to-end network implementation capabilities; 
•
the distinct advantages of satellite data networks; 
•
the technical advantages and advanced features of our antenna systems as compared to our competitors’ offerings; 
•
our holistic suite of offerings, including our ability to offer bundled complex and complementary services, products and solutions; and
•
the overall cost-effectiveness of our communications systems, products and services.
While we believe we compete successfully on each of these factors, we expect to continue to face intense competition in each of our markets.

13

In our communication service segment, our aviation service offerings compete against air-to-ground mobile services and other satellite-based services, such as the services offered by Anuvu, Gogo, Intelsat, Iridium, Kuiper, Panasonic Avionics Corporation, SES, SpaceX and Thales Group, among others. Our maritime service offerings compete against KVH, SES, SpaceX and Speedcast, among others. In our fixed broadband business, we compete with broadband service offerings from wireline and wireless telecommunications companies, including cable companies, fiber and DSL companies, satellite companies and fixed wireless companies. New entrants, some with significant financial resources and new emerging offerings (including terrestrial and space-based networks, such as LEO and MEO constellations) also compete with our satellite service offerings.
In our defense and advanced technology segment, we compete with numerous other providers of satellite and terrestrial communications systems, products and equipment, including: CPI Antenna Systems Division, Comtech, EchoStar (Hughes Network Systems), General Dynamics, Gilat, iDirect Technologies, L3Harris, Maxar, Newtec, Panasonic Avionics Corporation, Safran Aerosystems, SpaceX and Thales Group. In addition, some of our customers continuously evaluate whether to develop and manufacture their own products and could elect to compete with us at any time.

The government businesses in both of our segments compete with government communications service providers and manufacturers of defense electronics products, systems or subsystems, such as BAE Systems, Collins Aerospace, EchoStar (Hughes Network Systems), Eutelsat, General Dynamics, Intelsat, Iridium, L3Harris, OneWeb, SES, SpaceX, Telesat and similar companies. We may also compete directly with the largest defense prime contractors, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Technologies Corporation. In many cases, we partner with our competitors, and therefore maintaining an open and cooperative relationship is important.

Many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including strong customer relationships, greater financial and management resources and access to technologies not available to us. Many of our competitors are also substantially larger than we are, may have greater brand recognition, substantial capital resources or more extensive engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do, may have access to spectrum or technologies not available to us, or may be able to offer bundled service offerings that we are not able to replicate. As a result, these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to changing technology or market conditions or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing objective is to produce high-quality products that conform to specifications at the lowest possible manufacturing cost. To achieve this objective, we primarily utilize a range of contract manufacturers that are selected based on the production volumes and complexity of the product. By employing contract manufacturers, we are able to reduce the costs of products and support rapid fluctuations in delivery rates when needed. As part of our manufacturing process, we conduct extensive testing and quality control procedures for all products before they are delivered to customers.

Contract manufacturers produce products for many different customers and pass on the benefits of large-scale manufacturing to their customers. These manufacturers are able to produce high quality products at lower costs by: (1) exercising their high-volume purchasing power, (2) employing advanced and efficient production equipment and capital intensive systems whose costs are leveraged across their broad customer base, and (3) using a cost-effective skilled workforce.

14

Our experienced management team facilitates an efficient contract manufacturing process through the development of strong relationships with a number of different domestic and offshore contract manufacturers. By negotiating beneficial contract provisions and purchasing some of the equipment needed to manufacture our products, we retain the ability to move the production of our products from one contract manufacturing source to another if required. Our operations management has experience in the successful transition from in-house production to contract manufacturing. The degree to which we employ contract manufacturing depends on the maturity of the product and the forecasted production life cycle. We intend to limit our internal manufacturing capacity to supporting new product development activities, building customized products that need to be manufactured in strict accordance with a customer’s specifications or delivery schedules, and building proprietary, highly sensitive Viasat-designed products and components for use in our proprietary technology platform. Therefore, our internal manufacturing capability for standard products has been, and is expected to continue to be, very limited and we intend to continue to rely on contract manufacturers for large-scale manufacturing. Our internal manufacturing capability is dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. We use numerous sources for the wide array of raw materials required for our operations and our products, such as electronic components, printed circuit boards, metals and plastics. Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. We also rely on outside vendors to manufacture specific components and subassemblies used in the production of our products. Some components, subassemblies, and services necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole source supplier or a limited group of suppliers.

Regulatory Environment

We are required to comply with the laws and regulations of, and often obtain approvals from, national and local authorities in connection with the services that we provide. In particular, we provide a number of services that rely on the use of radio-frequency (RF) spectrum, and the provision of such services is highly regulated. National authorities generally require that the satellites they authorize be operated in a manner consistent with the regulations and procedures of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialized agency of the United Nations, which require the coordination of the operation of satellite networks and systems in certain circumstances, and more generally are intended to avoid the occurrence of harmful interference among different users of RF spectrum.

We also produce a variety of communications systems and networking equipment, the design, manufacture, and marketing of which are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we sell such equipment. We are subject to export control laws and regulations, and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations, with respect to the export of such systems and equipment. As a government contractor, we are subject to procurement laws and regulations.

Radio-frequency and Communications Regulation

International Telecommunication Union

The orbital location and frequencies for our satellites are subject to the ITU’s regulations, including its frequency registration and coordination procedures, and its various provisions on spectrum usage. Those procedures are specified in the ITU Radio Regulations and seek to facilitate shared international use of limited spectrum and orbital resources in a manner that avoids harmful interference. Among other things, the ITU Radio Regulations set forth procedures for establishing international priority with respect to the use of such resources, deadlines for bringing satellite networks into use in order to maintain such priority, and coordination rights and obligations with respect to other networks, which vary depending on whether such networks have higher or lower ITU priority.
The ITU Radio Regulations provide allocations or designations for how spectrum can be used for various purposes, and whether such uses operate on a primary or secondary basis with respect to one another. Secondary uses may not cause harmful interference to primary uses and may not claim interference protection from primary uses.

15

On our behalf, various countries have made ITU filings, and may in the future make additional filings, for the frequency assignments at particular orbital locations that are used, or may in the future be used, by our current satellite networks and potential future satellite networks we may build or acquire. In the event that any international coordination process that is triggered by such an ITU filing is not successfully completed, or bringing into use deadlines or requirements are not satisfied, we may be compelled to accept more limited or suboptimal orbital and spectrum rights, to operate the applicable satellite(s) on a non-interference basis, or to cease operating such satellite(s) altogether. The orbital arc is becoming increasingly congested with respect to such ITU filings and the satellite networks operated under those filings.
In addition, the ITU Radio Regulations are subject to change at periodic ITU World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs), and their application is determined by various governing bodies within the ITU. WRCs typically are convened approximately every four years, with the next one scheduled to occur at the end of calendar year 2027. The next WRC is expected to consider various changes to the ITU Radio Regulations that address the terms and conditions under which spectrum is used for satellite and terrestrial purposes, and future WRCs are likely to do the same.

Spectrum

The space stations and ground networks we use to provide our broadband, VoIP, and other services rely on access to spectrum within each country in which we do business. Use of such spectrum is authorized by regulatory authorities within each country (or a regional authority whose jurisdiction over spectrum rights encompasses that country), which determine the terms and conditions for access to and use of that spectrum in that particular country. The terms and conditions for access can and do vary by country, may differ from the ITU Radio Regulations, and may change over time. In particular, the growing demand for both satellite and terrestrial communications services is causing many countries to evaluate how spectrum is used within their borders, and to consider changes in the local terms and conditions for access to and use of spectrum. Those terms and conditions affect, among other things, the extent to which, and how, we must share spectrum with other spectrum users, including terrestrial and satellite uses, and whether we must operate on a secondary basis in some cases. Most of the spectrum on which we rely is shared with other satellite networks, including those operating in different orbits that could cross our orbital location and result in interference conditions. In many countries, portions of the spectrum on which we rely also are shared with terrestrial wireless services.
If the deployment of new terrestrial or satellite networks results in harmful interference into our satellite operations, or if the implementation of those networks under newly adopted terms and conditions constrains or prohibits the types of spectrum uses for which we have planned in a manner that we do not anticipate, such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Broadband Services
We provide high-speed broadband internet access, VoIP, and other services to customers in the United States, as well as in Europe and Latin America, and on aircraft and seagoing vessels travelling around the world. Our provision of these services is subject to a number of legal obligations, including requirements to obtain licenses, authorizations, and/or registrations to provide service in or to a given jurisdiction, implementation of certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement, and open internet requirements. Legislators and regulators often consider changes to existing statutes, rules, and requirements, or prescribe new ones, which could significantly impact the ability to comply, or the costs of complying with, these types of obligations, or that otherwise could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide service in a given jurisdiction.

US Regulation

The commercial use of RF spectrum in the United States is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act). The FCC is responsible for licensing the operation of satellite earth stations and spacecraft, regulating the technical and other aspects of the operation of these facilities, and regulating certain aspects of the provision of services to customers.

16

Earth Stations.
 The Communications Act requires a license for the operation of transmitting satellite earth station facilities and certain receiving satellite earth station facilities in the United States. We currently hold licenses authorizing us to operate various earth stations within the United States, including, but not limited to, user terminals and facilities that aggregate traffic and interconnect with the internet backbone and network hubs. These licenses typically are granted for 15-year terms, and typically are renewed in the ordinary course. Material changes in earth station operations would require prior approval by the FCC. The operation of our earth stations is subject to various license conditions, as well as the technical and operational requirements of the FCC’s rules and regulations.

Space Stations.
 In the United States, the FCC authorizes the launch and operation of commercial spacecraft, and also authorizes non-U.S.-licensed spacecraft to be used to serve the United States. The FCC has authorized the use of our satellites that provide coverage to the United States. The use of these spacecraft in our business is subject to various conditions in the underlying authorizations, as well as the technical and operational requirements of the FCC’s rules and regulations.
Universal Service and Other Broadband Subsidies.
 Certain of our services may constitute the provision of telecommunications to, from, or within the United States, and we are required to contribute a percentage of our revenues from such services to universal service support mechanisms that subsidize the provision of services to low-income consumers, high-cost areas, schools, libraries, and rural health care providers. This percentage is set each calendar quarter by the FCC, and currently is 36.6%. Current FCC rules permit us to pass this universal service contribution through to our customers. The FCC has established universal service funding mechanisms to support the provision of voice and broadband services in certain high-cost areas of the United States. These supporting mechanisms include the Connect America Fund (CAF) and the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF). In addition, under the new Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, funding for broadband service is expected to be distributed by U.S. states and territories under the oversight and administration of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Among other things, certain mechanisms provide, or will likely provide, support to terrestrial service providers under terms and conditions that are not available to satellite-based service providers. Support mechanisms could provide other service providers a competitive advantage in providing broadband services in supported areas, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, Viasat has been awarded $122.5 million in support under the CAF program to serve certain portions of the country, and must comply with federal and state obligations imposed in connection with such support. In July 2024, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the FCC’s universal service fund program as currently constituted violates the non-delegation doctrine under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, which decision is currently under review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
CALEA.
 We are obligated to comply with the requirements of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which requires telecommunications providers and broadband internet access providers to ensure that law enforcement agencies are able to conduct lawfully authorized surveillance of users of their services.

Net Neutrality.
 In February 2015, the FCC adopted new rules intended to preserve the openness of the internet, a concept generally referred to as “net neutrality” or “open internet.” The FCC’s net neutrality rules, among other things, prohibited all ISPs from: (i) blocking access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices (subject to an exception for “reasonable network management”); (ii) impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices (subject to the same exception); (iii) favoring some lawful internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind whatsoever; and (iv) unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging the ability of end users to access content or the ability of content providers to access end users (again subject to the exception for reasonable network management). ISPs also were obligated to make certain disclosures to consumers with respect to their network management policies.

In adopting these rules, the FCC relied on Title II of the Communications Act, which authorizes the FCC to regulate telecommunications common carriers. More specifically, the FCC reclassified mass-market retail broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service” subject to common-carrier regulation under Title II, reversing longstanding precedent classifying broadband as a lightly regulated “information service” 
not 
subject to such regulation. Such common-carrier regulation potentially could have included review of the reasonableness of an ISP’s rates and practices.

17

In January 2018, the FCC adopted an order restoring the classification of broadband internet access service as a lightly regulated information service, ending the Title II regulatory approach adopted in 2015. The order eliminated explicit requirements against blocking or throttling traffic and paid prioritization of traffic. At the same time, the FCC maintained the consumer disclosure requirements with some modifications and acknowledged the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission to enforce consumer protection measures. The 2018 order was largely upheld by the D.C. Circuit.
In April 2024, the FCC adopted an order largely reverting to the 2015 approach by reclassifying mass-market broadband internet access service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act and re-establishing the prior net neutrality rules. The order also adopted certain additional requirements that were not part of the 2015 framework, such as entry regulation under Title II. The 2024 order was vacated by the Sixth Circuit, and it remains to be seen whether that decision will be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.

In addition, legislative proposals that would impose net neutrality requirements have been considered in Congress, and some states have adopted versions of the net neutrality requirements. A lawsuit challenging California's net neutrality statute was dismissed without prejudice in May 2022, and the California statute is now in effect. Other legislative actions at the state level have been challenged in courts on federal preemption and other grounds. We cannot predict the outcome of these federal and state regulatory and legislative efforts, or any resulting impact on ISPs.

Privacy and Data Security
. We are subject to federal and state laws concerning the privacy of consumers and the security we apply to their personal information. Certain of these laws provide privacy protections for certain types of personal information related to our voice services (referred to by such laws as customer proprietary network information). The Federal Trade Commission also oversees consumer privacy and data security more broadly through its authority to take enforcement action for unfair or deceptive practices, and state consumer protection laws can prompt review of privacy practices by state attorneys general. In addition, certain states have established specific consumer privacy and data security requirements, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act that amended the CCPA in January 2023, which combined give California residents, among other things, the right to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, as well as rights to access, delete, and restrict the sale and sharing of certain personal information collected about them by us and our service providers. State laws similar to those in California continue to multiply and evolve, and as various states pass their own comprehensive privacy laws, we and our business customers and partners could be exposed to additional regulatory complexities and obligations. All states also have enacted security breach notification laws requiring notice to consumers and government agencies upon disclosure of certain information to an unauthorized party resulting from a security breach. In addition, the SEC recently issued enhanced requirements related to the reporting of material cybersecurity incidents, and the FCC likewise has issued data breach notification rules for providers of telecommunications services.
Foreign Regulation
Our operation of spacecraft and ground network and our provision of services to customers outside of the United States are subject to legal requirements of the jurisdictions issuing the satellite authorizations and in which Viasat provides services. These include obtaining the market access, spectrum access and licenses, authorizations and/or registrations that are necessary to operate or provide service in or to a given jurisdiction, and in many cases licenses for the operation of transmitting satellite earth station facilities and certain receiving satellite earth station facilities. In particular, we must obtain authority to operate various earth stations outside the United States, including but not limited to user terminals and facilities that aggregate traffic and interconnect with the internet backbone and network hubs. This authority is subject to conditions and limitations that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

18

The spacecraft we use in our business are subject to the regulatory authority of, and conditions imposed by, foreign governments, as well as contractual arrangements with third parties and the rules and procedures of the ITU. Our ViaSat-1 satellite operates under authority granted to ManSat Limited by the governments of the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom (as well as authority from the FCC), and pursuant to contractual arrangements we have with ManSat Limited that extend past the expected useful life of ViaSat-1. ViaSat-2 and various Inmarsat satellites operate under the authority of the United Kingdom. ViaSat-3 F1 operates under the authority of the United Kingdom and the FCC. We also use Ka-band capacity on the Anik F2 satellite to provide our broadband services under an agreement with Telesat Canada, and we may do so until the end of the useful life of that satellite. Telesat Canada operates that satellite under authority granted to it by the government of Canada. We also currently use the WildBlue-1 satellite, which we own, and which is co-located with Anik F2 under authority granted to Telesat Canada by the government of Canada, and pursuant to an agreement we have with Telesat Canada that expires upon the end of the useful life of Anik F2. Accordingly, we are reliant upon ManSat Limited and Telesat Canada maintaining their respective governmental rights on which our operating rights are based. The use of these spacecraft in our business is subject to various conditions in the underlying authorizations held by us, ManSat Limited and Telesat Canada, as well as the technical and operational requirements of the rules and regulations of those jurisdictions.
We are also subject to certain other forms of foreign regulation in connection with our provision of communications services. In the area of data protection, encompassing both privacy and cybersecurity, we are subject to existing, new, and evolving laws and regulations in the markets in which we operate. For instance, certain of our business units are subject to the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation, which imposes transparency, accountability, data security, cross-border data transfer, and other obligations on Viasat both as a data controller and a data processor of the personal data of individuals in the EU. Data protection laws and regulations can be subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate also impose requirements related to network management practices, cooperation with local law enforcement agencies, and other matters. A smaller number of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted laws enabling the government to suspend ISP services in the country.
Equipment Design, Manufacture, and Marketing

We must comply with the applicable laws and regulations and, where required, obtain the approval of the regulatory authority of each country in which we design, manufacture, or market our communications systems and networking equipment. Applicable laws and regulatory requirements vary from country to country, and jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for these products, generally following extensive investigation and deliberation over competing technologies. The delays inherent in this government approval process have in the past caused and may in the future cause the cancellation, postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communication systems by our customers, which in turn may have a material adverse impact on the sale of our products to the customers.

Equipment Testing and Verification.
 Certain equipment that we manufacture must comply with applicable technical requirements intended to minimize radio interference to other communications services and ensure product safety. In the United States, the FCC is responsible for ensuring that communications devices comply with technical requirements for minimizing radio interference and human exposure to radio emissions. Other regulators perform similar functions around the world. These types of requirements typically provide for equipment to be tested either by the manufacturer or by a private testing organization to ensure compliance with the applicable technical requirements. In some cases, the regulator requires submission of an application, which must be approved by the regulator or a private testing organization accredited by the regulator.

Export Controls.
 Due to the nature and sophistication of our communications products, we must comply with applicable U.S. Government and other agency regulations regarding the handling and export of certain of our products. This often requires extra or special handling of these products and could increase our costs. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial harm to us, including fines, penalties and the forfeiture of future rights to sell or export these products.

Aviation-Related Regulation
Aircraft Modification
. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for the regulation and oversight of civil aviation within the United States. The FAA develops and enforces airworthiness standards and regulations that certify the industry’s ability to manufacture aircraft and aircraft components, perform modification and maintenance activities on aircraft, and repair equipment previously installed on aircraft. We interact with the FAA regarding aircraft modification through two main activities: (1) supporting Type Certificate (TC) activity with an aircraft original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to obtain linefit installation certification of our IFC and W-IFE equipment and (2) obtaining a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) to enable the retrofit installation of our IFC and W-IFE equipment. With respect to TC activity, the OEM is responsible for full certification and FAA regulatory compliance and we are responsible for providing certified equipment to the OEM. With respect to STC activity, we typically use Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) to support holding and maintaining our STCs to ensure FAA regulatory compliance. We also work with OEMs and airlines internationally who are not subject to the FAA's jurisdiction. In those situations, we adhere to the regulations and oversight of comparable foreign agencies in the applicable jurisdictions. Our commercial aviation business depends on our ability to interact with the FAA, comparable foreign agencies and ODAs, as well as certified engineering professionals, in order to access data and obtain authorizations and approvals.

Parts Manufacturing Approval
. We have a wide range of products supporting both commercial and business aviation customers. The FAA, under its Part Manufacturing Approval (PMA) program, provides authorization to entities like us and our vendors to manufacture and deliver IFC and W-IFE equipment. These approvals are provided through assigned FAA Manufacturing Inspection District Offices and are subject to strict rules and ongoing oversight. We have been able to obtain PMA on all of our current IFC and W-IFE product offerings due to multiple agreements with both major OEMs for linefit installations and ODAs for retrofit installations.
FAA Part 145 Repair Stations
. The FAA has approved several of our locations as 14 CFR Part 145 repair stations, which enables us to provide ongoing support to customers with respect to our IFC and W-IFE systems. These repair stations support both line-replaceable unit (LRU) and line maintenance activities associated with our IFC and W-IFE products. These approvals are provided and overseen by FAA Flight Standards District Offices. We have also obtained European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) approval for our repair stations dedicated to LRU repair and maintenance for our IFC and W-IFE products.
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to a variety of U.S. and international regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products. In addition, we could be affected by future U.S. or international laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change, and we monitor developments in environmental and climate-related laws and regulations and their potential impact to our business and financial condition. The failure to comply with current or future laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines on us, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations. To date, the current regulations have not had a material effect on our business, as we have neither incurred significant costs to maintain compliance nor to remedy past noncompliance, and we do not expect such regulations to have a material effect on our business in the current fiscal year.

20

Other Regulations

As a government contractor, we are routinely subject to audit and review by the DCMA, the DCAA and other U.S. Government agencies of our performance on government contracts, indirect rates and pricing practices, accounting and management internal control business systems, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. Both contractors and the U.S. Government agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny. In particular, audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted, increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome. Increases in congressional scrutiny and investigations into business practices and major programs supported by contractors may lead to increased legal costs and may harm our reputation and profitability if we are among the targeted companies. An adverse outcome to a review or audit or other failure to comply with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards could result in material civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions being imposed on us, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, significant customer refunds, fines and suspension, or a prohibition on doing business with U.S. Government agencies. In addition, if we fail to obtain an “adequate” determination of our various accounting and management internal control business systems from applicable U.S. Government agencies or if allegations of impropriety are made against us, we could suffer serious harm to our business or our reputation, including our ability to bid on new contracts or receive contract renewals or our competitive position in the bidding process. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Seasonality

In our communication services segment, we typically see increased demand for our IFC services from airline passengers during peak holiday and summer travel periods, and historically subscriber activity for our fixed broadband services has been influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional retail selling periods (with new sales activity generally anticipated to be higher in the second half of the calendar year). However, IFC service uptake, sales activity and churn can be strongly affected by other factors which may either offset or magnify any anticipated seasonal effects, including the grounding of aircraft, flight disruptions, availability of capacity, promotional and subscriber retention efforts, changes in our resellers, distributors and wholesalers, changes in the competitive landscape, economic conditions, and other factors affecting customer demand.

Results of our government business lines in both of our segments are impacted by various factors including the timing of contract awards (with the second quarter of our fiscal year, for example, typically receiving a greater number of government contract awards) and the timing and availability of U.S. Government funding, as well as the timing of product deliveries and customer acceptance.

ITEM 1A.
 RIS
K FACTORS

You should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes.

Risks Related to Our Satellites and Business
Our Operating Results Are Difficult to Predict

Our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to do so in the future. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Factors and Trends Affecting our Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this report for a discussion of various factors that may cause our quarter-to-quarter operating results to be unpredictable. Any of these or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations that could adversely affect our stock price.

Satellite Failures or Degradations in Satellite Performance Could Affect Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Satellites utilize highly complex technology, operate in the harsh environment of space and are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit. These risks include malfunctions (commonly referred to as anomalies), such as malfunctions in the deployment of subsystems and/or components, interference from electrostatic storms, and collisions with meteoroids, decommissioned spacecraft or other space debris. Anomalies can occur as a result of various factors, including satellite manufacturer error, problems with the power or control sub-system of a satellite or general failures caused by the harsh space environment. Our satellites have experienced various anomalies in the past and we will likely experience anomalies in the future. Any single anomaly or other operational failure or degradation on the satellites we use, including satellites owned and operated by third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Anomalies may also cause temporary outage of service or reduce the expected useful life of a satellite, thereby creating additional expense due to the need to provide replacement or backup capacity, which may not be available on reasonable economic terms, a reasonable schedule or at all. In addition, anomalies or satellite failures or degradations may cause a reduction of the revenues generated by the applicable satellite or the recognition of an impairment loss (such as those we experienced in connection with the launch of our ViaSat-3 F1 and I-6 F2 satellites), and could lead to claims from third parties for damages. Finally, anomalies may adversely affect our ability to insure our satellites at commercially reasonable premiums or terms, if at all. While some anomalies are covered by insurance policies, others may not be covered or may be subject to large deductibles. Although our satellites have redundant or backup systems and components that operate in the event of an anomaly, operational failure or degradation of primary critical components, these redundant or backup systems and components are subject to risk of failure similar to those experienced by the primary systems and components. Moreover, in third-party satellites which we use to provide services we may not have control over the presence and implementation of redundant or backup systems and components. The occurrence of a failure of any of these redundant or backup systems and components could materially impair the useful life, capacity, coverage or operational capabilities of the satellite.

Satellites Have a Finite Useful Life, and Their Actual Operational Life May Be Shorter than Their Mission Life

Our ability to earn revenues from our satellite services depends on the continued operation of the satellites we own and operate or use. Each satellite has a limited useful life, referred to as its mission life. There can be no assurance as to the actual operational life of a satellite, which may be shorter than its mission life. A number of factors affect the useful lives of the satellites, including the quality of design and construction, durability of component parts and back-up units, the ability to continue to maintain proper orbit and control over the satellite’s functions, the efficiency of the launch vehicle used, consumption of on-board fuel, degradation and durability of solar panels, the actual space environment experienced and the occurrence of anomalies or other in-orbit risks affecting the satellite (as discussed above). In addition, continued improvements in satellite technology may make satellites obsolete prior to the end of their operational life.

25

New or Proposed Satellites Are Subject to Significant Risks Related to Construction, Launch and Orbit Raising that Could Limit Our Ability to Utilize these Satellites

Satellite construction and launch are subject to significant risks, including construction delays, manufacturer error, cost overruns, regulatory conditions or delays, unavailability of launch opportunities, launch failure, damage or destruction during launch and improper orbital placement, any of which could result in significant additional cost or materially impair the useful life, capacity, coverage or operational capabilities of the satellite. The technologies in our satellite designs are also very complex, and there can be no assurance that the technologies will work as we expect or that we will realize any or all of their anticipated benefits. We have in the past identified construction-related issues in our satellites. For example, our ViaSat-2 satellite experienced an antenna deployment issue which reduced its output capabilities. Satellite construction and launch activities may be delayed by a number of factors, many of which may be outside of our control. For example, civil unrest in French Guiana caused a delay in the launch of our ViaSat-2 satellite. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic with the resultant construction delays and supply chain disruptions, followed by launch delays caused by both adverse weather events and the scheduling of high priority launch missions, delayed the construction and launch of the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite. If satellite construction schedules are not met or other events prevent satellite launch on schedule, a launch opportunity may not be available at the time the satellite is ready to be launched. In addition, delays in construction or launch could impact our ability to meet milestone conditions in our satellite authorizations and/or to maintain the rights we may enjoy under various ITU filings. A launch failure may result in significant delays because of the need both to construct a replacement satellite and to obtain other launch opportunities. Launch vehicles may also underperform, in which case the satellite may still be able to be placed into service by using its onboard propulsion systems to reach the desired orbital location, but this would cause a reduction in its useful life. Moreover, even if launch is successful, there can be no assurance that the satellite will successfully reach its geostationary orbital slot and pass in-orbit testing prior to transfer of control of the satellite to us. We may also experience issues during orbital placement and testing, such as the reflector deployment issue experienced with the ViaSat-3 F1 satellite or the power subsystem anomaly suffered by the I-6 F2 satellite during its orbit raising phase. The failure to implement our satellite deployment plan on schedule could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Potential Satellite Losses May Not Be Fully Covered By Insurance, or at All

We may not be able to obtain or renew pre-launch, launch or in-orbit insurance for our satellites on reasonable economic terms or at all. A failure to obtain or renew our satellite insurance may also result in a default under our debt instruments. In addition, the occurrence of anomalies on other satellites, or failures of a satellite using similar components or failures of a similar launch vehicle to any launch vehicle we intend to use, may materially adversely affect our ability to insure our satellites at commercially reasonable premiums or terms, if at all.

The policies covering our insured satellites will not cover the full cost of constructing and launching or replacing a satellite nor fully cover our losses in the event of a satellite failure or significant degradation. Moreover, such policies do not cover lost profits, business interruptions, fixed operating expenses, loss of business or similar losses, including contractual payments that we may be required to make under our agreements with our customers for interruptions or degradations in service. Our insurance contains customary exclusions, material change and other conditions that could limit recovery under those policies, and may contain exclusions for past satellite anomalies. Further, any insurance proceeds may not be received on a timely basis in order to launch a replacement satellite or take other remedial measures. In addition, the policies are subject to limitations involving uninsured losses, large satellite performance deductibles and policy limits.

The Markets in Which We Compete Are Highly Competitive and Our Competitors May Have Greater Resources than Us

The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and competition is increasing. In addition, because the markets in which we operate are constantly evolving and characterized by rapid technological change, it is difficult for us to predict whether, when and by whom new competing technologies, products or services may be introduced into our markets. Currently, we face substantial competition in each of our segments. See “Business–Competition” in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a discussion of the competitive environment in each of our segments. Many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including strong customer relationships, greater financial and management resources and access to technologies not available to us. Many of our competitors are also substantially larger than we are and may have more extensive engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to changing technology or market conditions or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products. Additionally, we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent

26

that our competitors are able to secure business or advantageous regulatory treatment through connections with or influence over government officials. Our ability to compete in each of our segments may also be adversely affected by limits on our capital resources and our ability to invest in maintaining and expanding our market share.

Our Success Depends on the Investment in, and Development and Market Acceptance of, New Broadband Technologies and Advanced Communications and Secure Networking Systems, Products and Services
Broadband, advanced communications and secure networking markets are subject to rapid technological change, frequent new and enhanced product and service introductions, product obsolescence and changes in user requirements. For example, the traditional GEO satellite communications industry is experiencing significant disruption from customers' increasing adoption of LEO services, including Starlink, as well as increased reliance on other forms of data transmission, including Wi-Fi and cellular data services. Our ability to compete successfully in our target markets depends on our success in applying our expertise and technology to existing and emerging broadband, advanced communications and secure networking markets, as well as our ability to successfully develop, introduce and sell new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis that respond to ever-changing customer requirements, which depends on numerous factors, including our ability to: continue to develop market-leading satellite technologies (including high-capacity Ka-band satellites and associated ground networks); continue to increase satellite capacity, bandwidth cost-efficiencies and service quality; develop and introduce competitive products, services and technologies with innovative features that differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors; successfully integrate our complex technologies and system architectures; and implement manufacturing and assembly processes and cost reduction efforts.

We cannot assure you that our new technology, product or service offerings will be successful or that any of our offerings will achieve market acceptance. Many of these risks are amplified in new and emerging markets where we do not currently operate or have limited operations, but which we believe present opportunities for international expansion following the launch of commercial service on our ViaSat-3 constellation. The time from conception through satellite launch for a new satellite design may be four years or longer, thereby delaying our ability to realize the benefits of our investments in new satellite designs and technologies. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent us from successfully selecting, developing, manufacturing or marketing new technologies, products or services, which could increase costs and divert our attention and resources from other projects. We cannot be sure that our efforts and expenditures will ultimately lead to the timely development of new offerings and technologies. In addition, defects may be found in our products after we begin deliveries that could degrade service quality, or result in the delay or loss of market acceptance. If we are unable to design, manufacture, integrate and market profitable new products and services for existing or emerging markets, it could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, and impair the value of our common stock.

In addition, we believe that significant investments in next-generation broadband satellites and associated infrastructure will continue to be required as demand for broadband services and satellite systems with higher capacity and higher speed continues to grow. The development of these capital-intensive next-generation systems may require us to undertake debt financing and/or the issuance of additional equity, which could expose us to increased risks and impair the value of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to effectively or profitably design, manufacture, integrate and market such next-generation technologies, it could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, and impair the value of our common stock.
The Global Business Environment and Economic Conditions Could Negatively Affect Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Our business and operating results are affected by the global business environment and economic conditions, including changes in tariffs, interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, rates of inflation, unemployment rates, energy costs, geopolitical issues and other macro-economic factors. For example, high unemployment levels or energy costs may impact our residential customers in our communication services segment by reducing consumers’ discretionary income, and affecting their ability to subscribe for fixed broadband services. Our business and operating results similarly depend on the economic health and willingness of our customers and potential customers to make and adhere to capital and financial commitments to purchase our products and services. During periods of slowing global economic growth or recession, our customers or key suppliers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing or insolvency. Existing or potential customers may reduce or postpone spending in response to tighter credit, reduced consumer demand, negative financial news or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for our products and services. For example, the business and financial condition of our commercial airline customers were materially impacted during the

27

COVID-19 pandemic by the severe decline in global air travel. In addition, supply chain and labor market challenges and inflationary pressures have negatively affected and may in the future continue to negatively affect our performance as well as the performance of our suppliers and customers. Moreover, natural disasters (including those resulting from climate change), political instability, international trade policies, civil unrest, terrorist activity, acts of war, and public health issues could disrupt supplies and raise prices globally which, in turn, may have adverse effects on the world and U.S. economies. Any of these factors could result in reduced demand for, and pricing pressure on, our products and services, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, U.S. credit and capital markets have experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions from time to time. Uncertainty or volatility in credit or capital markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt or equity financing or to refinance existing indebtedness in the future on favorable terms or at all. Any of these risks could impair our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There remains significant geopolitical tensions across the world which have impacts on the global business environment which in turn can have an impact on our own business performance.
Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Other Strategic Alliances May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business; We May Fail to Realize the Anticipated Benefits of Such Transactions
In order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities, from time to time we make strategic acquisitions and enter into joint ventures and other strategic alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as the Inmarsat Acquisition completed in fiscal year 2024. Risks and uncertainties relating to these transactions and any other acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances we may undertake include:

•
the difficulty in combining, integrating and managing newly acquired businesses or any businesses of a joint venture or strategic alliance in an efficient and effective manner; 
•
the challenges in achieving expected objectives, cost savings, synergies and other benefits; 
•
the risk of diverting resources and the attention of senior management from the operations of our business; 
•
additional demands on management related to integration efforts or increased size and scope of our business, including challenges of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations and addressing differences in corporate cultures or management philosophies; 
•
difficulties in the assimilation and retention of key employees and in maintaining relationships with present and potential customers, distributors and suppliers; 
•
the lack of unilateral control over a joint venture or strategic alliance and the risk that joint venture or strategic partners have business goals and interests that are not aligned with ours;
•
costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or contingent liabilities of an acquired business; 
•
delays, difficulties or unexpected costs in the integration, assimilation, implementation or modification of platforms, systems, functions, technologies, infrastructure, and product and service offerings, or in the harmonization of standards, controls (including internal accounting controls), procedures and policies; 
•
the risk that funding requirements may be significantly greater than anticipated; 
•
the risks of entering markets in which we have less experience; and 
•
the risks of disputes concerning indemnities and other obligations that could result in substantial costs. 
Mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and we cannot be certain that our previous or future acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Anticipated growth, cost savings, synergies and other benefits of any such transactions may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Additionally, we may inherit legal, regulatory, and other risks of the acquired business, whether known or unknown to us, which may be material to the combined company. We may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future, and any strategic investments we make may not meet our financial or other investment objectives. Any failure to do so could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our Reliance on U.S. Government Contracts Exposes Us to Significant Risks

Revenues derived from the U.S. Government represent a significant percentage of our total revenues. Therefore, any significant disruption or deterioration of our relationship with the U.S. Government would significantly reduce our revenues. U.S. Government business exposes us to various risks, including:

•
changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies, which may reflect military and political developments; 
•
unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions, and unpredictable order placements, reductions or cancellations; 
•
reductions or delays in government funds available for our projects due to policy changes, budget cuts or delays, changes in available funding, reductions in defense expenditures and contract adjustments; 
•
the ability of competitors to protest contractual awards; 
•
penalties arising from post-award contract audits; 
•
the reduction in the value of our contracts as a result of the routine audit and investigation of our costs by U.S. Government agencies; 
•
higher-than-expected final costs, particularly relating to software and hardware development, for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed price; 
•
limited profitability from cost-reimbursement contracts;
•
unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of deliverables by the customer and contract close-out procedures, including government approval of final indirect rates; 
•
competition with programs managed by other government contractors for limited resources and for uncertain levels of funding; 
•
significant changes in contract scheduling or program structure, which generally result in delays or reductions in deliveries; and 
•
intense competition for available U.S. Government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development. 
We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business, including the establishment of compliance procedures. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts.

Substantially all of our U.S. Government backlog scheduled for delivery can be terminated at the convenience of the U.S. Government because our contracts with the U.S. Government typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties. If we are unable to address any of the risks described above, or if we were to lose all or a substantial portion of our sales to the U.S. Government, it could materially harm our business and impair the value of our common stock.

The funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to congressional appropriations. Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend over several fiscal years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. In the event that appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, or are reduced or delayed, our contract or subcontract under such program may be terminated or adjusted by the government, which could have a negative impact on our future sales and results of operations. Budget cuts to defense spending, such as those that took effect in March 2013 under the Budget Control Act of 2011, can exacerbate these problems. From time to time, when a formal appropriation bill has not been signed into law before the end of the U.S. Government’s fiscal year, Congress may pass a continuing resolution that authorizes agencies of the U.S. Government to continue to operate, generally at the same funding levels from the prior year, but does not authorize new spending initiatives, during a certain period. During such period (or until the regular appropriation bills are passed), delays can occur in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and such delays can affect our results of operations during the period of delay.

Because Our Products Are Complex and Are Deployed in Complex Environments, Our Products as well as Third Party Products on Which We Rely Are Likely to Have Vulnerabilities and Defects that We May Discover only After Full Deployment, which Could Seriously Harm Our Business

We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software, including hardware and software manufactured by third parties. Software typically contains defects or programming flaws that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. In addition, our products are complex and are designed to be deployed across complex networks, which in some cases may include over a million users, and are sometimes integrated with our customers' systems. Because of the nature of these products, there is no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects or vulnerabilities. As a result, our customers may discover errors or defects in our hardware or software, or our products may not operate as expected after they have been fully deployed. If we are unable to cure a product defect, we could experience damage to our reputation, reduced customer satisfaction, loss of existing customers and failure to attract new customers, failure to achieve market acceptance, cancellation of orders, loss of revenues, reduction in backlog and market share, increased service and warranty costs, diversion of development resources, legal actions by our customers, product returns or recalls, issuance of credit to customers and increased insurance costs. Further, due to the high volume nature of our fixed broadband business, defects of products used in this business could significantly increase these risks. Defects, integration issues or other performance problems in our products could also result in financial or other damages to our customers. Our customers could seek damages for related losses from us, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. A product liability claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly. The occurrence of any of these problems would seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, given the complex nature of our systems and technologies, we regularly identify and track security vulnerabilities using scanning tools. We cannot guarantee comprehensively applied patches nor confirm that measures are in place to mitigate all such vulnerabilities or that patches will be applied before vulnerabilities are exploited by a threat actor. If a threat actor is able to exploit a critical vulnerability before patches are installed or mitigating measures are implemented, significant compromises could impact our and our customers’ systems and data, and could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our Reputation and Business Could Be Materially Harmed as a Result of Data Breaches, Data Theft, Unauthorized Access or Hacking

We rely heavily on computer systems, hardware, software, infrastructure and various connected sites and networks for both internal and external operations that are critical to our business (collectively, IT Systems). We own and manage some of these IT Systems but also rely on third parties for a range of IT Systems and related products and services, including for cloud computing services. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, our IT Systems and those of our third-party business partners, including our distributors, business partners, supply chain and other vendors, store sensitive data, including information that is confidential, regulated, proprietary or otherwise sensitive in nature to our business. This information may include intellectual property and product information, personal data, financial information and other confidential business information relating to us and our employees, customers, suppliers and other business partners.
We and our distributors, partners, vendors and customers face numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our respective IT Systems and information, including threats from a wide range of bad actors and malicious parties, such as computer programmers, hackers or sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors, as well as incidents attributable to employee error or wrongful conduct, malfeasance, the exploitation of misconfigurations, "bugs" and other vulnerabilities in hardware or software, or other disruptions caused by sophisticated social engineering and malware exploits (e.g., ransomware).
Despite our security measures, and those of our third-party vendors, we have experienced cyberattacks, data breaches and disruptive incidents, and we remain vulnerable to breaches, attacks and disruptions in the future. For example, in fiscal year 2022, a cyberattack involving our KA-SAT network resulted in a partial interruption of consumer-oriented fixed broadband services in Europe and North Africa. While to date no incidents have had a material impact on our operations or financial results, we cannot guarantee that material incidents will not occur in the future.

Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage IT Systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we are unable to anticipate all threat actor techniques (such as those incorporating artificial intelligence) and are unable to implement absolute preventative measures, particularly given that attackers are increasingly using sophisticated techniques designed to circumvent controls, evade detection, and remove forensic evidence. Any integration of artificial intelligence in our or any third party’s operations, products or services is expected to pose new or unknown

30

cybersecurity risks and challenges. We have also acquired and expect to continue to acquire companies that have cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or unsophisticated security measures, and we face challenges in integrating acquired entities with our cybersecurity program, controls and tools, all of which exposes us to significant cybersecurity, operational, and financial risks with any merger, acquisition or joint venture in which we engage. Additionally, outside parties regularly engage in phishing and other social engineering attacks against our employees or other users of our IT Systems and data. Given the nature of complex systems, software and services like ours, and the scanning tools we deploy in our environment, we regularly identify and track security vulnerabilities. We are unable to comprehensively apply patches or mitigating measures, or guarantee that patches or mitigation will be in place before vulnerabilities are exploited by a threat actor. There can also be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our IT Systems and confidential information.
We may be subject to significant liability to our customers, vendors, business partners, regulators (e.g., civil or criminal penalties) and others, and suffer serious reputational and financial harm if a cyberattack or breach materially disrupts our operations or materially compromises our or our customers’ critical information. If an attack or breach results in material losses of existing and/or prospective customers, it could adversely affect our business relationships, financial condition and results of operations. We could also suffer other negative consequences, including significant remediation costs, significant increased cybersecurity protection costs, loss of material revenues resulting from attacks on our satellites or technology, and the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack.

We cannot guarantee that any costs and liabilities incurred in relation to an attack or incident will be covered by our existing insurance policies or that applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all. Further, if we are unable to comply with the security standards established by banks and the payment card industry, we may be subject to fines, restrictions, and expulsion from card acceptance programs, which could adversely affect our operations.
A Significant Portion of Our Revenues Is Derived from a Few of Our Contracts

A small number of our contracts account for a significant percentage of our revenues. Our five largest contracts generated approximately 18% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2025. The failure of these customers or any of our key distributors to place additional orders or to maintain their contracts with us for any reason, including any downturn in their business or financial condition or our inability to renew our contracts with these customers or obtain new contracts on expiration, could materially harm our business and impair the value of our common stock.

Our Development Contracts May Be Difficult for Us to Comply with and May Expose Us to Third-Party Claims for Damages, and We May Experience Losses from Fixed-Price Contrac
ts
We are often party to government and commercial contracts involving the development of new products. We derived approximately 11% of our total revenues for fiscal year 2025 from these development contracts. These contracts typically contain strict performance obligations and project milestones. We cannot assure you we will comply with these performance obligations or meet these project milestones in the future. If we are unable to do so, our customers may terminate these contracts and, under some circumstances, recover damages or other penalties from us. We are not currently, nor have we always been, in compliance with all outstanding performance obligations and project milestones in our contracts. We cannot assure you that the other parties to any such contract will not terminate the contract or seek damages from us. If other parties elect to terminate their contracts or seek damages from us, it could materially harm our business and impair the value of our common stock.

Substantially all of our revenues are derived from contracts with fixed prices. These contracts carry the risk of potential cost overruns because we assume all of the cost burden. We assume greater financial risk on fixed-price contracts than on other types of contracts because if we do not anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixed-price contract, it may significantly reduce our net profit or cause a loss on the contract. In the past, we have experienced significant cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. Because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, a significant increase in or a sustained period of increased inflation, problems with our suppliers and cost overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us over time (which, especially in the case of sharp increases in or significant sustained inflation, could happen quickly and have long-lasting impacts). Furthermore, if we do not meet contract deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. We believe a high percentage of our contract revenue will continue to be at fixed prices in the future. Although we attempt to accurately estimate costs for fixed-price contracts, we cannot assure you our

31

estimates will be adequate or that substantial losses on fixed-price contracts will not occur in the future. If we are unable to address any of the risks described above, it could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, and impair the value of our common stock.
Our Reliance on a Limited Number of Third Parties to Manufacture and Supply Our Products and Supply Network Infrastructure and Bandwidth Exposes Us to Various Risks

We expect our internal manufacturing capacity to be limited to supporting new product development activities, building customized products that need to be manufactured in strict accordance with a customer’s specifications or delivery schedules, and building proprietary, highly sensitive Viasat-designed products and components for use in our proprietary technology platform. Therefore, our internal manufacturing capacity has been, and is expected to continue to be, very limited and we intend to continue to rely on contract manufacturers to produce the majority of our products. In addition, some components, subassemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole source supplier or a limited group of suppliers.

Our reliance on contract manufacturers and on sole source suppliers or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks. We may not be able to obtain an adequate supply of required components, and our control over the price, timely delivery, reliability and quality of finished products may be reduced. The process of manufacturing our products and some of our components and subassemblies is extremely complex. We have in the past experienced and may in the future experience delays in the delivery of and quality problems with products and components and subassemblies from vendors. Some of the suppliers we rely upon have relatively limited financial and other resources. Significant events such as an outbreak of a pandemic such as COVID-19, natural disasters or extreme weather events (including as a result of climate change), acts of terrorism or civil unrest, cyberattacks, labor market instability, changes to trade policy by the U.S. or foreign governments, including tariff and customs regulations or global shortages of components or materials may cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chain and distribution systems and/or delays in the delivery of inventory. If we are not able to obtain timely deliveries of components and subassemblies of acceptable quality or if we are otherwise required to seek alternative sources of supply or to substitute alternative technology, or to manufacture our finished products or components and subassemblies internally, our ability to satisfactorily and timely complete our customer obligations could be negatively impacted which could result in reduced sales, termination of contracts and damage to our reputation and relationships with our customers. This failure could also result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs and adversely affect our profitability.

We also rely on third parties to provide network infrastructure and satellite bandwidth that we use to serve our mobility, defense and other customers. If that network infrastructure or satellite bandwidth becomes temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, we may not be able to pursue new business opportunities or satisfy existing customer obligations, which could result in reduced sales, termination of contracts and damage to our reputation. Such an occurrence could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, and impair the value of our common stock.
We Depend on a Limited Number of Key Employees Who Would Be Difficult to Replace

We depend on a limited number of key technical, marketing and management personnel with a longstanding knowledge of Viasat's business to manage and operate our business. In particular, we believe our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, including our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (Mark Dankberg), and those highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes. The competition for these types of personnel is intense, and the loss of key employees could materially harm our business and impair the value of our common stock. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs to attract and retain such employees, or experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our needs for such employees were unmet.

Because We Conduct Business Internationally, We Face Additional Risks, including Risks Related to Global Political and Economic Conditions, Sanctions, Changes in Regulation and Currency Fluctuations

Approximately 31% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2025 were derived from international sales. Conducting business internationally involves additional risks, including unexpected changes in laws, policies and regulatory requirements (including regulations related to import-export control and tariffs); increased cost of localizing systems in foreign countries; increased sales and marketing and R&D expenses; timing and availability of export licenses; political and economic instability, wars, insurrections and other conflicts, such as the ongoing

32

conflict between Russia and Ukraine; issues related to the political relationship between the United States and other countries; fluctuations in currency exchange rates (including their effect on sales denominated in foreign currencies), foreign exchange controls and restrictions on cash repatriation; compliance with international laws and U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including existing and future privacy and cyber-related laws; challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations; difficulties in managing distributors; requirements for additional liquidity to fund our international operations; availability of suitable export financing; ineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries; potentially adverse tax consequences; potential difficulty in making adequate payment arrangements; potential difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; and imposition of taxes, tariffs (including recent U.S. tariffs imposed or threatened to be imposed on other countries and retaliatory actions taken by such countries), embargoes, sanctions and other trade barriers. In addition, some of our customer purchase agreements are governed by foreign laws, which may differ significantly from U.S. laws and we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under these agreements and to collect damages, if awarded. As a result of these and other risks, we may be unsuccessful in implementing our business plan for our business internationally, or we may not be able to achieve the revenues that we expect. If we are unable to address any of the risks described above, it could materially harm our business and impair the value of our common stock.
Due to the global nature of our operations, we are subject to the complex and varying tax laws and rules of many countries and have material tax-related contingent liabilities that are difficult to predict or quantify. We are also subject to tax audits, including with respect to transfer pricing, in the United States and other jurisdictions and our tax positions may be challenged by tax authorities. There can be no assurance that our current tax provisions will be settled for the amounts accrued, that additional tax exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be necessary for any such exposures. Any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Adverse Resolution of Litigation May Harm Our Operating Results or Financial Condition

We are a party to various lawsuits and claims in the normal course of our business. Moreover, significant transactions like the Inmarsat Acquisition are frequently subject to litigation or other legal proceedings, including actions alleging that our Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties to our stockholders by entering into the transaction. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations, including through the possible diversion of company resources or distraction of key personnel. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit, as well as defense costs and efforts even if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Future Sales of Our Common Stock Could Lower Our Stock Price and Dilute Existing Stockholders

From time to time, we raise capital from equity financings and file universal shelf registration statements with the SEC for the future sale of an unlimited amount of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, and other securities. For example, during fiscal year 2017 we sold 7.5 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering, and during fiscal year 2021 we sold 4.5 million shares of our common stock to certain accredited investors in a private placement transaction.
We may also issue additional shares of common stock to finance acquisitions. For example, we issued 46.36 million shares of our common stock as consideration in the Inmarsat Acquisition. Additionally, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are available for future sale pursuant to stock options, warrants or issuance pursuant to our 1996 Equity Participation Plan of ViaSat, Inc. and the ViaSat, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Future issuances of shares may be dilutive to existing stockholders. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future sales and issuances of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued upon the exercise of stock options and warrants or in connection with acquisition financing), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.

We Expect Our Stock Price to Be Volatile, and You May Lose All or Some of Your Investment

The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past. For example, between April 1, 2023 and March 31, 2025, the market price of our common stock ranged from $47.35 to $6.69. Trading prices may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including quarterly variations in operating results (or operating results falling below the expectations of analysts and investors), significant announcements by us or our competitors (including with respect to technological innovations, satellite construction and launch activities,

33

acquisitions and other material transactions), regulatory developments, or changes in market conditions in our industry or the economy as a whole. Any of these events may cause the market price of our common stock to fall. In addition, the stock market in general and the market prices for technology companies in particular have experienced significant volatility that is often unrelated to operating performance. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
We May Not Be Able to Utilize All of Our Deferred Tax Assets
Our deferred tax asset valuation allowances are the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of our deferred tax assets (consisting primarily of U.S. net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible for tax, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards). Current evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were to identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. For the remaining deferred tax assets without valuation allowances (consisting primarily of U.K. and other foreign interest carryforwards subject to annual interest deduction limitations), certain transactions or material changes to our global financing arrangements could limit our right to use the deferred tax assets and make netting against deferred tax liabilities inappropriate, resulting in an increase to our valuation allowance and income tax expense.
Our ability to utilize our U.S. net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income and reduce future cash tax liabilities would be negatively impacted if we were to experience an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In general terms, an “ownership change” can occur whenever the ownership of a company by one or more “5% shareholders” changes by more than 50 percentage points within a rolling three-year period. The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 of the Code is complex and requires significant judgment. Moreover, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding at any time for purposes of Section 382 of the Code may differ from the number of shares that we report as outstanding in our filings with the SEC. In the event that an ownership change occurs, our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards would be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Provisions in Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, under Delaware Law and in Our Credit Facilities May Discourage, Delay or Prevent a Change in Control or an Acquisition of Our Business at a Premium Price

Some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our business, even if a change in control of Viasat would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders and was made at a premium price. These provisions permit the board of directors to increase its own size and fill the resulting vacancies, provide for a board comprised of three classes of directors with each serving a staggered three-year term, authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock in one or more series, and prohibit stockholder action by written consent.

We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. In addition, under each of the indentures (collectively, the Indentures) governing our senior unsecured and senior secured notes (collectively, the Notes), if certain “change of control” events occur, each holder of Notes may require us to repurchase all of such holder’s Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes. Additionally, Viasat’s and Inmarsat’s senior secured credit facilities (collectively, the Credit Facilities) provide for an event of default upon the occurrence of certain specified “change of control” events.

Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business

We May Be Unable to Obtain or Maintain Required Authorizations or Contractual Arrangements
Various types of U.S. domestic and international authorizations and contractual arrangements are required in connection with the products and services that we provide. See “Regulatory Environment.” Compliance with certain laws, regulations, conditions, and other requirements, including the payment of fees, may be required to maintain the rights provided by such authorizations, including the rights to operate satellite networks at certain orbital slots in certain radio frequencies. Failure to comply with such requirements, or comply in a timely manner, could lead to the loss of such authorizations and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

34

We currently hold authorizations to, among other things, operate various satellite earth stations (including, but not limited to, user terminals, facilities that interconnect with the internet backbone, and network hubs) and operate satellite space stations and/or use those space stations to provide service to certain jurisdictions. Such authorizations are conditioned upon meeting certain milestone conditions and/or due diligence requirements, which, if not met or extended, could result in loss of the authorization. While we anticipate that these authorizations will be extended or renewed in the ordinary course to the extent that they otherwise would expire, or replaced by authorizations covering more advanced facilities, we can provide no assurance that this will be the case. Our inability to timely obtain or maintain such authorizations could delay or preclude our operation of such satellites or our provision of products and services that rely upon such satellites. Further, changes to the laws and regulations under which we operate could adversely affect our ability to obtain or maintain authorizations. Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The spacecraft we use in our business are subject to the regulatory authority of, and conditions imposed by, foreign governments, as well as contractual arrangements with third parties and the regulations and procedures of the ITU governing access to orbital and spectrum rights and the international coordination of satellite networks. The use of spacecraft in our business is subject to various conditions in the underlying authorizations held by us and third parties, as well as the requirements of the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we provide service or that govern our network operations. Any failure to meet these types of requirements in a timely manner, maintain our contractual arrangements, obtain or maintain our authorizations, or manage potential conflicts with the orbital slot rights afforded to third parties could lead to us losing our rights to operate from these orbital locations or may otherwise require us to modify or limit our operations from these locations, which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate a satellite at full capacity or at all, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Changes in the Regulatory Environment Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our Competitive Position, Growth and Financial Performance

Our business is highly regulated. We are subject to the regulatory authority of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Those authorities regulate, among other things, the launch and operation of satellites, the use of RF spectrum, the ability to operate satellites at specific orbital locations in space, the licensing of earth stations and other radio transmitters, the provision of communications services, privacy and data security, and the design, manufacture, and marketing of communications systems and networking infrastructure. The space stations and ground network we use to provide our broadband and other services operate using some spectrum that is regulated for use on a primary basis for certain types of the satellite services we provide, some spectrum that is regulated for use on a shared basis with terrestrial wireless services and/or other satellite technologies, and some spectrum that is regulated primarily for terrestrial wireless and other uses but that we are authorized to use on a secondary or non-interference basis. Moreover, spectrum availability varies from country to country, and even within countries, within our service areas.
Laws and regulations affecting our business are subject to change in response to industry developments, new technology, and political considerations, among other things. Legislators and regulatory authorities in various countries are considering, and may in the future adopt, new laws, policies, and regulations, as well as changes to existing laws, policies and regulations. We cannot predict when or whether applicable laws, policies, or regulations may come into effect or change, or what the cost and time necessary to comply with such new or updated laws or regulations may be. For example, cybersecurity and data privacy security and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which may increase our costs, affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties.
Changes in laws or regulations, including changes in the way spectrum is regulated and/or in regulations governing our products and services, changes in the way spectrum is made available to us or is allowed to be used by others, or changes in the regulation of competing uses of spectrum or orbital locations, could, directly or indirectly, affect our operations or the operations of our distribution partners, increase the cost of providing our products and services, and make our products and services less competitive. Some regulators are considering new or additional terrestrial services in the spectrum in which we operate, which may not be compatible with the way we use, or plan to use, that same spectrum. In certain instances, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Among other things, changes to laws and regulations could materially harm our business by (1) affecting our ability to obtain or retain required governmental authorizations, (2) restricting our ability to provide certain products or services, (3) restricting development efforts by us and our customers, (4) making our current products and services less attractive or obsolete, (5) increasing our operational costs, or (6) making it easier or less expensive

for our competitors to compete with us. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in the imposition of financial penalties against us, the adverse modification or cancellation of required authorizations, or other material adverse actions. Any such matters could materially harm our business and impair the value of our common stock.

Our International Sales and Operations Are Subject to Applicable Laws Relating to Trade, Sanctions, Export Controls and Foreign Corrupt Practices, the Violation of Which Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on Our Business

We must comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. U.S. export and control laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA) and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). The export of certain satellite hardware, software services and technical data relating to satellites is regulated by the U.S. Department of State under ITAR. Certain satellites and other items are controlled for export by the U.S. Department of Commerce under the EAR. In addition, we must comply with trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations, including those administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). We cannot provide certain products and services to certain countries or persons subject to U.S. trade sanctions unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations from OFAC. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act, which generally bar bribes to foreign governments or officials. Although we have in place policies for our respective employees, directors and officers, and we have clauses in our contracts with our distribution partners, resellers and other intermediaries, we cannot be certain that any such activities are not undertaken, and cannot guarantee that our policies and contracts will prevent situations occurring, including actions by distribution partners, resellers and other intermediaries, for which we may be held responsible. Non-compliance with any applicable trade control, sanctions, export control or anti-corruption laws or other legal requirements may result in criminal and/or civil penalties, disgorgement and/or other sanctions and remedial measures, and may result in unexpected legal or compliance costs. Violations of any of these laws or regulations could also result in more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges or loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our business, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, any investigation of alleged violations of any such laws could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our Business Could Be Adversely Affected by a Negative Audit by the U.S. Government and other Governments
As a government contractor, we are routinely subject to audit and review by the DCMA, the DCAA and other U.S. Government agencies of our performance on government contracts, indirect rates and pricing practices, accounting and management internal control business systems, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. Audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted, increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome. Increases in congressional scrutiny and investigations into business practices and major programs supported by contractors may lead to increased legal costs and may harm our reputation and profitability if we are among the targeted companies.

An adverse outcome to a review or audit or other failure to comply with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards could result in material civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions being imposed on us, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, significant customer refunds, fines and suspension, or a prohibition on doing business with U.S. Government agencies. In addition, if we fail to obtain an “adequate” determination of our various accounting and management internal control business systems from applicable U.S. Government agencies or if allegations of impropriety are made against us, we could suffer serious harm to our business or our reputation, including our ability to bid on new contracts or receive contract renewals and our competitive position in the bidding process. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are also subject to audit from time to time by other governments, including by the U.K. Government in respect of the package of economic undertakings agreed to by us and Inmarsat with the UK Government’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in March 2022, and an adverse review may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Associated with Environmental, Social and Governance Matters, Including Global Climate Change, and Legal, Regulatory or Market Responses to These Matters Could Harm Our Reputation and Business
In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny by various stakeholders and policymakers regarding companies’ management of climate change, human capital, and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. Shareholder ESG expectations, physical and transition risks associated with climate change, emerging ESG regulation (which regulation is not always uniform, increasing the cost and complexity of compliance and associated risks), contractual requirements and policy requirements present short, medium and long-term risks to our business and financial condition. While we engage in various initiatives (including voluntary disclosures) to manage such matters and address stakeholder expectations, such initiatives can be costly and may not have the desired effect. As with other companies, our approach to such matters also evolves, and we cannot guarantee that our approach will align with the expectations or preferences of any particular stakeholder. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations could lead to additional operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us. For example, various policymakers have adopted (or are considering adopting) requirements for certain ESG disclosures or consideration of ESG matters in procurement decisions, among other things. Changes in government procurement laws that mandate or include climate change considerations, such as the contractor’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, lower emission products or other climate risks, in evaluating bids could result in costly changes to our operations or affect our competitiveness on future bids.
Compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may require significant operating and capital costs. Environmental laws and regulations may institute substantial fines and criminal sanctions to address violations and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. Our suppliers may face similar business interruptions and incur additional costs that may be passed on to us. In addition, increasing scrutiny on ESG matters by various stakeholders may have various effects (including, for example, decreased demand for our products and services in the case of decreased air travel). However, stakeholders have different and, at times, conflicting expectations. Proponents and opponents of such matters are increasingly resorting to activism, including litigation, to advance their perspectives. Addressing stakeholder expectations or requirements entails costs and any failure to successfully navigate such expectations may result in reputational harm, loss of customers or contracts, regulatory or investor engagement, or other adverse impacts to our business. If our responses to new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements or other sustainability concerns are unsuccessful or perceived as inadequate for the U.S. or our international markets, we also may suffer damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, many of our customers and other stakeholders are subject to similar such expectations or requirements, which may augment existing or create additional risks. Any of the foregoing could be further exacerbated by changes to laws, regulation, standards and executive orders.
Risks Related to Our Indebtedness
Our Level of Indebtedness May Adversely Affect Our Ability to Operate Our Business, Remain in Compliance with Debt Covenants, React to Changes in Our Business or the Industry in Which We Operate, or Prevent Us From Making Payments on Our Indebtedness

We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of March 31, 2025, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was $7.2 billion (as more fully described in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 below). As of March 31, 2025, we had undrawn availability of $593.3 million under Viasat's $647.5 million revolving credit facility (the Viasat Revolving Credit Facility) and undrawn availability of $550.0 million under Inmarsat's $550.0 million revolving line of credit (the Inmarsat Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the Viasat Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities). Our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:

•
make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, obtain additional debt or equity financing or refinance existing debt on commercially reasonable terms (or at all);
•
increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
•
require us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flows to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, product development, satellite construction, acquisitions and general corporate purposes; 
•
expose us to variable interest rate risk with respect to borrowings under our variable rate Credit Facilities; 
•
limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; 

37

•
place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and 
•
limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions. 
Any of these risks could materially impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, which may include financing relating to future satellites, potential acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances, working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes. If our level of indebtedness increases significantly, the related risks would intensify.

We May Not Be Able to Generate Sufficient Cash to Service All of Our Indebtedness and Fund Our Working Capital and Capital Expenditures or Refinance Our Indebtedness, and May Be Forced to Take Other Actions to Satisfy Our Obligations under Our Indebtedness, which May Not Be Successful

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate cash flow, which are subject to economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings, including under our Revolving Credit Facilities, will be sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness when due, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In the event of satellite failure or loss, amounts recovered under insurance policies may be insufficient to adequately service our debt obligations. In addition, our term loan borrowings are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk, and therefore high prevailing interest rates (as was experienced during fiscal years 2024 and 2025) may adversely impact our levels of interest expense. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative measures may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our Credit Facilities and Indentures restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition, and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to repay or service our indebtedness.
If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, the lenders under our Credit Facilities and the holders of the Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our Credit Facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money and foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings under our Credit Facilities, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in you losing your investment in our company.

Covenants in Our Debt Agreements Could Limit Our Ability to Implement Our Business Plan

Our Credit Facilities and Indentures contain covenants that may restrict our ability to implement our business plan, borrow under our Credit Facilities or secure additional financing, respond to changing conditions, and engage in opportunistic transactions. Our Credit Facilities and Indentures include covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to incur indebtedness, issue redeemable or preferred stock, incur liens, sell or dispose of assets (including capital stock of subsidiaries), make loans and investments, pay dividends, enter into affiliate transactions, reduce our satellite insurance and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person. In addition, our Credit Facilities require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio, as well as financial covenants under the Inmarsat Revolving Credit Facility.
If we default under our Credit Facilities or the Indentures, all outstanding amounts thereunder could become immediately due and payable. In the past we violated covenants in our former revolving credit facilities and received waivers for these violations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with covenants or that any covenant violations will be waived in the future. Any violation that is not waived could result in an event of default, permitting our lenders to declare outstanding indebtedness and interest thereon due and payable, and permitting the lenders under our Credit Facilities to suspend commitments to make any advance or, with respect to the Revolving Credit Facilities, require any outstanding letters of credit to be collateralized by an interest bearing cash account, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we fail to comply with our financial or other covenants under our Credit Facilities or the Indentures, we may need additional financing to service or extinguish our indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. We cannot assure you that we would have

38

sufficient funds to repay all the outstanding amounts under our Credit Facilities or the Indentures, and any acceleration of amounts due would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.
Risks Related to Intellectual Property

Our Ability to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Is Limited

Our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies we use in our products and services. We generally rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws and contractual rights to protect our proprietary rights. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite our efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our proprietary information. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights adequately, our competitors could use the intellectual property we have developed to enhance their own products and services, which could materially harm our business and impair the value of our common stock. Monitoring and preventing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult. From time to time, we undertake actions to prevent unauthorized use of our technology, including sending cease and desist letters. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be required to commence litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. If we are unsuccessful in any such litigation in the future, our rights to enforce such intellectual property may be impaired or we could lose our rights to such intellectual property. We do not know whether the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, including in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as extensively as in the United States. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time and effort required to create the innovative products. Also, we have delivered technical data and information to the U.S. Government under procurement contracts, and the U.S. Government may have unlimited rights to use that technical data and information. There can be no assurance that the U.S. Government will not authorize others to use that data and information to compete with us.

Our Involvement in Litigation Relating to Intellectual Property Claims May Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business

We may be party to intellectual property infringement, invalidity, right to use or ownership claims by third parties or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims. Regardless of the merit of these claims, intellectual property litigation can be time consuming and costly and may result in the diversion of the attention of technical and management personnel. An adverse result in any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Asserted claims or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products, or components thereof. If our products are found to infringe or violate the intellectual property rights of third parties, we may be forced to (1) seek licenses or royalty arrangements from such third parties, (2) stop selling, incorporating or using products that included the challenged intellectual property, or (3) incur substantial costs to redesign those products that use the technology. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain any such licenses or royalty arrangements on reasonable terms or at all or to develop redesigned products or, if these redesigned products were developed, they would perform as required or be accepted in the applicable markets.

We Rely on the Availability of Third-Party Licenses

Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various elements of the technology used to develop these products. We cannot assure you that our existing or future third-party licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our inability to maintain or obtain any third-party license required to sell or develop our products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards, or at greater cost.

Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy and Governance Disclosure
Viasat builds, maintains, and operates satellite and telecommunications systems, infrastructure and services used by both government and commercial customers across the globe. We recognize the importance of building a resilient cybersecurity program focused on reducing cybersecurity risk to our customers, partners and our own organization. Our Cybersecurity Engineering organization, at the direction of the Board of Directors, has developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management and technical assistance program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the services provided and the information stored, processed or transmitted by our critical systems and infrastructure, while assisting staff to develop, operate and maintain secure products and services.
Our Board of Directors considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated governance of cybersecurity and other technology risks to the Audit Committee (the Committee). 
Our executive management is ultimately responsible for assessing and managing risks from cybersecurity threats we face, and in this regard works closely with the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) who reports to our Chief Corporate Officer.

The Committee oversees management’s design and implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program and receives periodic reports, at least semi-annually, from the CISO on cybersecurity risks, the threat landscape, and our cybersecurity planning roadmap.
 In addition, the CISO updates the Committee, as necessary, regarding any material cybersecurity incidents, as well as other relevant incidents and potential or mitigated threats.

The Committee reports to the Board of Directors regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity, and may request the CISO brief the Board of Directors on the status of cybersecurity and risk management programs, as well as relevant incidents and threats. Board members also receive periodic presentations on key cybersecurity topics from the CISO.
Our operational cybersecurity team is led by the CISO. The CISO has 31 years of experience in Information Technology and Security, with extensive experience designing, operating and protecting satellite and terrestrial telecommunications networks. The CISO also leads Viasat’s engagement with the private sector and government security communities, which includes facilitating active information sharing with these partners. As part of the acquisition and continuing integration of Inmarsat, the legacy Inmarsat cybersecurity team joined the Viasat Security Engineering organization. The engineering and operational cybersecurity teams of both legacy organizations jointly participate in local and national cybersecurity organizations, teach classes on cybersecurity, maintain numerous relevant certifications, and participate in training relevant to their field of expertise.
The cybersecurity risk management program at Viasat is centered around an internally developed set of security principles and requirements, known as the “Foundational Security Principles”. The Foundational Security Principles, which we seek to apply across our products and services to promote security resiliency and repeatability, represents a minimum baseline of information security requirements. These principles have a focus on secure-by-design approaches for new products and services, and provide the basis for risk-informed control implementations for legacy networks and systems. Our Foundational Security Principals are designed with reference to the current published version of industry frameworks including, but not limited to, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, International Standards Organization (ISO) 27001, Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-171, and tailored baselines of NIST 800-53. This does not imply that we have implemented each, or any specific, technical standard, specification or configuration embedded in these frameworks but rather that they collectively inform and guide our identification, assessment and management of cybersecurity risks relevant to our businesses. Certain IT environments with higher risk or contractual, regulatory or customer requirements, or those environments where processing or storing sensitive types of information are required, are designed to comply with stricter sets of security requirements or security control frameworks.
Integration efforts continue between legacy Viasat and Inmarsat’s cybersecurity departments. Viasat is actively merging policies, processes, and operations security practices and operational footprints ensuring we have appropriate security tools and solutions that align with our business objectives and security requirements. The combined Viasat and Inmarsat cybersecurity organizations report to Viasat’s CISO and remain focused on the overall Viasat and Inmarsat satellite service network and corporate integration activities.

Functionally, our cybersecurity team performs internal and external risk assessments and testing on both internally and externally developed systems, as well as certain third-party and supply chain partner ecosystems based on our assessment of their respective operational criticality and risk profile. Depending on the risks presented, this may include some combination of manual and automation-driven testing methods and supply chain risk management activities such as hardware and software assurance assessments, anti-counterfeit measures, and the use of trusted suppliers. 
Compliance with security policies, procedures, and standards are assessed, and depending on the potential risks posed to us, third-party assessments may be performed, including penetration tests, red team engagements, gap assessments, and compliance certification assessments. We also conduct several 3rd party compliance and audit assessments, including PCI DSS Tier 1 Merchant and Service Provider, ISO27001, UK Cyber Essentials Plus, and DFARS 252.204-7012 High Assurance assessments.
The cybersecurity team also closely collaborates with our physical security team on planning, risk assessment, and incident response where appropriate, as well as developing and delivering a joint annual security training and education program that 
engages
 our employees, appropriate partners and third parties in a security training program that incorporates both cybersecurity and physical security elements. Additionally, our annual security training program supports additional focused security training for personnel handling certain sensitive information such as payment card information (PCI), controlled unclassified information (CUI), or personally identifiable information (PII).
To better understand Viasat’s threat landscape we partner with multiple U.S. government agencies to acquire and share cybersecurity threat intelligence related to threats, vulnerabilities, indicators of compromise, and current, relevant threat information that are expected as a cleared defense contractor and active Defense Industrial Base (DIB) member. Partner entities include the Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3), Defense Cybersecurity Information Sharing Environment (DCISE), DCMA, National Security Agency Cybersecurity Collaboration Center (NSA CCC), and Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA). Viasat is also an active participant in several Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), including the National Defense (ND-ISAC), Aviation (A-ISAC), and Space (Space ISAC).
Our cybersecurity engineering teams have personnel dedicated to detection engineering activities that leverage threat intel gathered to mitigate the impact of security events. Security detection and operations teams are responsible for detection activities including 7x24 staffed Cybersecurity Operations Centers responsible for monitoring our service provider networks and internal corporate and development environments. Various automated tools are used for detection and remediation, with support from experienced detection and response analysts and engineers.
When security events do occur, we employ a security incident response process that is designed to contain, eradicate, and recover operations as quickly as possible, while preserving forensic evidence for further analysis and potential attribution. We leverage multiple third parties for incident response and forensic support on retainer as necessary to assist during the incident response and remediation phases. We also maintain cybersecurity insurance in the event of cybersecurity related damages or data loss as a result of a cybersecurity incident or unauthorized data disclosure.
During fiscal year 2025, we did not identify risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. We face ongoing risks from certain cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.

Our worldwide headquarters are located at our Carlsbad, California campus and our international headquarters are located in London, United Kingdom. In addition to our Carlsbad campus and international headquarters in London, each of which we lease, we own or lease facilities, offices and earth stations across the globe, including our leased facility in Tempe, Arizona. Each of our segments uses each of these facilities. Although we believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes, in fiscal year 2026 and beyond we will continue to evaluate our real estate needs and may further re-size our real estate footprint (based on utilization and operational needs, or as a part of our continuing integration efforts following the Inmarsat Acquisition, similar to the re-sizing undertaken in fiscal years 2023 and 2024), and/or add additional facilities as needed.
