Overview 
Core Scientific, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” “Core Scientific,” or “Core”) is a leader in designing, building and operating digital infrastructure for high-performance computing. Since our inception in 2018, we have been a premier provider and operator of dedicated, purpose-built facilities and software solutions for digital asset mining for ourselves and our third-party 
44
customers. and in March 2024, we announced the provision of digital infrastructure colocation services to a third party engaged in high-performance computing (“HPC”).
In May 2024, we expanded our relationship with CoreWeave, Inc. (“CoreWeave”) the artificial intelligence (“AI”) hyperscaler, to provide approximately 200 megawatts (“MW”) of digital infrastructure to host CoreWeave’s

HPC operations and provided CoreWeave options with respect to the Company’s existing facilities to provide approximately 500 MW of digital infrastructure on similar terms. In June and August 2024, the Company announced CoreWeave’s execution of options to secure an additional 70 MW and 112 MW, respectively, of infrastructure to host its HPC operations.

In October 2024, the Company announced that CoreWeave had exercised its final option for an additional 120 MW of infrastructure.
These new agreements leverage the Company’s existing digital infrastructure and expertise in third-party hosting solutions. We believe that using our existing infrastructure for HPC hosting operations will provide more consistent dollar-based revenue and represents substantially less risk than our traditional hosted bitcoin mining or our bitcoin self-mining operations. As a result, we intend to focus our business development and marketing efforts on expanding our HPC hosting customer base. As a result, we initiated a significant strategic transition from bitcoin mining to hosting and colocation services for customers employing hosting services for HPC workloads such as artificial intelligence-related applications. 
During 2024, we were substantially engaged in constructing, refurbishing, reallocating or converting a substantial portion of our ten facilities in Alabama (1), Georgia (2), Kentucky (1), North Carolina (1), North Dakota (1), Oklahoma (1), and Texas (3) to support artificial intelligence related workloads, primarily for our one existing HPC customer, but also to support our commitment to meeting the growing demand for HPC solutions and diversifying our revenue streams.
Currently, the vast majority of our revenue is from mining bitcoin for our own account (‘self-mining”). We remain committed to maintaining the efficiency of our digital asset mining while capitalizing on the opportunities presented by the growing HPC hosting business. 
We had an average hourly operating power demand of approximately 572 megawatts (“MW”) for the year ended December 31, 2024. We had secured approximately 1,317 MW of contracted power capacity at our sites as of December 31, 2024. We also operate and manage one of the largest data center infrastructure asset bases among publicly listed North American miners with operational capacity of approximately 784 MW in support of our mining and HPC operations.
Our average self-mining fleet energy efficiency for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 25.1 joules per terahash, compared to 27.9 joules per terahash for the year ended December 31, 2023. Self-mining fleet energy efficiency is a measure of our fleet’s average actual energy efficiency over the period presented.
Our total revenue was $510.7 million, $502.4 million and $640.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. We generated an operating loss of $19.2 million and operating income of $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and an operating loss of $2.11 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. We incurred net loss of $1.32 billion, $246.5 million and $2.15 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) was $157.4 million, $169.5 million and $(11.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “
Key Business Operating Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures
” below for our definition of, and additional information related to Adjusted EBITDA. 
Developments During 2024
CoreWeave HPC Hosting Agreements
On February 29, 2024, the Company entered into a long-term contract with CoreWeave, Inc. (“CoreWeave”) to deliver 16 MW of infrastructure at the Company’s Austin, Texas facility.

Following the commencement of operations in the Austin, Texas facility, on June 3, 2024, the Company entered into a series of long-term contracts with CoreWeave to deliver approximately 200 MW of infrastructure to host CoreWeave’s HPC operations, which will require the Company to modify multiple existing sites. The site modifications commenced in the second half of fiscal 2024 and operational status is expected to begin in the first half of fiscal 2025. On June 25, 2024, the Company announced CoreWeave’s execution of an option to secure an additional 70 MW of infrastructure to host its HPC operations.

Operational status for the additional 70 MW is expected in the second half of 2025. Further, on August 6, 2024, the Company announced that CoreWeave had executed an option to secure an additional 112 MW of infrastructure to host its 
45
HPC operations. On October 22, 2024, the Company announced that CoreWeave had exercised its final option for an additional 120 MW of infrastructure.
Convertible Notes Offerings
On December 5, 2024, the Company completed a private offering (the “2031 Convertible Notes Offering”) of $625.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 (the “2031 Convertible Notes”). The net proceeds from the 2031 Convertible Notes Offering were approximately $608.7 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and the Company’s estimated offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the 2031 Convertible Notes Offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets, or other repurchases of its securities.
On August 19, 2024, the Company completed a private offering (the “2029 Convertible Notes Offering”) of $460.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Convertible Notes”). The net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible Notes Offering were approximately $447.6 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and the Company’s estimated offering expenses. The Company used approximately $62.0 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible Notes Offering to repay in full the outstanding loans under the Exit Credit Agreement, of which $0.8 million was paid for interest. Additionally, the Company used approximately $154.1 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible Notes Offering to redeem all of the outstanding Secured Notes, of which $4.1 million was paid for interest. Further, the Company paid $49.6 million to repay the BlockFi facility in full, of which $0.7 million was paid for interest, and paid $6.5 million to repay the Stonebriar facility in full, of which $0.1 million was paid for interest. The Company intends to use the remaining net proceeds from the 2029 Convertible Notes Offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets, or other repurchases of its securities. 
For more detailed information regarding the 2031 Convertible Notes Offering and the 2029 Convertible Notes Offering conversion, refer to Note 8 — Convertible and Other Notes Payable to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Halving
On April 19, 2024, the Bitcoin protocol executed its fourth planned halving, wherein the bitcoin rewards issued for each solved block declined from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin, reducing the bitcoin received from bitcoin mining by 50% (excluding transaction fee rewards). As a result, revenue generated from bitcoin mining declined, adversely impacting gross profit.
Emergence from Bankruptcy
On January 15, 2024, the Company and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”) the Fourth Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Core Scientific, Inc. and its Affiliated Debtors (with Technical Modifications) (the “Plan of Reorganization”). On January 16, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan of Reorganization. On January 23, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), the conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan of Reorganization were satisfied or waived and the Company emerged from bankruptcy.

Our Business Model 
Business Overview
As a large-scale owner and operator of high-power digital infrastructure for digital asset mining and hosting services, we believe that we are well positioned to serve customers in digital asset mining and an expanding market for HPC operations. As noted in the “Business Strategy” section below, we believe that opportunities for growth exist in various applications of our data centers for third-party customers focused on cloud computing as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence, which has driven our recent expansion into providing HPC hosting services. Furthermore, we believe that the adoption and mainstream use of bitcoin and the blockchain technology on which it is based has accelerated the demand for bitcoin and other digital currencies.
We focus primarily on contracting our digital infrastructure for HPC hosting, and mining and selling bitcoin for cash, enhancing efficiencies in our operations (reducing our cost to mine). Our digital asset mining operation is focused on earning bitcoin by solving complex cryptographic algorithms to validate transactions on specific bitcoin blockchains, which is commonly referred to as “mining.” Our digital asset self-mining activity competes with myriad mining operations throughout the world to complete new blocks on the blockchain and earn the reward in the form of bitcoin.
Our data centers house bitcoin mining computers and will increasingly house graphics processing units (“GPUs”). These specialized facilities lever our specialized design and construction proficiency by employing high-density, low-cost engineering, power designs and modular construction. For digital asset mining, our proprietary thermodynamic structural design manages heat and airflow to deliver best-in-class uptime and, ultimately, increased mining rewards to us and our customers. We are allocating a significant portion of our current and future data centers to support other forms of high-value computing, such as HPC hosting operations, in connection with our short-, medium- and long-term strategic plan. 
Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to grow our revenue and profitability by expanding our existing large-scale data center infrastructure portfolio configured for specialized computers performing specific, high-value applications such as cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and maximizing the portion of our existing infrastructure portfolio contracted for HPC hosting. We intend to continue to strategically develop and make operational the infrastructure necessary to support our existing contractual commitments to our existing HPC customer and to support expected customer growth and additional demand by leveraging our data center expertise and capabilities. We intend to seek additional opportunities and to engage additional customers in the HPC Hosting 
47
segment to expand our business into these areas using our knowledge, expertise, existing and future infrastructure where favorable market opportunities exist. 
Our strategy is focused on hyperscale cloud-based providers and enterprises, including potential customers we believe have significant data center infrastructure needs that have not yet been outsourced or will require additional data center space and power to support their growth and their increasing reliance on technology infrastructure in their operations. We believe our capabilities for serving the needs of large hyperscale providers and enterprises will continue to enable us to capitalize on the growing demand for outsourced data center facilities in our markets and in new markets where our customers are located or plan to be located in the future.
Segments
We have three operating segments: “Digital Asset Self-Mining,” consisting of performing digital asset mining for our own account, “Digital Asset Hosted Mining,” consisting of providing hosting services to third parties for digital asset mining, and “HPC Hosting,” consisting of providing hosting services to third parties for GPU-based HPC hosting operations. Prior to April 1, 2024, we operated only in the Digital Asset Self-Mining and Digital Asset Hosted Mining segments.
Our Digital Asset Self-Mining operation segment generates revenue from the deployment and operation our own large fleet of miners within our owned digital infrastructure as part of a pool of users that process transactions conducted on one or more blockchain networks. In exchange for this activity, we receive digital assets in the form of bitcoin. We began digital asset mining at scale in 2018 and in 2020 became one of the largest North American providers of hosting services primarily for third-party mining customers. We had an average hourly operating power demand of approximately 572 MW for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Our Digital Asset Hosted Mining operation segment generates revenue through the sale of electricity-based consumption contracts for our hosting services, which are recurring in nature. Our Digital Asset Hosted Mining operation segment provides a full suite of services to our digital asset mining customers. We provide deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting, optimization and maintenance of our customers’ digital asset mining equipment and provide necessary electrical power, repair and other infrastructure services necessary for our customers to operate, maintain and efficiently mine digital assets. We do not expect to further expand our Digital Asset Hosted Mining operations in 2025 and future years.
Our HPC Hosting operation segment generates revenue by providing colocation, cloud and connectivity services to customers in exchange for a fee. Our HPC Hosting operation segment provides colocation, facilities operations, security and other services to third-party HPC customers to support workloads for machine learning and artificial intelligence. As of December 31, 2024, we have operational capacity of approximately 784 MW to support of our existing and planned HPC operations.
Mining Equipment 
We own and host specialized computers (“miners”) configured for the purpose of validating transactions on multiple digital asset network blockchains (referred to as, “mining”), predominantly the Bitcoin network. Substantially all of the miners we own and host were manufactured by Bitmain Technologies Limited (“Bitmain”) and incorporate application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) chips specialized to solve blocks on the bitcoin blockchains using the 256-bit secure hashing algorithm (“SHA-256”) in return for bitcoin digital asset rewards.
We have entered into and facilitated agreements with vendors to supply mining equipment for our digital asset mining operations. The majority of our purchases are made on multi-month contracts with installment payments due in advance of scheduled deliveries. Delivery schedules have ranged from one month to 12 months. As of December 31, 2023, we had two active purchase agreements with Bitmain. The first agreement was for the acquisition of Antminer S19J XP miners with a combined exahash of 4.1 or 28,400 miners. The second agreement was for the acquisition of Antminer S21 miners with a combined exahash of 2.5 or approximately 12,900 miners. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had received all of the miners and completed all 2024 payments due on miners ordered for deployment this year.

Performance Metrics 
Hash Rate
Miners perform computational operations in support of digital asset blockchains measured in “hash rate” or “hashes per second.” A “hash” is the computation run by mining hardware in support of the blockchain; therefore, a miner’s “hash rate” refers to the rate at which it is capable of solving such computations. The equipment originally employed for mining bitcoin used the central processing unit (“CPU”) of a computer to mine various forms of digital assets. Due to performance limitations, CPU mining was rapidly replaced by the GPU, which offers significant performance advantages over CPUs. General purpose chipsets like CPUs and GPUs have since been replaced as the standard in the mining industry by ASIC chips such as those found in the miners we and our customers use to mine bitcoin (although they continue to have uses in other industries). These ASIC chips are designed specifically to maximize the rate of hashing operations.
49
Network Hash Rate
In digital asset mining, hash rate is a measure of the processing speed at which a mining computer operates in its attempt to secure a specific digital asset. A participant in a blockchain network’s mining function has a hash rate equivalent to the total of all its miners seeking to mine a specific digital asset. System-wide, the total network hash rate reflects the sum total of all miners seeking to mine each specific type of digital asset. A participant’s higher total hash rate relative to the system-wide total hash rate generally results in a corresponding higher success rate in digital asset rewards over time as compared to mining participants with relatively lower total hash rates.
However, as the relative market price for a digital asset, such as bitcoin, increases, more users are incentivized to mine for that digital asset, which increases the network’s overall hash rate. As a result, a mining participant must increase its total hash rate in order to maintain its relative possibility of solving a block on the network blockchain. Achieving greater hash rate power by deploying increasingly sophisticated miners in ever greater quantities has become one of the bitcoin mining industry’s great sources of competition. Our goal is to deploy a powerful fleet of self- and hosted-miners, while operating as energy-efficiently as possible.
Key Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance
Market Price of Digital Assets
Our Digital Asset Self-Mining segment is heavily dependent on the spot price of bitcoin. The prices of digital assets, specifically bitcoin, have experienced substantial volatility, meaning that high or low prices may have little or no relationship to identifiable market forces, may be subject to rapidly changing investor sentiment, and may be influenced by factors such as technology, regulatory void or changes, fraudulent actors, manipulation, and media reporting. Bitcoin (as well as other digital assets) may have value based on various factors, including their acceptance as a means of exchange by consumers and others, scarcity, and market demand.
Our financial performance and continued growth depend in large part on our ability to mine for digital assets profitably and to attract customers for our digital asset hosted mining services. Increases in power costs, inability to mine digital assets efficiently and to sell digital assets at favorable prices will reduce our operating margins, impact our ability to attract customers for our services, may harm our growth prospects and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Over time, we have observed a positive trend in the total market capitalization of digital assets, which suggests increased adoption. However, historical trends are not indicative of future adoption, and it is possible that the adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology may slow, take longer to develop, or never be broadly adopted, which would negatively impact our business and operating results.
Network Hash Rate
Our business is not only impacted by the volatility in digital asset prices, but also by increases in the competition for digital asset production. For bitcoin, this increased competition is described as the network hash rate resulting from the growth in the overall quantity and quality of miners working to solve blocks on the bitcoin blockchain, and the difficulty index associated with the secure hashing algorithm employed in solving the blocks.
Difficulty
The increase in bitcoin’s network hash rate results in a regular increase in the cryptographic complexity associated with solving blocks on its blockchain, or its difficulty. Increased difficulty reduces the mining proceeds of the equipment proportionally and eventually requires bitcoin miners to upgrade their mining equipment to remain profitable and compete effectively with other miners.  Similarly, a decline in network hash rate results in a decrease in difficulty, increasing mining proceeds.
Transaction Fees
Bitcoin miners receive a transaction fee in the form of a portion of bitcoin for validating transactions on the Bitcoin network.  The transaction fee can vary in value over time, with higher fees prioritizing certain transactions over those with lower fees.  An increase in Bitcoin network transaction fees increases mining proceeds.

Halving
Further affecting the industry, and particularly for the bitcoin blockchain, the digital asset reward for solving a block is subject to periodic incremental halving. Halving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in digital assets using a proof-of-work consensus algorithm. At a predetermined block, the mining reward is reduced by half, hence the term “halving.” A reduction in the number of bitcoins rewarded per block would result in a reduction of revenue to those mining bitcoin, barring any increase in the spot price of bitcoin or decrease in Bitcoin network hash rate or difficulty. Historically, the network hash rate has tended to decline, for a period of time, post-halving as less efficient mining servers become less profitable to operate and their operators discontinue or limit their use.
For bitcoin, our most significant digital asset to which our mining power is devoted, the reward was initially set at 50 bitcoin rewards per block. The bitcoin blockchain has undergone halving four times since its inception, as follows: (1) on November 28, 2012, at block 210,000; (2) on July 9, 2016 at block 420,000; (3) on May 11, 2020 at block 630,000; and (4) on April 19, 2024 at block 840,000, when the reward was reduced to its current level of 3.125 bitcoin per block. The next halving for the bitcoin blockchain is anticipated to occur in 2028 at block 1,050,000. This process will repeat until the total amount of bitcoin rewards issued reaches 21 million and the theoretical supply of new bitcoin is exhausted, which is expected to occur around the year 2140. Many factors influence the price of bitcoin and the other digital assets we may mine for, and potential increases or decreases in prices in advance of or following a future halving are unknown.
Business Mix Shift to HPC
The planned growth of our HPC data center hosting operations business, through increased investment in conversion of several of our bitcoin mining sites to HPC data center hosting sites over the next several years, should gradually reduce our overall exposure to volatility in the spot price of bitcoin as HPC begins to account for a comparatively larger percentage of our financial results. The HPC data center hosting business is characterized by implementation of long-term contracts with customers spanning several years with terms and conditions outlining and resulting in stable, predictable revenue and cash flows over each period.
Electricity Costs
Electricity cost is the major operating cost for the mining fleet, as well as for the hosting services provided to customers and related parties. The cost and availability of electricity are affected primarily by changes in seasonal demand, with peak demand during the summer months driving higher costs and increased curtailments to support grid operators. Severe winter weather can increase the cost of electricity and the frequency of curtailments when it results in damage to power transmission infrastructure that reduces the grid’s ability to deliver power. Geopolitical and macroeconomic factors, such as overseas military or economic conflict between states, can adversely affect electricity costs by raising the cost of power generation inputs such as natural gas. Other events out of our control can also impact electricity costs and availability. In certain power markets, financial hedging can be employed to protect buyers from the financial impact of significant increases in power prices.
Equipment Costs
Increases in the market value of digital assets increases the demand for new miners, which can result in a scarcity in the supply of, and increases in the price of, those miners. Declines in the market value of digital assets can result in excess supply of miners and a general decline in their prices. As a result, the cost of new miners can be unpredictable and could be significantly different than our historical cost for new miners.
51
Our Competition and Customers
In addition to factors underlying our mining business growth and profitability, the success of our HPC hosting business greatly depends on our ability to retain and develop opportunities with our existing customers, secure additional infrastructure and attract new customers. 
Our business environment is constantly evolving.

However, digital asset mining is now dominated by large-scale, industrial miners operating large dedicated facilities around the world, including sovereign nation states with vast resources who mine directly or support mining operations through their sovereign wealth funds, all of whom compete to solve new blocks, acquire new and used miners, and purchase and consume energy and supplies to build mining facilities. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners, the ability to raise capital, obtaining low-cost electricity, obtaining access to sites with reliable sources of high power, and evaluating new technology developments in the industry.

Presently, the information concerning the activities of digital asset miners may not be readily available as most of the participants in this sector do not publish information publicly, or the information may be unreliable. Published sources of information include “bitcoin.org” and “blockchain.info;” however, the reliability of that information and its continued availability cannot be assured.
Based on available data, we believe that an increase in the scale and sophistication of competition in the digital asset mining industry has continued to increase network hash rate, with new entrants and existing competitors increasing the number of miners mining for bitcoin.
Despite this trend, we believe we have continued to maintain a competitive hash rate capacity among both public and private bitcoin miners. However, remaining competitive in our evolving industry, both against new entrants into the market and existing competitors, will require the expansion of our existing miner fleet by purchasing new and available used miners, as well as innovating to develop and implement new technologies and mining solutions.
In HPC hosting, we compete with other providers of high-power data center capacity, such as major data center real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), developers of data centers, hyperscalers and bitcoin miners with capacity suitable for HPC hosting.

This competition focuses primarily on the identification and acquisition of new, high-power sites, but also includes competition for the capital required to build or modify existing sites to support HPC hosting. Additionally, the modification of some of our data centers to accommodate HPC hosting involves the procurement of critical equipment, technologies and skilled labor, which are in high demand from other entities seeking to address the same market opportunity, thereby putting us into competition with many other organizations for those resources.
We believe that because of our operational high-power data center capacity and the experience, knowledge, capabilities and relationships of our data center development and operations team, we are uniquely qualified to address the current strong demand for high-power data center capacity to support HPC applications successfully.

Differentiation, Innovation and Expansion of Our Platform
Our investments in research and development drive differentiation of our service offerings, core technology innovation and our ability to bring new products to market.
We believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering premium products and services, including our ability to manage our power sourcing and construct proprietary, passively-cooled digital asset mining data centers at scale. Our operational digital asset mining facilities lever our specialized design and construction proficiency by employing high-density, low-cost engineering and power designs. Our proprietary thermodynamic solution manages heat and airflow to deliver best-in-class uptime and, ultimately, increases mining rewards to us and to our hosted mining customers. We design our facilities to maximize both the efficiency and lifespan of our mining equipment. We have developed expertise in the installation, operation, optimization and repair of digital mining equipment. We continue to refine and develop our data center design and technology solutions to optimize our operations with the knowledge gained from our considerable digital asset mining experience, including optimizing the location of miners in our data centers to increase profitability. Our approach to data center design enables us to deliver efficiency at scale.
We believe we possess unique knowledge of data center design principles and systems integration architectures, as well as extensive experience designing, constructing and operating data centers that differentiates and informs our plans for modifying digital 
52
asset mining data centers to support HPC hosting, and for developing new data centers designed to support future high-value computing requirements.

This knowledge includes designs for higher rack energy densities than currently offered in the legacy data center market to satisfy emerging requirements for advanced technologies supporting emerging workloads such as artificial intelligence. 
We develop proprietary hardware and software solutions that support our current operations and represent potential future growth opportunities. We intend to continue to invest judiciously in research and development activities to extend our platform management and software solutions in order to manage our infrastructure and mining fleet more efficiently and productively.
Regulation
Due to the relatively short history of digital assets, and their emergence as a new asset class, government regulation of blockchain and digital assets is constantly evolving, with increased interest expressed by U.S. and internal regulators. In October 2020, the Cyber-Digital Task Force of the U.S. Department of Justice published a report entitled “Cryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework” that detailed the Department’s view with respect to digital assets and the tools at the Department’s disposal to deal with threats posed by digital assets. In February 2021, representatives of the government of Inner Mongolia, China announced plans to ban digital asset mining within the province due to the energy and rare earth mineral demands of the industry. In March 2021, the nominee for Chair of the SEC expressed the need for investor protection along with promotion of innovation in the digital asset space. In March 2022, former President Biden signed an Executive Order outlining an “whole-of-government” approach to addressing the risks and harnessing the potential benefits of digital assets and its underlying technology. The executive order lays out a national policy for digital assets over six highlighted priorities. In January 2023, the U.S. House of Representatives created a new congressional subcommittee focused on digital assets, the Subcommittee of Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion, operating under the House Financial Services Committee. 
Most recently, in January 2025, the Acting SEC Chairman announced the launch of a crypto task force dedicated to developing a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto assets, in contrast to the SEC’s prior reliance on enforcement actions to regulate cryptocurrencies. The extent and content of any forthcoming laws and regulations are not yet ascertainable with certainty, and they may not be ascertainable in the near future.
In addition to the activities of the United States federal government and its various agencies and regulatory bodies, government regulation of blockchain and digital assets is also under active consideration by similar entities in other countries and transnational organizations, such as the European Union. State and local regulations within the United States also may apply to our activities and other activities in which we may participate in the future. Other governmental or semi-governmental regulatory bodies have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in blockchain or digital asset businesses. For instance, the SEC has taken an active role in regulating the use of public offerings of proprietary coins (so-called “initial coin offerings”) and has made statements and official promulgations as to the status of certain digital assets as “securities” subject to regulation by the SEC.
Key Business Operating Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our financial results, we use the following business operating metrics and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, and make strategic decisions. For a definition of these key business operating metrics, see the sections titled “Self-Mining Hash Rate,” and “Cost of Self-Mining One Bitcoin and Hash Cost,” (below), and for non-GAAP financial measures, see the section titled “Adjusted EBITDA” (below).

 Represents the cash expense of power and facilities operation cost divided by our self-mining fleet hash rate, in terahash.
Self-Mining Hash Rate
We operate mining hardware which performs computational operations in support of the blockchain measured in “hash rate” or “hashes per second.” A “hash” is the computation run by mining hardware in support of the blockchain; therefore, a miner’s “hash rate” refers to the rate at which the hardware is capable of solving such computations. Our hash rate represents the hash rate of our miner fleet, which drives the digital asset rewards that will be earned by our fleet. We calculate and report our hash rate in exahash per second (“EH/s”). One exahash equals one quintillion hashes per second.
We measure the hash rate produced by our mining fleet through our management software Minder
TM
, which consolidates the reported hash rate from each miner. The method by which we measure our hash rate may differ from how other operators present such a measure.
Generally, miners with a greater hash rate relative to the global Bitcoin network hash rate at a given time will over time, have a greater chance of earning a bitcoin, as compared to miners with relatively lower total hash rates. Further, with the increase in demand for bitcoin contributing to an increase in computational resources for digital asset mining, the global network hash rate has increased, and we expect it to continue to increase. As such, our self-mining hash rate provides useful information to investors because it demonstrates our capacity, and our competitive advantage, for mining bitcoin, which contributes to our digital asset self-mining revenue. Management uses our self-mining hash rate to monitor our performance and competitive advantage in mining bitcoin as global competition also increases.
Our self-mining hash rate was 19.1 EH/s and 16.9 EH/s as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively representing a 13% increase year over year.
Our combined self-mining and customer and related party hosting hash rate decreased 13%, to 20.1 EH/s as of December 31, 2024, from 23.2 EH/s as of December 31, 2023.
Cost of Self-Mining One Bitcoin and Hash Cost 
Our profitability with respect to self-mining is heavily dependent upon our cost to mine a bitcoin, calculated during a particular period as the actual cash expense for power and other mining facility operations cash expenditures attributable to bitcoin self-mined, divided by the total bitcoin self-mined during the period presented. Our cost efficiency with respect to solving computations on the Bitcoin network to mine bitcoin is reflected in our cash-based hash cost, which is calculated as the actual cash expense for power and other mining facility operations cash expenditures attributable to bitcoin self-mined, divided by our self-mining hash rate, in terahash. The Company excludes stock-based compensation and depreciation from calculations of these operating metrics.
Cash Costs per Bitcoin and Cash-Based Hash Cost are key business operating metrics. The cost of self-mining one bitcoin metric provides useful information to investors as it demonstrates our capacity to profitably mine bitcoin when comparing it to the 
54
price of bitcoin, particularly given volatility in energy prices as well as in the price of bitcoin. Management uses this metric to monitor both our cost efficiency in mining bitcoin as compared to our past performance and the performance of competitors, as well as our continued ability to profitably mine bitcoin. Similarly, the hash cost provides useful information to investors as it demonstrates our cost efficiency in solving computations on the Bitcoin network to mine bitcoin. Management uses this information to monitor our cost efficiency in mining bitcoin as compared to our past performance and the performance of our competitors.
Adjusted EBITDA 
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as our net loss, adjusted to eliminate the effect of (i) interest income, interest expense, and other income (expense), net; (ii) provision for income taxes; (iii) depreciation and amortization; (iv) stock-based compensation expense; (v) Reorganization items, net; (vi) unrealized fair value adjustment on energy derivatives; (vii) change in fair value of warrant and contingent value rights; (viii) HPC organizational startup costs which are not reflective of the ongoing costs incurred after startup, (ix) post-emergence bankruptcy advisory costs incurred related to reorganization which are not reflective of the ongoing costs incurred in post-emergence operations, and (x) certain additional non-cash items that do not reflect the performance of our ongoing business operations. For additional information, including the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, please refer to the table below. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure because it allows management, investors, and our Board of Directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period-to-period by making the adjustments described above. In addition, it provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of net interest expense, taxes, certain non-cash items, variable charges and timing differences. Moreover, we have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic and financial planning.
The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature or because the amount and timing of these items are not related to the current results of our core business operations which renders evaluation of our current performance, comparisons of performance between periods and comparisons of our current performance with our competitors less meaningful. However, you should be aware that when evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating this measure. Our presentation of this measure should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual items. Further, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because not all companies calculate this measure in the same fashion. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

Components of Results of Operations 
Revenue
Our revenue consists primarily of digital asset self-mining income, and fees from our digital asset hosting and HPC hosting operations. The Company’s HPC and cloud compute operations began during the second quarter of 2024. 
•
Digital asset self-mining rev
enue. 
We operate a digital asset self-mining operation using specialized computers equipped with ASIC chips (known as “miners”) to solve complex cryptographic algorithms in support of the bitcoin blockchain (in a process known as “solving a block”) in exchange for digital asset rewards (primarily bitcoin). The Company participates in “mining pools” organized by “mining pool operators” in which we share our mining power (known as “hash rate”) with the hash rate generated by other miners participating in the pool to earn digital asset rewards. The mining pool operator provides a service that coordinates the computing power of the independent mining enterprises participating in the mining pool. The pool uses software that coordinates the pool members’ mining power, identifies new block rewards, records how much hash rate each participant contributes to the pool, and assigns digital asset rewards earned by the pool among its participants in proportion to the hash rate each participant contributed to the pool in connection with solving a block. Revenues from digital asset self-mining are impacted by volatility in bitcoin prices, as well as increases in the bitcoin blockchain’s network hash 
56
rate resulting from the growth in the overall quantity and quality of miners working to solve blocks on the bitcoin blockchain and the difficulty index associated with the secure hashing algorithm employed in solving the blocks.
•
Digital asset hosted mining revenue from customers and related parties.
 Digital asset hosted mining revenue from customers and related parties is based on electricity-based consumption contracts with our customers and related parties. Most contracts are renewable, and our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which vary from one to three years in length. During the second quarter of 2023, we initiated our first new digital asset hosted mining customer contracts based on proceed sharing. Under these new contracts, customers pay for the cost of digital asset hosting and infrastructure, and we share the proceeds that are generated. 
•
HPC hosting revenue. 
HPC hosting revenue is generated by licensing data center space and related services to licensees at our Austin, Texas data center. These licensing agreements and orders include lease components, nonlease components (such as power delivery, physical security, maintenance and other billable expenses), as well as noncomponent elements such as taxes. Under these contracts, customers pay fixed payments (based on electric capacity) and variable payments on a recurring basis. HPC hosting power fees are passed through to the customer without markup and are included on a gross basis in HPC hosting revenue.
Cost of revenue
The Company’s cost of digital asset self-mining and digital asset hosted mining services, primarily consist of electricity costs, salaries, stock-based compensation, depreciation of property, plant and equipment used to perform mining operations and hosting services and other related costs. Cost of HPC hosting services relate to our Austin, Texas data center, and primarily consists of facility operations expense, which includes maintenance and lease expense, power fees, payroll and benefits expense and stock-based compensation expense. HPC hosting power fees are passed through to the customer without markup and are included on a gross basis in Cost of HPC hosting services. 
Change in fair value of digital assets
 The Company adopted ASU 2023-08 effective January 1, 2024. Under ASU 2023-08, the Company measures digital assets at fair value with the changes in fair value during the reporting period recognized in change in fair value of digital assets. Recognition of digital asset results prior to adoption are described below.
Gain from sale of digital assets
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-08 effective January 1, 2024, gain from sale of digital assets consisted of the excess of sales proceeds over the carrying value of the digital assets at the time of sale. Gains were recognized as they were realized upon sale(s).
Impairment of digital assets
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-08 effective January 1, 2024, impairment losses were recognized in the period in which the impairment was identified. The impaired digital assets were written down to their fair value at the time of impairment and the new carrying value would not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increase in fair value until sale.
Change in fair value of energy derivatives
The Change in fair value of energy derivatives represents changes in the fair value of the derivative liability related to the energy forward purchase contract described in more detail in “Energy Forward Purchase Contract” in Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Losses on exchange or disposal of property, plant and equipment
Losses on exchange or disposal of property, plant and equipment are measured as the differences between the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment disposed of and fair value of the consideration received upon disposal.  
57
Operating expenses
Operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Each is outlined in more detail below.
•
Research and development. 
We invest in research and development to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our mining operations and hosting services and to support our efforts to capture business opportunities in adjacent high-value computing markets. Research and development costs include compensation and benefits, stock-based compensation, other personnel related costs and professional fees.
•
Sales and marketing. 
Sales and marketing expenses consist of marketing expenses, trade shows and events, professional fees, compensation and benefits, stock-based compensation and other personnel-related costs.
•
General and administrative. 
General and administrative expenses include compensation, benefits, other personnel-related expenses for employees who are not part of our operating sites, research, development, sales, or marketing functions. Also included are stock-based compensation, rent, HPC organizational and site startup costs, post-emergence bankruptcy advisor fees related to the reorganization, professional fees, business insurance, auditor fees, bad debt, amortization of intangibles, franchise taxes, and bank fees. HPC organizational startup costs were primarily consulting costs that were specifically incurred preparing for and entering into the HPC hosting business, and are not expected to be incurred in the ongoing operations of the HPC hosting business. HPC site startup costs are noncapitalizable costs associated with the administration of converting and building of future HPC hosting operating sites, and include compensation and other personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation. Similar costs will be incurred in the future operations of the HPC hosting sites.
Non-operating expenses (income), net:
Non-operating expenses (income), net includes loss (gain) on debt extinguishment, interest expense, net, reorganization items, net, fair value adjustments of convertible notes, warrants and contingent value rights, and other non-operating (income) expenses, net. Reorganization items, net consists of costs directly associated with the reorganization during the bankruptcy period, including professional fees (including reimbursed third-party professional fees) and other bankruptcy related costs, negotiated settlements, satisfaction of allowed claims, and debtor-in-possession finance fees.
Income tax expense
Income tax expense consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets as realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, the timing and amount of which are uncertain and therefore have concluded it is not more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets.
Income tax expense consists of federal and state tax expense on our operating activity, and changes to our deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability.
Deferred income tax expense consists of income taxes recorded using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when these differences are anticipated to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management believes it is not more likely than not to be realized.

Total revenue increased by $8.3 million or 2%, to $510.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $502.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of the factors described below.
Digital asset self-mining revenue increased by $18.4 million or 5%, to $408.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $390.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The year over year increase in self-mining revenue was driven primarily by:
•
a 128% increase in the average price of bitcoin to $65,894 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $28,859 for the year ended December 31, 2023;
•
a 13% increase in self-mining hash rate to 19.1 EH/s for the year ended December 31, 2024, from 16.9 EH/s for the same period in the prior year;
•
an approximate net increase of 6,000 mining units deployed; and
•
and an increase in our average self-mining hash rate fleet mix and efficiency to 25.1 joules per terahash.
This increase in self-mining revenue was partially offset by: 
•
a 52% decrease in bitcoin mined to 6,595 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 13,762 for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven primarily by:
◦
a 50% decrease in block rewards as a result of the April 2024 halving;
◦
the operational shift from digital asset self-mining to HPC hosting; and  
◦
a 66% increase in the twelve-month average network hash rate over prior year.
Total digital asset hosted mining revenue from customers decreased by $24.5 million or 24%, to $77.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $102.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in hosted mining revenue from customers was primarily driven by the termination of contracts with several customers since 2023, due primarily to our shift to HPC hosting.
Total digital asset hosted mining revenue from related parties was nil for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no related-party transactions during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Total HPC hosting revenue was $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to nil for the same period in the prior year due to the initiation of HPC hosting operations at our Austin, Texas data center during the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

As a percentage of total revenue, cost of revenue totaled 76% and 75% for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to:
•
a $21.7 million increase in HPC hosting costs, primarily rent and power incurred during the current fiscal year with no comparable activity for the same period in fiscal 2023;
•
a $16.7 million increase in depreciation expense driven by the increase in the number of miners in service;
•
a $5.9 million increase in payroll and benefits is due to increases in bonuses and salaries driven primarily by an increase in employee headcount; and 
•
a $1.9 million i
ncrease in stock-based compensation expense;
 partially offset by 
•
a $32.0 million decrease in power costs from lower rates and usage and $3.3 million lower facility operations expense.

Impairment of digital assets was nil for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Upon the Company’s adoption of ASU 2023-08 effective January 1, 2024, the Company measures digital assets at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-08, impairment existed when the carrying amount exceeded its fair value. Impairment was measured using quoted prices of the digital asset at the time its fair value was being assessed. Quoted prices, including intraday low prices, were collected and utilized in impairment testing and measurement on a daily basis. If the then current carrying value of a digital asset exceeded the fair value so determined, an impairment loss occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their carrying value and the price determined. The carrying value of our digital assets amounted to $23.9 million as of December 31, 2024, and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2023.

Research and development expenses increased by $4.6 million or 65%, to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was 
driven by a 
$3.1 million increase in payroll and benefits expense due to increases in bonuses and salaries driven primarily by an increase in employee headcount, and a $1.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense
.
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $3.0 million to $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was driven primarily by:
•
a $1.1 million increase in advertising and marketing expenses;
•
a $0.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense; 
•
a $0.5 million increase in payroll and benefits expense due to increases in bonuses and salaries driven primarily by an increase in employee headcount; and
•
a $0.4 million increase in travel and training expense.
General and administrative expenses increased by $16.5 million or 18%, to $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $93.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by:
•
an $18.2 million increase in payroll and benefits expense due to increases in bonuses and salaries driven primarily by an increase in employee headcount to support our transition to HPC operations; 
•
a $5.0 million increase in professional fees;
•
a $4.8 million in post-emergence bankruptcy advisor fees;
•
a $0.9 million increase in property tax;
•
a $0.9 million increase in advertising and marketing; and 
•
a $0.7 million increase in software subscriptions.
This increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by:
•
$12.3 million lower stock-based compensation primarily due to cancellation and forfeitures of equity-based awards during the year ended December 31, 2024, and also due to no new equity awards granted during fiscal 2023; and
•
a $2.2 million decrease in other operating expense primarily driven by decreased business insurance expense.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, $9.1 million of general and administrative expenses are classified as HPC site startup costs. These costs are primarily payroll, benefits, and stock-based compensation for activities related to the startup of our HPC sites that have transitioned from digital asset site operations and administration.

•
the Company’s entry into a warrant agreement and Convertible Value Rights Agreement pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred a $1.37 billion Change in fair value of warrant and contingent value rights due to the increase in the price of the underlying instruments driven by the increase in the Company’s stock price to $14.05 per share as of December 31, 2024, from $3.44 per share as of the Effective Date. The increase in stock price resulted in a $1.45 billion increase in the fair value of the warrant liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2024, partially offset by a $82.1 million decrease in fair value of contingent value rights; and
•
a $20.1 million Gain on extinguishment of debt recognized during the same period in the prior year.
 This increase was partially offset by:
•
a $302.6 million decrease in Reorganization items, net related to a $238.4 million gain associated with the satisfaction of allowed claims, a $70.7 million decrease in professional fees and other bankruptcy costs, and a $24.5 million decrease in debtor-in-possession financing costs, partially offset by a $18.2 million increase in negotiated settlements and a $12.8 million increase in reimbursed claimant professional fees; and
•

Digital Asset Self-Mining
For the year ended December 31, 2024, gross profit in the Digital Asset Self-Mining segment decreased by $4.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting a Digital Asset Self-Mining segment gross margin of 23% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 25% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in the Digital Asset Self-Mining segment gross profit was primarily due to:
•
a $22.6 million or 8% increase in the total cost of digital asset self-mining driven by:
◦
a $19.9 million or 22% increase in depreciation expense, which was driven primarily by an approximate net increase of 6,000 miners placed in service during the current year; and
◦
a $9.3 million or 55% increase in employee compensation due to increases in bonuses and salaries driven primarily by an increase in employee headcount; partially offset by
◦
a $5.0 million decrease in power costs due primarily to lower power rates.
This increase in the total cost of digital asset self-mining was partially offset by:
•
a 5% increase in self-mining revenue driven by: 
◦
a 128% increase in the average price of bitcoin;
◦
a 13% increase in our self-mining hash rate to 19.1 EH/s for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 16.9 EH/s for the year ended December 31, 2023; and
◦
an approximate net increase of 6,000 mining units deployed; partially offset by 
◦
a 52% decrease in bitcoin mined to 6,595 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 13,762 for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven primarily by:
▪
a 50% decrease in block rewards as a result of the April 2024 halving; 
▪
the operational shift from digital asset self-mining to HPC hosting; and
▪
a 66% increase in the twelve-month average network hash rate over prior year.
Digital Asset Hosted Mining 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, gross profit in the Digital Asset Hosted Mining segment decreased by $0.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting a Digital Asset Hosted Mining segment gross margin of 31% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a gross margin of 22% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Digital Asset Hosted Mining segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to:
•
a $34.5 million or 31% decrease in the digital asset hosted mining revenue driven primarily by a $24.5 million decrease from the termination of contracts with several customers since 2023, due primarily to our shift to HPC hosting, and a $10.1 million decrease in digital asset hosted mining revenue from related parties as there were no related party transactions during fiscal 2024, partially offset by:
•
 a $33.7 million or 39% decrease in the total cost of digital asset hosted mining services driven primarily by a $27.0 million decrease in power costs from lower rates and usage.
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the top three hosting customers accounted for approximately 89% and 72%, respectively, of the Digital Asset Hosting’s segment total revenue.
HPC Hosting
For the year ended December 31, 2024, gross profit in the HPC Hosting segment was $2.7 million compared to nil for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to the HPC Hosting segment starting operation during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. HPC hosting revenue includes a base license fee as well as the direct pass-through of power costs to our client, with no margin added. HPC hosting costs at our Austin, Texas data center consist primarily of lease expense, the direct pass-through of power costs, and direct and indirect facilities operations expenses, including personnel and benefit costs and stock-based compensation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Sources and Uses of Cash
We finance our operations primarily through cash generated from operations, including the sale of self-mined bitcoin and fees from licensing HPC data center space, debt issuances, equipment financing arrangements, and sales of equity securities. Although our present needs will likely still result in sales of a significant portion of our self-mined bitcoin, we also may employ strategies intended to optimize cash received from self-mined bitcoin which may entail, subject to market conditions, holding bitcoin for future sale at any particular point in time.
Historically, a substantial portion of our liquidity needs arose from debt service on our outstanding indebtedness and from funding the costs of operations, working capital and capital expenditures. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the Company successfully repaid a significant portion of its outstanding loans, notes, and obligations, issued in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization. This extinguishment of these loans, notes and obligations was achieved either through mandatory conversion events triggered by the Company's stock price or through proactive measures taken by the Company to settle its debts ahead of schedule. In part, the Company used its net proceeds from its 2029 Convertible Notes Offering and 2031 Convertible Notes Offering to extinguish its debt. For further information regarding the extinguishment of the Company’s debt and its private debt offerings, refer to Notes 8 — Convertible and Other Notes Payable and 9 — Contingent Value Rights and Warrant Liabilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
We have assessed our current and expected operating and capital expenditure

requirements and our current and expected sources of liquidity, and have determined, based on our forecasted financial results and financial condition as of December 31, 2024, that our operating cash flows, existing cash balances, and continued access to debt markets will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next twelve months and beyond.

Our principal uses of cash in recent periods have been funding our operations and investing in capital expenditures.
Operating Activities
Changes in net cash from operating activities results primarily from cash received from hosting customers payments for power fees and equipment purchases. Other drivers of the changes in net cash from operating activities include research and development costs, sales and marketing costs and general and administrative expenses (including personnel expenses and fees for professional services) and interest payments on debt.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $65.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a increase in net loss of $1.07 billion, a $194.6 million decrease in working capital components, a $143.8 million increase in non-cash reorganization items, a $82.1 million decrease in the fair value of contingent value rights, a $18.2 million increase in digital asset self-mining and shared hosting revenue, and a $7.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a $1.45 billion increase in the fair value of warrant liabilities, a $20.6 million decrease in loss on debt extinguishment, and a $17.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization.
Investing Activities
Our net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $95.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by a $78.8 million increase in purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $14.0 million of proceeds from the sale of the Cedarvale, Texas facility for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities consists of proceeds from stock issuances, issuances of debt, net of issuance costs and principal payments on debt, including notes payable and finance leases.
68
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $819.6 million. Net cash used by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $44.6 million. The change was due primarily to an inflow of $610.2 million from the proceeds for the issuance of the 0.00% convertible senior notes, net, $447.6 million from the proceeds for the issuance of the 3.00% convertible senior notes, net, $55.0 million from the issuance of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024, and a $20.0 million draw from the Exit Facility. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by an increase in principal payments on debt of $263.8 million. 
Future Commitments and Contractual Obligations
Our material cash commitments from known contractual and other obligations consist primarily of obligations for long-term debt and related interest, leases for property and equipment, and capital expenditures related to the conversion of a significant portion of our data centers to hosting HPC operations. Certain amounts included in our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024, are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors.
Debt Obligations and Interest Payments
As of December 31, 2024, future principal payment obligations on our convertible notes and other notes payable totaled $1.12 billion, of which $17.7 million is expected to be due within one year. Cash payments for expected interest on our convertible notes and other notes payable is $15.8 million within the next twelve months and $56.1 million thereafter. For more information, refer to Note 8 — Convertible and Other Notes Payable, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Operating Lease Payments
As of December 31, 2024, our future payments under operating leases are $151.5 million, of which $18.6 million is due within one year. For more information, refer to Note 7 — Leases, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Capital Expenditure Commitment
As of December 31, 2024, the Company was contractually committed for approximately $1.14 billion of capital expenditures, primarily related to infrastructure modifications, equipment procurement, and labor associated with the conversion of a significant portion of its data centers to deliver hosting services for HPC. Of this amount, $899.3 million is reimbursable by our customer under our agreements. These capital expenditures are expected to occur over the next year. For additional discussion of Commitments and Contractual Obligations, refer to Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Block, Inc. Purchase Agreement

On July 5, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with Block, Inc. for the purchase of 3 nanometer ASIC chips representing approximately 15 EH/s of hash rate. On July 12, 2024, the Company paid a $10.0 million deposit which will be applied evenly towards the ASIC chips. Payments are due in installments, starting six months prior to delivery. Delivery of the ASIC chips is expected to begin by the second half of 2025. On January 15, 2025, the Company made a $21.3 million prepayment under the agreement. The Company expects to make additional payments over the next year in connection with the agreement, subject to the timing of anticipated deliveries.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The critical accounting estimates, assumptions, judgments and the related policies that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.
Revenue From Contracts With Customers - Digital Asset Self-Mining Revenue
The recognition of digital asset mining revenue involves estimation uncertainty due to the variable and non-cash nature of the consideration received. We receive non-cash compensation in the form of bitcoin, less operator fees, for providing hash calculation services to mining pools. These amounts vary based on factors such as our share of the total network hash rate, Bitcoin network block rewards, and transaction fees. Operator fees also fluctuate depending on these rewards and fees.
69
We determine the fair value of this non-cash consideration using the spot rate for bitcoin as quoted on Coinbase Global, Inc., our principal market.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
The Company has made significant investments in Bitcoin mining equipment, which constitutes a substantial portion of its property, plant, and equipment. Accounting for this equipment involves significant judgment and estimation uncertainty, particularly regarding the determination of its estimated useful life for depreciation purposes and the assessment of potential impairment.
The Company depreciates its Bitcoin mining equipment using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of three years. This estimate reflects management’s judgment based on the current state of technology and industry practices. However, the actual useful life of this equipment is uncertain due to the rapid pace of technological advancements in the Bitcoin mining industry. 
The Company evaluates its Bitcoin mining equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the equipment may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the undiscounted futures cash flows expected from its use and disposal. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the asset's fair value. Potential impairment triggers include a significant decline in the market price of Bitcoin or the introduction of new technologies that reduce the efficiency or profitability of the Company’s existing equipment. These assessments rely on significant judgment and require assumptions about future events and conditions, including Bitcoin prices, mining difficulty rates, electricity costs, and anticipated technological advancements.
Management believes that its current estimates and assumptions are reasonable based on the information available. Actual results may differ, and any such differences could materially impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation
The valuation of market condition restricted stock units ("MSUs") involves judgment due to the uncertainty in assumptions used in the Monte Carlo pricing model on the date of grant, which required inputs that were both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement, including estimated volatility, which reflects anticipated variability in the Company’s stock price over time. If we had used different assumptions or estimates, the estimated fair value and expense recognition of the MSUs could have been materially different. Management believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information available.
Contingent Value Rights Liabilities
On the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the Company entered into a contingent value rights agreement  which provided for the issuance of the CVRs to certain creditors. When the CVRs were recognized on the Effective Date, observable market data was not available. The Monte Carlo simulation model was used to determine their fair value, which required inputs that were both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement, including expected volatility, which reflects anticipated variability in the Company’s stock price over time. If we had used different assumptions or estimates, the estimated fair value of the CVRs could have been materially different. At each reporting date subsequent to the Effective Date, the fair value of the CVRs has been determined based on the observable listed trading price for such CVRs, thereby eliminating the significant level of estimation uncertainty in periods subsequent to the initial recognition of the CVRs.
Warrant Liabilities
On the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, holders of the Company’s previous common stock received warrants. When the warrants were recognized on the Effective Date, observable market data was not available. The Monte Carlo simulation model was used to determine their fair value, which required inputs that were both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement, including expected volatility, which reflects anticipated variability in the Company’s stock price over time. If we had used different assumptions or estimates, the estimated fair value of the warrants could have been materially different. At each reporting date subsequent to the Effective Date, the fair value of the warrants has been determined based on the observable listed trading price for such warrants, thereby eliminating the significant level of estimation uncertainty in periods subsequent to the initial recognition of the warrants.
70
Liabilities Subject to Compromise
As a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the payment of pre-petition liabilities was subject to compromise or other treatment pursuant to a plan of reorganization. The determination of how liabilities were ultimately settled or treated was determined by the confirmed Chapter 11 plan of reorganization when it became effective. Accordingly, the ultimate amount of such claims is not determinable until such time as the Bankruptcy Court determines their allowed amount. Pre-petition liabilities that are subject to compromise are reported at the amounts management expects to become allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for different amounts upon confirmation. The amounts currently classified as Liabilities subject to compromise are preliminary and may be subject to future adjustments depending on Bankruptcy Court actions, further developments with respect to disputed claims, determinations of the secured status of certain claims, the values of any collateral securing such claims, rejection of executory contracts, continued reconciliation or other events.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
For a discussion of new accounting standards relevant to our business, refer to Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Emerging Growth Company
Prior to December 31, 2024, we qualified as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We were able to take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including not being required to have our internal control over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments. 
On the last business day of the second quarter in 2024, the aggregate market value of the Company’s shares of common stock held by non-affiliate stockholders exceeded $700 million. As a result, as of December 31, 2024, the Company qualified as a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, and ceased to be an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act.
The impact of this change in filing status includes being subject to the requirements of large accelerated filers, which includes shortened filing timelines, no delayed adoption of certain accounting standards, and attestation of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting by its independent auditor.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
The following discussion about our market risk exposures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. For more information regarding the forward-looking statements used in this section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see the section titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included at the forepart of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Foreign Currency and Exchange Risk
The vast majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars.
Risk Regarding the Price of Bitcoin
Our business and development strategy is focused on maintaining and expanding our bitcoin Mining operations to maximize the amount of new bitcoin rewards we earn. As of December 31, 2024, we held 255.9 bitcoin, with a carrying value of $23.9 million, all of which were produced from our bitcoin mining operations.
We cannot predict the future market price of bitcoin and, as such, we cannot predict future changes in the carrying value of our bitcoin assets based on future market prices. The future value of bitcoin will affect the amount of revenue recognized from our operations, and any changes in the future value of bitcoin while we hold it in our account would also be reported in our net income (or loss), either of which could have a material adverse effect on the market price for our securities.
71
Bitcoin prices for the year ended December 31, 2024 ranged from a low of $38,515 to a high of $108,253, with an average price of $65,894. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the price of bitcoin produced during the year ended December 31, 2024, would have increased or decreased net loss by approximately $40.9 million.
Commodity Price Risk 
Certain of our operating costs are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of the underlying commodity prices, including electricity used in our data center operations. The Company manages the commodity price risk by entering into derivative instruments to manage the variability in future cash flows from forecasted energy purchases. Management considers energy prices, weather forecasts, forecasted energy purchases, and other factors when determining the extent of its risk management strategy over commodity price risk. 
A hypothetical 10% change in commodity prices would have resulted in an immaterial change in the fair value of our commodity-based derivatives as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID

)
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
Core Scientific, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Core Scientific, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in contingently redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes

(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  In our opinion, based on our audits, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013 and our report, dated February 26, 2025
, 
expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Digital Asset Self-Mining Revenue 
We identified the accounting for revenue recognition from Digital Asset Self-Mining as a critical audit matter due to the complexities involved in auditing the completeness and occurrence of this revenue recognized by the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized revenue from Digital Asset Self-Mining of approximately $408.7 million. The Company’s management has exercised significant judgment in their determination of how existing accounting principles generally accepted in the United States should be applied to the accounting for revenue recognized from Digital Asset Self-Mining. In addition, the accounting for Digital Asset Self-Mining revenue recognized involved certain systems and applications subject to the general controls over the information technology (“IT”) environment of the Company.
74
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:
•
Evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of IT general controls over the Company’s IT environment and key financially relevant systems;
•
Evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the financial controls pertaining to the Company’s processes for recognizing revenue from Digital Assets Self-Mining;
•
Performed site visitations of the facilities where the Company’s mining hardware is located, which included an observation of the physical and environmental controls and mining equipment inventory observation procedures;
•
On a sample basis, tested the hashing power contributed by the Company’s mining hardware;
•
Evaluated management’s rationale for the application of Accounting Standards Codification 606 to account for its digital assets earned, which included evaluating the provisions of the contract between the Company and the Mining Pool Operators;
•

•
Evaluated and tested management’s rationale and supporting documentation associated with the valuation of Bitcoin earned;
•
Independently confirmed certain financial and performance data directly with the Mining Pool Operators;
•
Independently confirmed certain financial data directly with the Company’s third-party wallet custodian;
•
Compared the Company’s digital wallet and custody records to publicly available blockchain records; and
•
Performed certain substantive analytical procedures to determine completeness and occurrence of digital assets earned by the Company as consideration for services rendered.

Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.         ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Core Scientific, Inc. (“Core Scientific” or the “Company”) is a leader in digital infrastructure for bitcoin mining and high-performance computing. We operate dedicated, purpose-built facilities for digital asset mining and are a premier provider of digital infrastructure, software solutions and services to our third-party customers. We employ our own large fleet of computers (“miners”) to earn digital assets for our own account and we provide hosting services for large bitcoin mining customers and are in the process of allocating and converting a significant portion of our 
ten
 data centers in 
Alabama (
1
), 
Georgia (
2
), Kentucky (
1
), North Carolina (
1
), North Dakota (
1
), Oklahoma (
1
), and Texas (
3
) to support artificial intelligence-related workloads under a series of contracts that entail the modification of certain of our data centers to deliver hosting services for high-performance computing (“HPC”). We derive the majority of our revenue from earning bitcoin for our own account (“self-mining”).
The Company has historically focused on designing, developing and operating digital infrastructure to engage in digital asset mining for its own account and providing hosting solutions for third-party digital asset miners. Beginning on March 6, 2024, we announced a series of new contractual agreements with a third-party provider of HPC operations for customers using specialized graphics processing units (“GPUs”). These new agreements leverage the Company’s existing digital infrastructure and expertise in third-party hosting solutions. 
We currently operate in 
three
 segments: “Digital Asset Self-Mining,” consisting of digital asset mining for our own account, “Digital Asset Hosted Mining,” consisting of our digital infrastructure and third-party hosting services for digital asset mining, and “HPC Hosting,” consisting of our digital infrastructure and third-party hosting services for client HPC operations. Prior to April 1, 2024, we operated only in the Digital Asset Self-Mining and Digital Asset Hosted Mining segments.
Our digital asset hosted mining business provides a full suite of services to our digital asset mining customers. We provide deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting, optimization and maintenance of our customers’ digital asset mining equipment and provide necessary electrical power, repair and other infrastructure services necessary for our customers to operate, maintain and efficiently mine digital assets.
Our HPC hosting services provide colocation, facilities operations, security and other services to third-party HPC customers to support workloads for machine learning and artificial intelligence. The extension of our business into the HPC Hosting segment involves significant risk, including risks involving facility construction, supply chain and the risk of nonperformance by our single customer, as disclosed further in Part I, Item 1A. — “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Chapter 11 Filing and Emergence from Bankruptcy
On December 21, 2022, the Company and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”) seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”). The Chapter 11 Cases were jointly administered under Case No. 22-90341. The Debtors continued to operate their business and manage their properties as “debtors-in-possession” (“DIP”) under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. For detailed discussion about the Chapter 11 Cases, refer to Note 3 — Chapter 11 Filing and Emergence from Bankruptcy.
On January 15, 2024, the Debtors filed the Fourth Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Core Scientific, Inc. and its Debtor Affiliates (with Technical Modifications) (the “Plan of Reorganization”) with the Bankruptcy Court. On January 16, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) among other things, confirming the Plan of Reorganization. On January 23, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), the conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan of Reorganization were satisfied or waived and the Company emerged from bankruptcy.
The Company was not required to apply fresh start accounting based on the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 852, 
Reorganizations
, since the entity’s reorganization value immediately before the date of confirmation was more than the total of all its post-petition liabilities and allowed claims.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
2.         SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described below and elsewhere in these notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Some of the more significant estimates include assumptions used in the valuation of the Company’s common shares and the determination of the grant date fair value of stock-based compensation awards for periods prior to the Business Combination (as defined in Note 4 — Business Combination and Restructuring), the valuation of digital assets, property, plant and equipment, the initial measurement of lease liabilities, stock-based compensation, the fair value of derivative liabilities, and income taxes. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; therefore, actual results could differ from management’s estimates.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $
836.2
 million, substantially all of which exceeded Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. Cash equivalents included $
832.2
 million of highly liquid money market funds, which are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Restricted cash consists of a deposit held at a lender’s bank in accordance with the terms of a note agreement.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company’s accounts receivable balance consists of amounts due from its hosting customers. The Company records accounts receivable at the invoiced amount less an allowance for any potentially uncollectible accounts under the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) impairment model and presents the net amount of the financial instrument expected to be collected. The CECL impairment model requires an estimate of expected credit losses, measured over the contractual life of an instrument, which considers forecasts of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions. Based on this model, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, collection history, and current economic trends. Bad debts are written off after all collection efforts have ceased.
Allowances for credit losses are recorded as a direct reduction from an asset’s amortized cost basis. Credit losses and recoveries are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Recoveries of financial assets previously written off are recorded when received. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not record any credit losses or recoveries.
The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts was 
nil
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Digital Assets
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-08, 
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets
 (“ASU 2023-08”). ASU 2023-08 is intended to improve the accounting for certain crypto assets by requiring an entity to measure those crypto assets at fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in net income (loss). The amendments also improve the information provided to investors about an entity’s crypto asset holdings by requiring disclosure about significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions, and changes during the reporting period. ASU 2023-08 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.
The Company’s digital assets are within the scope of ASU 2023-08 and the Company elected to early adopt the new standard prospectively effective January 1, 2024. The transition guidance requires a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the 
85
Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
current fiscal year for any difference between the carrying amount of the Company’s digital assets and fair value. The early adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  
As of August 19, 2024, the Company is no longer required to sell bitcoin it earns through mining within 
ten days
 of receipt as provided by the terms of the recently extinguished debt facilities (Exit Credit Agreement, the Secured Notes and the New Secured Convertible Notes). See Note 8 — Convertible and Other Notes Payable. The Company intends to optimize cash received from bitcoin mining which may entail, subject to market conditions, holding bitcoin for future sale at any particular point in time. Digital assets are classified as current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, reflecting management's current intent and expectation to convert these assets to cash within the next year. The classification of digital assets is evaluated regularly, and any change in management's intent or expectations regarding the timing of conversion to cash could result in a reclassification of these assets. Sales of digital assets awarded to the Company through its self-mining activities are classified as cash flows from operating activities if sold nearly immediately. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet holdings of digital assets and does not safeguard digital assets for third parties. The Company tracks its cost basis of digital assets in accordance with the first-in-first-out method of accounting.
The Company’s digital assets have active markets with observable prices and their fair value measurements are considered Level 1. The following table presents a roll-forward of total digital assets for the year ended December 31, 2024, (under the prospectively adopted ASU 2023-08 fair value model), and the year ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

Deposits for Equipment
The Company has entered into agreements with vendors to supply equipment for its digital asset mining operations. These agreements generally require significant refundable deposits payable months in advance of delivery and additional advance payments in monthly installments thereafter.
The Company classifies deposits for digital asset mining equipment based on the expected predominant source and use of the cash flows for the equipment that has been contracted for purchase. The Company expects that the predominant source and use of cash flows for digital asset mining equipment will be related to the Company’s own self-mining operations. Therefore, the Company has classified deposits for equipment as cash flows from investing activities.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Property, Plant and Equipment, Net
Property, plant, and equipment includes the cost of land, buildings, and improvements for datacenter and support facilities and the Company’s corporate office space. Property and equipment further consists of computer, mining, network, electrical and other equipment, including property and equipment under finance leases. Property, plant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term. Future obligations related to finance leases are presented as Finance lease liabilities, current portion and Finance lease liabilities, net of current portion in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Depreciation expense, including amortization of assets held under finance leases, is primarily included in Cost of revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Property, plant and equipment capitalized costs include the directly identifiable costs incurred to acquire, construct, install, or otherwise prepare the asset for its intended use and to put it into service. Directly identifiable costs include construction payroll and benefits, demolition necessary for construction to purpose, and other direct capital project costs. Intersegment transfers of property, plant, and equipment are recorded at their net carrying value with no resulting gain or loss.
Leases
The Company has entered into operating and finance leases for office space, data facilities, computer and networking equipment, electrical infrastructure and office equipment, with lease periods expiring through 2051.The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of the arrangement. If a lease is determined to exist, the term of such lease is assessed based on the commencement date on which the underlying asset is made available for the Company’s use by the lessor. The Company’s assessment of the lease term reflects the non-cancelable term of the lease, inclusive of any rent-free periods and periods covered by early-termination options which the Company is reasonably certain of not exercising, as well as periods covered by renewal options which the Company is reasonably certain of exercising. The Company also determines lease classification as either operating or finance at lease commencement, which governs the pattern of expense recognition and presentation over the lease term.
For leases with a term exceeding 12 months, a lease liability is recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at lease commencement, reflecting the present value of its fixed payment obligations over the lease term. A corresponding right-of-use asset equal to the initial lease liability is also recognized, adjusted for any prepaid rent and initial direct costs incurred in connection with the execution of the lease and reduced by any lease incentives received. For purposes of measuring the present value of its fixed payment obligations for a given lease, the Company uses rates implicit in its leasing arrangements, if readily determinable, otherwise the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate it would pay to borrow on a similarly secured basis and term, the economic environment of the associated lease, and other information available to management.
For leases with a term of 12 months or less, at commencement, and that do not include an option to purchase the underlying assets, the Company has elected the exemption to not measure and recognize an associated lease liability or right-of-use asset.
For the Company’s operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease costs are recognized as the obligation for payment is incurred and primarily consist of insurance and property tax reimbursements to the lessor.
The Company addresses lease modifications that are not accounted for as separate leases at the effective date of the modification. If the terms and conditions of the lease are changed, the lease payments are adjusted accordingly and the lease liability is remeasured using a revised discount rate. Any resulting changes in the lease liability are recognized in the carrying amount of the related right-of-use asset.
Long-Lived Asset Impairments
The Company tests long-lived asset groups for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may affect the recoverability or the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets. Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization. A long-lived asset may be impaired when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. If that comparison indicates that the asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable, the 
87
Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell.

Deferred Revenue
The Company records contract liabilities in Deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets when cash payments are received in advance of performance and recognizes them as revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. The Company’s total deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was $
18.1
 million and $
9.8
 million, respectively.
In the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $
6.7
 million of revenue, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of the beginning of the year. 
In the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $
21.0
 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of the beginning of the year. 
Advanced payments are typically recognized in the following month for hosted mining services and are generally recognized within 
30
 months of license order commencement for HPC hosting services.
Convertible and Other Notes Payable
Convertible and other notes payable (“Notes payable”) are accounted for under ASC 470, 
Debt 
(“ASC 470”) and are presented at their carrying value, which is their remaining par or face amount net of any related unamortized premium, discount and issuance costs. Notes payable are initially recognized at their present value. When cash proceeds are received for the issuance of Notes payable, the proceeds are used to establish their present value. When cash proceeds are not received for the issuance of Notes payable, their present value is based on the consideration exchanged. This present value generally will be the Notes payable’s cash flows discounted at a market rate when it is more evident than the noncash consideration exchanged. When the present value of Notes payable on issuance varies from its par or face amount, an original discount or premium results and any related issuance costs are used to determine an effective interest rate. Original premium, discount and issuance costs are amortized using the level effective rate interest method. Amortization is recognized as a component of current interest expense.
Notes payable are evaluated at issuance to determine whether or not they have features or terms which would be treated as embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging 
(“ASC 815”). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Notes payable did not have any embedded derivatives required to be bifurcated.
Debt Issuance Costs
Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the associated debt. Debt issuance costs are presented in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability consistent with the debt discount.
Contingent Value Rights Liabilities
As described in Note 9 — Contingent Value Rights and Warrant Liabilities, on the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the Company entered into a contingent value rights agreement (the “Contingent Value Rights Agreement”) which  provides for the issuance of the contingent value rights (the “CVRs”) to certain creditors and provides for the issuance of CVRs issued to holders of allowed general unsecured claims (“GUC”) (in such capacity, the “GUC Payees”) (the “GUC CVRs”). The CVRs and GUC CVRs are equity-linked instruments which are either only cash settled or in some instances share settled at the Company’s sole discretion. The Company determined that these equity-linked instruments are not indexed to the Company’s stock and are required to be recognized as liabilities which are, initially and subsequently, measured at fair value with changes in value reflected in Net loss.
Warrant Liabilities
The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be classified as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.
88
Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Prior to the Effective Date, the Company had public warrants and private placement warrants that were recognized as derivative liabilities. Accordingly, the Company recognized the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusted the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities were subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date, and any change in fair value was recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and presented as Change in fair value of warrants and contingent value rights. The initial and subsequent estimated fair value of both the public warrants and private placement warrants was based on the listed price in an active market for the public warrants.
As described in Note 9 — Contingent Value Rights and Warrant Liabilities, on the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, holders of the Company’s previous common stock received warrants. The warrants are equity-linked instruments. The Company determined that these equity-linked instruments are not indexed to the Company’s stock and are required to be recognized as liabilities which are, initially and subsequently, measured at fair value with changes in value reflected in Net income (loss).
Revenue From Contracts With Customers - Digital Asset Self-Mining Revenue
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, 
Revenue Recognition 
(“ASC 606”).

One of the Company’s ongoing major or central operations is to provide a service of performing hash calculations to third-party pool operators alongside collectives of third-party bitcoin miners (such collectives, “mining pools”) as a participant. The Company considers the third-party mining pool operators to be its customers under Topic 606. Contract inception and our enforceable right to consideration begins when we commence providing hash calculation services to the mining pool operators. Each party to the contract has the unilateral right to terminate the contract at any time without any compensation to the other party for such termination. As such, the duration of a contract is less than a day and may be continuously renewed multiple times throughout the day. The implied renewal option is not a material right because there are no upfront or incremental fees in the initial contract and the terms, conditions, and compensation amount for the renewal options are at the then market rates.
The Company is entitled to non-cash compensation based on the Full-Pay-Per-Share (“FPPS”) model of the mining pool it is a participant in. FPPS pools pay block rewards and transaction fees, less mining pool fees and the participants are entitled to non-cash consideration even if a block is not successfully validated by the mining pool operator. The Company is entitled to compensation once it begins to perform hash calculations for the pool operator in accordance with the operator’s specifications over a 24-hour period beginning mid-night UTC and ending 23:59:59 UTC on a daily basis. The non-cash consideration that we are entitled to for providing hash calculations to the pool operator under the FPPS payout method is made up of block rewards and transaction fees less pool operator expenses determined as follows:
•
The non-cash consideration in the form of a block reward is based on the total blocks expected to be generated on the Bitcoin Network for the daily 24-hour period beginning midnight UTC and ending 23:59:59 UTC in accordance with the following formula: the daily hash calculations that we provided to the pool operator as a percent of the Bitcoin Network’s implied hash calculations as determined by the network difficulty, multiplied by the total Bitcoin Network block rewards expected to be generated for the same daily period.
•
The non-cash consideration in the form of transaction fees paid by transaction requestors is based on the share of total actual fees paid over the daily 24-hour period beginning midnight UTC and ending 23:59:59 UTC in accordance with the following formula: total actual transaction fees generated on the Bitcoin Network during the 24-hour period as a percent of total block rewards the Bitcoin Network actually generated during the same 24-hour period, multiplied by the block rewards we earned for the same 24-hour period noted above.
•
The block reward and transaction fees earned by the Company is reduced by mining pool fees charged by the operator for operating the pool based on a rate schedule per the mining pool contract. The mining pool fee is only incurred to the extent we perform hash calculations and generate revenue in accordance with the pool operator’s payout formula during the same 24-hour period beginning mid-night UTC daily.
The above non-cash consideration is variable, since the amount of block reward earned depends on the amount of hash calculations we perform; the amount of transaction fees we are entitled to depends on the actual Bitcoin Network transaction fees over the same 24-hour period; and the operator fees for the same 24-hour period are variable since it is determined based on the total block rewards and transaction fees in accordance with the pool operator’s agreement. While the non-cash consideration is variable, the Company has the ability to estimate the variable consideration at contract inception with reasonable certainty without the risk of significant revenue reversal. The Company does not constrain this variable consideration because it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized from the contract will not occur when the uncertainty is subsequently resolved and recognizes the non-cash consideration on the same day that control is transferred, which is the same day as contract inception.
89
Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company measures the non-cash consideration using the spot rate for Bitcoin as quoted on Coinbase Global, Inc., the Company’s principal market. The Company recognizes non-cash consideration on the same day that control of the contracted service is transferred to the pool operator, which is the same day as the contract inception.
Direct expenses associated with providing hash calculation services to a third-party operated mining pool are recorded as cost of revenues. Depreciation and amortization expenses on fixed and right-of-use assets, including digital asset mining equipment, used to provide the services are also recorded as a component of cost of revenues. 
Revenue From Contracts With Customers - Digital Asset Hosted Mining Services
The Company generates revenue from contracts with customers from digital asset hosted mining services. Prior to fiscal 2023, 
the “
Digital Asset Hosted Mining
” segment also included 
sales of mining equipment to customers and was referred to as “Hosting and Equipment Sales”, when the Company also recognized revenue from contracts with customers from sales of computer equipment, in which the Company generally recognized revenue when control of the promised equipment was transferred to customers. The Company generally recognizes revenue when the promised service is performed. Revenue excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. 
Hosting Services 
The Company regularly enters contracts that include hosting services, for which revenue is recognized as services are performed on a variable basis. The Company performs hosting services that enable customers to run blockchain and other high-performance computing operations. The Company’s performance obligation related to these services is satisfied over time. The Company recognizes revenue for services that are performed on a consumption basis, such as the amount of electricity used in a period, based on the customer’s use of such resources. The Company recognizes variable consumption usage hosting revenue each month as the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved, hosting services are provided to our customers, and our customers utilize the hosting services (the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance). The Company generally bills its customers in advance based on estimated consumption under the contract. The Company recognizes revenue based on actual consumption in the period and invoices adjustments in subsequent periods or retains credits toward future consumption. The term between invoicing and when payment is due typically does not exceed 
30
 days. 
Equipment Sales (Applicable to year ended December 31, 2022)
The Company entered into contracts with more than one performance obligation. For example, the Company entered into contracts that include both hosting services and sales of computer equipment to those same customers, for which revenue was recognized at the point in time when control of the equipment was transferred to the customer (typically at the start of the contract period). For these contracts, revenue was recognized based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation in the contract. 
The Company recognized revenue from sales of computer equipment to customers at the point in time when control of the equipment is transferred to the customer, which generally occurred upon deployment of the equipment. Customers made a series of deposits on equipment purchases with the final payment typically being due at least 
one month
 prior to deployment. Self-mining computer equipment that was subsequently sold to customers was recognized as Equipment Sales to Customers in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. We do not expect to enter equipment sales contracts in the future or to have any equipment sales revenue after December 31, 2022.

Revenue Recognition - HPC Hosting Revenue
Our HPC hosting segment generates revenue by licensing data center space to our customer under licensing agreements. These arrangements contain lease components for the right to use data center space and nonlease components for power delivery, physical security, and maintenance services. We have elected the practical expedient available under ASC Topic 842, 
Leases
, to combine the nonlease revenue components that have the same pattern of transfer as the related operating lease components into a single combined component. The single combined component is accounted for under ASC Topic 842 as an operating lease if the lease components are the predominant components and is accounted for under ASC Topic 606 if the nonlease components are the predominant components. The lease components are the predominant components in our current licensing arrangements and the single combined component in these arrangements are accounted for under the operating lease guidance of ASC Topic 842.
We have concluded that it is probable that substantially all of the payments will be collected over the term of the arrangements and recognize the total combined component license payments under the agreements on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term. Straight-line license revenue represents the difference in revenue recognized during the period and the license payments due pursuant to the underlying arrangement as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Certain arrangements include options to extend the term. These extension options are not reasonably certain to be exercised and are excluded from the lease term and calculation of lease payments at lease commencement.
Certain licensing arrangements provide for variable payments for power delivery services and maintenance services on customer assets and reimbursements for lessor costs such as taxes. Payments for physical security and other routine maintenance services are included in the fixed lease payments. Power delivery services represent a stand ready obligation to make power available to the customer over the coterminous lease term and have the same pattern of transfer as the related operating lease components. Customers may request and the Company may provide maintenance services on customer assets during the coterminous lease term. Customers are charged monthly for fees incurred on these maintenance services delivered and actual power costs incurred at current utility or fuel cost rates. These payments from customers for power delivery and maintenance services are recognized as variable lease payments in accordance with the practical expedient elected. Variable lease payments are presented on a gross basis and are included in 
HPC hosting revenue
 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Performance Obligation Commitments
The Company’s performance obligation commitments relate to digital asset hosted mining services. The Company has performance obligations associated with commitments in customer digital asset hosted mining contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2024, for contracts with original terms that exceed one year (typically ranging from 
15
 to 
24
 months), we expect to recognize approximately $
8.4
 million of revenue in the future related to performance obligations associated with existing hosted mining contracts. The Company expects to recognize approximately 
100
% of this amount over the next 
12
 months.
Costs of Revenue
The Company’s Cost of Digital Asset Self-Mining, Cost of Digital Asset Hosted Mining Services, and Cost of HPC Hosting Services primarily consist of p
ower fees, depreciation expense, facility operations expense and employee compensation, including stock-based compensation
. Cost of Equipment Sales represented costs of computer equipment sold to customers.
Stock-Based Compensation
Under ASC 718, 
Stock Compensation
 (“ASC 718”) estimated fair value uses a fair-value-based method. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the equity award. The estimated fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with only service conditions is based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The estimated fair value of market condition restricted stock units (“MSUs”) is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte-Carlo pricing model for each service and market condition tranche. 
For RSU awards with only service conditions, the estimated fair value of the equity awards is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis, less actual forfeitures as they occur, over the requisite service period for the entire award, which is generally the vesting period. For RSU awards with service and market conditions, the compensation expense is recognized for each separately vesting portion of the award, or tranche, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting and exercise conditions (i.e., on an accelerated attribution basis). The estimated fair value of each tranche is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis, less actual forfeitures as they occur, over the requisite service for the tranche. The requisite service period of each tranche is the greater of the 
91
Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
derived service period from the market condition or the service condition vesting period.
 See Note 12 — Stockholders' Deficit for more information about the service and market conditions associated with the Company’s equity awards.
Research and Development
The Company’s research and development expenses primarily include personnel costs associated with technology and product development and data science research. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes
The Company is subject to income taxes mainly in the jurisdictions in which it provides various infrastructure, technology and hosting services. The Company’s tax position requires significant judgment in order to properly evaluate and quantify tax positions and to determine the provision for income taxes.
The Company uses the assets and liabilities method to account for income taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities be determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to be reversed. The Company estimates its actual current tax expense, including permanent charges and benefits, and the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, for tax and financial accounting purposes.
The Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized by considering both positive and negative evidence. If the Company believes that recovery of these deferred tax assets is not more likely than not, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considered all available evidence, including recent operating results, projections of future taxable income, the reversal of taxable temporary differences, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.
GAAP sets forth a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included within Income Tax Expense. Accrued interest and penalties are included in the related tax liability line in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The Company adjusts its reserves for tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the refinement of an estimate based on new facts or changes in tax laws. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, the differences are recorded as adjustments to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision (benefit) for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
The Company’s future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof. In addition, the Company is subject to examination of income tax returns by various tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provisions for income taxes.

3.         CHAPTER 11 FILING AND EMERGENCE FROM BANKRUPTCY
Chapter 11
On December 21, 2022 (the “Petition Date”), the Debtors filed the Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Chapter 11 Cases are jointly administered under Case No. 22-90341. The Debtors continued to operate their business and managed their properties as DIP under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.
On June 20, 2023, the Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court (i) a proposed Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Core Scientific, Inc. and its Debtor Affiliates and a related proposed form of Disclosure Statement, and on January 15, 2024, the Debtors filed the Fourth Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Core Scientific, Inc. and its Affiliated Debtors (with Technical Modifications) with the Bankruptcy Court. 
On September 19, 2023, the Debtors, the ad hoc group of the Debtors’ secured convertible notes holders (the “Ad Hoc Noteholder Group”) and the equity committee (the “Equity Committee”) reached an agreement in principle with respect to the economic terms of the Plan of Reorganization (the “Mediated Settlement”). The Debtors, the Ad Hoc Noteholder Group and the Equity Committee continued to work and negotiate in good faith to document the Mediated Settlement, resolve certain open issues and culminating in the Plan of Reorganization.
On January 16, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order among other things, confirming the Plan of Reorganization. On January 23, 2024, (the “Effective Date”), the conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan of Reorganization were satisfied or waived and the Company emerged from bankruptcy.

Original DIP Credit Agreement and Restructuring Support Agreement
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors entered into a senior secured super-priority debtor-in-possession loan and security agreement, dated as of December 22, 2022 (the “Original DIP Credit Agreement”), with Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent, and the lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the “Original DIP Lenders”). The Original DIP Lenders are also holders or affiliates, partners or investors of holders under the Company’s notes sold pursuant to (i) the Secured Convertible Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 19, 2021 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time), by and among Core Scientific, Inc. (as successor of Core Scientific Holding Co.), the guarantors party thereto from time to time, U.S. Bank National Association, as note agent and collateral agent, and the purchasers of the notes issued thereunder (the “Secured Convertible Notes”), and (ii) the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 20, 2021 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time), by and among Core Scientific, Inc. (as successor of Core Scientific Holding Co.), the guarantors party thereto from time to time, U.S. Bank National Association, as note agent and collateral agent, and the purchasers of the notes issued thereunder (the “Other Convertible Notes,” and together with the Secured Convertible Notes, the “Convertible Notes”).
Also in connection with the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company entered into a restructuring support agreement (together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the “Restructuring Support Agreement”) with the ad hoc group of noteholders, representing more than 
70
% of the Ad Hoc Noteholder Group pursuant to which the Ad Hoc Noteholder Group agreed to provide commitments for a debtor-in-possession facility (the “Original DIP Facility”) of more than $
57
 million and agreed to support the syndication of up to an additional $
18
 million in new money debtor-in-possession facility loans to all holders of Convertible Notes. The Company terminated the Restructuring Support Agreement pursuant to a “fiduciary out” which permitted the Company to pursue better alternatives. 
Replacement DIP Credit Agreement
On February 2, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an interim order authorizing, among other things, the Debtors to obtain senior secured non-priming super-priority replacement post-petition financing (the “Replacement DIP Facility”). On February 27, 2023, the Debtors entered into a senior secured super-priority replacement debtor-in-possession loan and security agreement governing the Replacement DIP Facility (the “Replacement DIP Credit Agreement”), with B. Riley Commercial Capital, LLC, as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), and the lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the “Replacement DIP Lender”). Proceeds of the Replacement DIP Facility were used to, among other things, repay amounts outstanding under the original debtor-in-possession facility that was entered into in connection with the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases (the “Original DIP Facility”), including payment of all fees and expenses required to be paid under the terms of the Original DIP Facility. These funds, along with ongoing cash generated from operations, were anticipated to provide the necessary financing to effectuate the planned restructuring, facilitate the emergence from Chapter 11, and cover the fees and expenses of legal and financial advisors.
On March 1, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Replacement DIP Facility on a final basis and the terms under which the Debtors are authorized to use the cash collateral of the holders of their convertible notes (the “Final DIP Order”).
On July 4, 2023, the Debtors, the Administrative Agents and the Replacement DIP Lender entered into the First Amendment to the Replacement DIP Credit Agreement.
In January 2024, the Replacement DIP Facility was repaid in full and terminated on the Effective Date of the Company’s Plan of Reorganization.
Federal Income Tax Consequences
As of December 31, 2023, the Tax Group had net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $
330.2
 million (all of which are post-2017 NOLs that are subject to an 80% taxable income limitation) and certain other tax attributes before taking into account the implementation of the Plan of Reorganization. An ownership change is not expected with the implementation of the Plan of Reorganization which would, if it occurred, limit our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards under Sec. 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Tax Code”). However, certain future equity trading activity and other actions could result in an ownership change of the Tax Group independent of the Plan of Reorganization, which could adversely affect the ability of the Debtors to utilize their tax 
94

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
attributes. In addition, as discussed below, in connection with and as a result of the implementation of the Plan of Reorganization, the amount of the Tax Group’s NOL carryforwards, and possibly certain other tax attributes, may be reduced.
In general, the Tax Code provides that a debtor in a bankruptcy case must reduce certain of its tax attributes - such as NOL carryforwards and current year NOLs, capital loss carryforwards, tax credits, and tax basis in assets - by the amount of any cancellation of debt (“COD”) incurred pursuant to a confirmed chapter 11 plan. Based on the Plan of Reorganization, the Tax Group is expected to incur COD income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the implementation of the Plan of Reorganization and, thus, expect that the Tax Group’s NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes will be reduced as a result of any COD incurred.
Sec. 163(l) generally disallows a corporate issuer's interest deductions with respect to debt instruments payable in equity of the issuer or a related party. A debt instrument is considered “payable in equity” if by the terms of the instrument, or at the option of an issuer or related party, a substantial amount of the principal or interest is (1) required to be paid in or converted into equity, or (2) determined by reference to the value of equity. In addition, debt is considered payable in equity if the overall arrangement is such that it is “reasonably expected” that the issuer will pay in or by reference to equity, even if the issuer's payment in or by reference to equity is conditioned on events outside the issuer's control. Pursuant to the current terms of certain new debts, the Debtors may pay a portion of the interest in stock and, under certain circumstances, require the conversion of such notes into stock. In addition, a holder of the respective debts may at its option convert the notes into stock. The proper application of Sec. 163(l) in the case of the new debts is subject to varying interpretations. However, based on the current terms of the new debts, the Debtors expect disallowance of deductibility of certain interest with respect to the new debts under Sec. 163(l).
Settlements
NYDIG Settlement
On February 26, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “NYDIG Order”), whereby the Debtors and NYDIG agreed that the Debtors would transfer the miners serving as collateral under the NYDIG Loan back to NYDIG over a period of several months in exchange for the full extinguishment of the NYDIG Loan. The final shipment of miners serving as collateral under the NYDIG loan occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, after which the NYDIG Loan was extinguished in full and the Company recorded a $

Priority Power was determined to have a single aggregate allowed claim of $
20.8
 million, which was secured by a perfected mechanic’s lien.

Reorganization items, net and Liabilities Subject to Compromise 
Effective on December 21, 2022, the Company began to apply the provisions of ASC 852, 
Reorganizations
 (“ASC 852”), which is applicable to companies under bankruptcy protection, and requires amendments to the presentation of certain financial statement line items. ASC 852 requires that the financial statements for periods including and after the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses, and provisions for losses that can be directly associated with the reorganization must be reported separately as Reorganization items, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations beginning December 21, 2022, the date of filing of the Chapter 11 Cases. As of December 31, 2023, liabilities that were affected by the Plan of Reorganization were classified as liabilities subject to compromise at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may have been settled for lesser amounts as a result of the Plan of Reorganization or negotiations with creditors. If there was uncertainty about whether a secured claim was under secured, or would be impaired under the Plan of Reorganization, the entire amount of the claim was included with prepetition claims in liabilities subject to compromise. After the Effective Date, any resulting changes in classification were reflected in subsequent financial statements.
97
Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
As a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases on December 21, 2022, the classification of pre-petition indebtedness was generally subject to compromise pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization. Generally, actions to enforce or otherwise effect payment of pre-bankruptcy filing liabilities were stayed. The Bankruptcy Court granted the Debtors authority to pay certain pre-petition claims in designated categories and subject to certain terms and conditions. This relief generally was designed to preserve the value of the Debtors’ businesses and assets. Among other things, the Bankruptcy Court authorized the Debtors to pay certain pre-petition claims relating to employee wages and benefits, taxes and critical vendors. The Debtors paid undisputed post-petition liabilities in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Debtors rejected certain pre-petition executory contracts and unexpired leases with respect to their operations with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Any damages resulting from the rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases were treated as general unsecured claims and paid in full.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, there were significant reorganization related gains resulting primarily from satisfaction of allowed claims under the Plan of Reorganization on the Effective Date and negotiated settlements, partially offset by professional fees and other bankruptcy related costs. These reorganization related impacts were classified as Reorganization items, net until the Effective Date. Reorganization costs incurred after the Effective Date have been classified as General and administrative expense.
The accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023, includes amounts classified as Liabilities subject to compromise, which represented liabilities the Company estimated would be allowed as claims in the Chapter 11 Cases by the Court. These amounts represented the Company's estimate of known or potential obligations to be resolved in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, improvements in the Company’s condition and other developments indicated that secured claims which were initially considered subject to compromise at the beginning of the bankruptcy process and at December 31, 2022, were determined to no longer be subject to compromise as of December 31, 2023.
Final determination of the value at which liabilities were settled was made when the Plan of Reorganization became effective and the Company emerged from bankruptcy.

Pursuant to the terms of (a) the Merger Agreement and (b) that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 1, 2021, as amended on January 14, 2022, by and among XPDI, Core Scientific Holding Co., XPDI Merger Sub 3, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of XPDI (“Merger Sub 3”), and Blockcap, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Core Scientific (“Blockcap”), the Business Combination was effected by (i) the merger of Merger Sub with and into Core Scientific (the “First Merger”), which occurred on January 19, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), with Core Scientific surviving the First Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of XPDI, (ii) the merger of Core Scientific with and into XPDI (the “Second Merger”), which occurred on January 20, 2022, with XPDI surviving the Second Merger, and (iii) following the closing of the Second Merger on January 20, 2022, the merger of Blockcap with and into Merger Sub 3 (the “Third Merger”), with Merger Sub 3 surviving the Third Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of XPDI under the name “Core Scientific Acquired Mining LLC.” Immediately prior to the effective time of the First Merger (such effective time of the First Merger, the “Effective Time”), XPDI filed a Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Post-Combination Charter”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to which XPDI changed its name from “Power & Digital Infrastructure Acquisition Corp.” to “Core Scientific, Inc.” (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) and redesignated its Class A common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share (“XPDI Class A Common Stock”), and Class B common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share (“XPDI Class B Common Stock”), as common stock, par value $
0.0001
, of the Company (“New Core Common Stock”). The Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement) was 
1.60015286880
 of a share of New Core Common Stock per fully-diluted share of Legacy Core.
In connection with the Special Meeting and the Business Combination, holders of 
12.3
 million of the 
34.5
 million then-outstanding shares of XPDI Class A Common Stock exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $
10.00
 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of $
123.5
 million.
100
Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Business Combination provided gross proceeds of approximately $
221.6
 million from the XPDI trust account, resulting in approximately $
201.0
 million in net cash proceeds to Core Scientific, after the payment of transaction expenses, which is presented within proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of transaction costs on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Following the Business Combination, Legacy Core stockholders owned 
90.7
%, former XPDI public stockholders owned 
6.7
% and XPDI’s sponsor owned 
2.6
% of the issued and outstanding shares of New Core Common Stock, excluding the impact of unvested restricted stock units and options. The proceeds from the Business Combination were used to fund mining equipment purchases and infrastructure build-out.
The Business Combination is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization with the Company being the accounting acquirer. A reverse recapitalization does not result in a new basis of accounting. Accordingly, the reverse recapitalization was treated as the equivalent of Core Scientific Holding Co. issuing stock for the net assets of XPDI, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of XPDI are stated at historical costs, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The Company identified $
18.6
 million of direct and incremental transaction costs, which consist of legal, accounting, and other professional services directly related to the Business Combination, of which $
7.9
 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022. These transaction costs have been allocated to all instruments assumed or issued in the Business Combination on a relative fair value basis as of the date of the Business Combination. Transaction costs of $
16.6
 million have been allocated to equity-classified instruments and recognized as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital within total stockholders’ (deficit) equity. The cash outflows related to these costs have been netted against the proceeds from the issuance of New Core Common Stock upon the Business Combination with XPDI within financing activities on the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows. Transaction costs of $
2.0
 million have been allocated to liability-classified instruments that are measured at fair value through earnings and have been recognized as a charge within general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $
0.0001
, of Legacy Core automatically converted into 
one
 share of New Core Common Stock, and each share of Series B convertible preferred stock, par value $
0.0001
, of Legacy Core automatically converted into 
one
 share of New Core Common Stock.
In addition, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of XPDI Class B Common Stock automatically converted into 
one
 share of New Core Common Stock. 
1.7
 million shares (“SPAC Vesting Shares”) are subject to vesting conditions, and will vest i) upon the date on which New Core Common Stock’s volume-weighted average price is greater than $
12.50
 per share for any 
20
 trading days within any 
30
 consecutive trading day period within 
five years
 of the Closing Date or ii) upon any change in control of the Company, or a sale of substantially all of the Company’s assets that results in a change of control that is consummated within 
five years
 of the Closing Date that results in a price per share paid to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock equal to or in excess of $
12.50
 per share.
As a result of the Business Combination, all of XPDI’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock automatically converted into shares of New Core Common Stock on a 
one
-for-one basis. XPDI’s 
8.6
 million public warrants issued in its initial public offering (the “Public Warrants”) and 
6.3
 million warrants issued in connection with private placement at the time of XPDI’s initial public offering (the “Private Placement Warrants”) became warrants for New Core Common Stock.
All share-based compensation awards were converted into comparable equity awards that are settled or exercisable for shares of New Core Common Stock. As a result, each stock option and warrant was converted into an option or warrant to purchase shares of New Core Common Stock based on an exchange ratio of 
1.60015286880
. Each award of the Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) was converted into RSUs of New Core based on an exchange ratio of 
1.60015286880
.
Each convertible note was convertible into New Core Common Stock in accordance with the terms of such convertible promissory note; provided, however, that with respect to outstanding convertible promissory notes for which Core Scientific received a duly executed exercise of conversion in accordance with such convertible promissory note, exercising the right of such holder to convert such convertible promissory note subject to and conditioned upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, the outstanding principal amount and accrued interest as of the Effective Time with respect to such convertible promissory note was converted into shares of New Core Common Stock, equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of Core Scientific Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such convertible promissory note in accordance with such convertible promissory note immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio.
Restructuring Activities
During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, market conditions led management to evaluate its operations and refocus its efforts and resources on the core activities of its hosting and mining segments. Management initiated a plan to exit certain activities, 
101
Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
technologies and ancillary businesses, and to reduce portions of the Company’s workforce including those acquired through Blockcap’s acquisition of RADAR. Management completed the restructuring plan in October 2022 and all expected costs of the restructuring plan were recognized as of December 31, 2022.
Cash severance and related payments under the Company’s ongoing severance policy of $
0.9
 million were paid as compensation for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition to the cash restructuring charges, $
1.0
 million of stock-based compensation was paid in severance during the year ended December 31, 2022. Total cash and stock-based restructuring charges of $
2.3
 million were recognized in 
general and administrative expenses
 for the year ended December 31, 2022.
As a result of exiting Blockchain Technologies during the second quarter of 2022, $
2.0
 million of intangible assets ceased to be used. Additionally, the Company determined that $
2.5
 million of software intangible assets that were previously acquired from Stax Digital LLC would no longer be used as a result of current and planned software upgrades. Consequently, the Company recorded an impairment of other intangible assets of $
4.5
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is presented within 
impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
 on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Goodwill associated with these activities was included in the goodwill impairment charge of $
1.05
 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, of which $
996.5
 million was related to the Digital Asset Self-Mining reporting unit and $
58.2

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s operating performance and liquidity continued to be severely impacted by the prolonged decrease in the price of bitcoin, the increase in electricity costs, the increase in the global Bitcoin network hash rate and an increase in additional operating costs related to these factors. Additionally, primary and secondary market prices for application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) miners of the type used by the Company in its business operations had decreased significantly from previous levels.
During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company evaluated whether the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the operation of its data center facilities would recover the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment located at the sites and used in site operations, including the Company’s deployed mining equipment. Based on this evaluation, the Company determined 
102
Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
that the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment at the Cedarvale, Texas facility site may no longer be fully recoverable by the cash flows of the site. The Company measured the amount of impairment at the Cedarvale facility site as the difference between the carrying amount of the site asset group of $
119.8
 million and the estimated fair value of the site asset group of $
60.5
 million, resulting in an impairment of the facility site’s property, plant and equipment of $
59.3
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company evaluated whether the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from its operations would recover the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment asset groups located at the sites and used in site operations, including the Company’s deployed mining equipment. Based on this evaluation, the Company determined that the carrying value of its entire fleet of mining equipment and the other property, plant and equipment at the Cedarvale and Cottonwood, Texas facility sites may no longer be fully recoverable by the cash flows of those asset groups. The Company measured the amount of impairment of its fleet of mining equipment as the difference between their carrying amount of $
668.5
 million and their estimated fair value of $
176.3
 million resulting in an impairment of the fleet of mining equipment of $
492.2
 million. The Company measured the amount of impairment of its other property, plant and equipment at the Cedarvale and Cottonwood, Texas facility sites as the difference between their carrying amount of $
174.3
 million and their estimated fair value of $
135.1
 million resulting in an impairment of the other site property, plant and equipment of $
39.2
 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized impairments to property, plant and equipment of $
590.7
 million.
The Company’s analysis involved the use of a combination and corroboration of cost and market approaches. The cost approach has been used to estimate the fair value of some buildings, improvements, electrical equipment and other tangible assets used in combination with other assets. The cost approach was also used to corroborate certain estimates made using the market approach. Significant assumptions used in the cost approach include reproduction and replacement costs, useful service life, and orderly liquidation values. The cost approach utilizes useful service life and other estimates developed by the Company to determine fair value, which are unobservable Level 3 inputs. The market approach has been used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s ASIC miners, network equipment, real estate, and other of its buildings, improvements, electrical equipment and other tangible assets. The market approach was also used to corroborate certain estimates made using the cost approach. Valuations using the market approach are derived from manufacturer and secondary market pricing sources and, when available, comparable secondary market transactions. Significant judgment in using the market approach includes the selection of comparable assets based on the most relevant attributes of the evaluated asset, a selection of and modifications to transactions according to comparable use, size, geography and other traits, and the use of broker indications of relative market price metrics. The market approach utilizes comparable use, relative efficiency and other estimates developed by the Company to determine fair value, which are unobservable Level 3 inputs. Unobservable Level 3 inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available. The Company developed its estimates using the best information available at the time.

Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
On the Effective Date, under the terms of the Plan of Reorganization, the Company entered into separate New Miner Equipment Lender Agreements (Election 2) with each holder of an Allowed Miner Equipment Lender Secured Claim that was a Settling Miner Equipment Lender that elected on its ballot to receive and was receiving the Miner Equipment Lender Treatment Election 2 (the “Election 2 Miner Equipment Facility Lenders”), in each case, in the principal amount of eighty percent (
80
%) of each applicable Holders’ Allowed Miner Equipment Lender Claim as of the Effective Date (the “Miner Equipment Lender Facility”).
The maturity date on the Miner Equipment Lender Facility was January 23, 2029. Loans issued under the Miner Equipment Lender Facility accrued interest (1) from the Effective Date to and including the second anniversary of the Effective Date, (x) if the Company did not deliver an Election Notice (as defined below), at a rate of 
13.0
% per annum and was payable 
3.0
% in cash interest and 
10.0
% paid-in-kind, and (y) if the Company delivered a written notice to the Election 2 Miner Equipment Facility Lenders 
five
 (5) business days prior to the due date of any interest payment during this period (an “Election Notice”), the Company could elect to have interest accrue at either (a) 
12.0
% per annum, payable 
5.0
% in cash and 
7.0
% paid-in-kind or (ii) 
8.0
% per annum, payable in cash and (2) following the second anniversary of the Effective Date, at a rate of 
10.0
% per annum, payable in cash. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (as such term is defined in the New Miner Equipment Lender Agreements (Election 2)), the obligations under the Miner Equipment Lender Facility could, at the option of the Election 2 Miner Equipment Facility Lenders, accrue interest at a rate equal to an additional 
2.0
% per annum over the rate otherwise applicable, with such interest being payable in cash on demand. 
Loans issued under the Miner Equipment Lender Facility were secured by a first-priority, duly-perfected and validly enforceable lien on (i) the collateral securing each Election 2 Miner Equipment Facility Lenders’ existing equipment loan/lease and (ii) new, non-financed miners acquired by the Company after the Effective Date, in an aggregate amount of up to $
18.2
 million (collectively, the “Equipment Priority Collateral”).
On the Effective Date, under the terms of the Plan of Reorganization, each Miner Equipment Facility Lender entered into a separate intercreditor agreement with the Secured Convertible Notes Agent, the Secured Notes Agent and the Exit Agent (as defined in the Plan of Reorganization) with respect to the Equipment Priority Collateral.
The present value of the Miner Equipment Lender Facility’s cash flows were estimated to be equal to its par amount, therefore no discount or premium was recorded on issuance.
The Miner Equipment Lender Facility contained customary covenants, representations and warranties.

4.5
 million on the Replacement DIP Facility provided by B. Riley Financial, the Company’s DIP lender. The $
4.5
 million payment included exit fees of approximately $
0.2

 million dated December 29, 2023. The note bore interest at a contractual rate of 
5.0
% per annum and matured on May 2, 2024.

Extinguishments
On the Effective Date, the holders of Secured and Other Convertible Notes received Secured Notes Indenture, New Secured Convertible Notes Indenture, New Common Stock and CVRs. Certain holders of New Secured Convertible Notes also funded and received the Exit Credit Agreement. The exchange and underlying agreements were executed contemporaneously and in contemplation of each other and were analyzed on a combined basis under ASC 470. The Company determined that extinguishment accounting was applicable, as the debt terms in the exchange are substantially different: (a) the present value of the cash flows of the new and remaining instruments differ by more than 10%, (b) the fair value of the conversion option changed by more than 10% of the carrying amount of the original instruments, and (c) a substantive conversion feature was added to the debt terms. The gain on extinguishment is reported in Reorganization items, net.
Two
 previous miner equipment lender loans were exchanged for Miner Equipment Lender Agreements. The Company determined that extinguishment accounting was applicable, as the loans had original maturities near the exchange on the Effective Date. The remaining miner equipment lender loans and leases were exchanged for New Common Stock. The Company determined that extinguishment accounting was applicable, as the remaining miner equipment lender loans and leases were settled by the issuance of equity-classified shares. The gain on extinguishment is reported in Reorganization items, net.

The Company was entitled to prepay the notes prior to maturity. If the notes were prepaid after the first year (including in the event that the notes are accelerated), or if the notes were not paid when due at the stated maturity, the Company was required to pay a premium on the outstanding principal amount equal to: (a)

26.4
 million of New Secured Convertible Notes including interest were voluntarily converted for 
4.5
 million shares of New Common Stock.

20
th consecutive trading day. In connection with the mandatory conversion of the Notes, which took place on July 10, 2024, each registered holder of the New Secured Convertible Notes was entitled to receive (1) a number of shares of the Company’s New Common Stock equal to the aggregate principal amount of his, her or its notes outstanding, divided by the conversion price of $

Following the mandatory conversion of the New Secured Convertible Notes, 
40.1
 million shares of the Company’s New Common Stock in the aggregate were issued in exchange for $
233.6
 million aggregate principal amount of the New Secured Convertible Notes.
Description of the New Secured Convertible Notes Indenture Prior to the Mandatory Conversion
Below is a description of the New Secured Convertible Notes prior to their mandatory conversion on July 10, 2024. There are currently 
no
 outstanding New Secured Convertible Notes.
The New Secured Convertible Notes were secured by a valid and perfected third lien and security interest on substantially all assets of the Company and the guarantors thereof, and which liens were junior in priority to liens securing the Exit Facility and Secured Notes and were subject to the terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement. The New Secured Convertible Notes were guaranteed by all direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company.
Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change (as such term is defined in the New Secured Convertible Notes Indenture), the holders of the New Secured Convertible Notes had the right to require the Company to purchase all or any portion of such holder’s New Secured Convertible Notes at the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the repurchase date. Holders could elect to convert the New Secured Convertible Notes into shares of New Common Stock at any time prior to maturity at an initial conversion rate of 171.48 shares of New Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of New Secured Convertible Notes (equal to a conversion price of $
5.8317
 per share of New Common Stock), which the Company could deliver in cash, New Common Stock or a combination 
112
Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
thereof. The conversion price was subject to anti-dilution adjustments upon (among other triggering events) the occurrence of certain dilutive transactions, including share dividends, splits, combinations and reclassification. The New Secured Convertible Notes also automatically converted into New Common Stock if the volume weighted average price for each day for any 
20
 consecutive trading days was greater than or equal to 
133.6
% of the as-adjusted conversion price of $
7.79
. 
At issuance, the Company identified embedded features in the New Secured Convertible Notes and evaluated them for potential bifurcation in accordance with ASC 815-15. The conversion feature was determined to be indexed to the Company’s own stock and would be classified in equity if it were freestanding meeting a scope exception from derivative accounting under ASC 815. The other identified embedded features were determined to be clearly and closely related to the debt host and not subject to bifurcation.
Convertible debt instruments not specifically addressed in other GAAP are accounted for in accordance with ASC 470-20. Under that guidance a substantial premium is presumed to attributable to the conversion feature. A conversion feature which is not bifurcated as a derivative is initially recognized in equity as additional paid-in capital. The New Secured Convertible Notes were estimated to have a present value of $
293.2
 million on issuance. $
260.0
 million was initially recognized as debt and $
33.2
 million was initially recognized as additional paid-in capital. Under the relevant guidance, neither balance was subject to recognition of recurring remeasurements.
The New Secured Convertible Notes Indenture contained affirmative and negative covenants consistent with those in the Exit Facility and the Secured Notes Indenture that, among other things, limited the ability of the Company and, in certain cases, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur more indebtedness; pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; make investments; grant or permit certain liens; transfer or sell assets; merge or consolidate; and enter into certain transactions with its affiliates.

The Company presented changes in fair value of the Convertible Notes during the periods prior to the Petition Date as follows: (1) the 
10
% contractual rate of interest on the convertible notes (consisting of 
4
% cash interest and 
6
% PIK interest) was presented as interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations; (2) changes in fair value attributable to the Company’s own credit risk were presented within Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss; and (3) other fair value changes were presented within Non-operating expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

At the Petition Date, the accumulated fair value adjustment on the Convertible Notes was $
130.3
 million and the Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to changes in fair value attributable to the Company’s own credit risk was $
72.6
 million. These amounts were derecognized for a gain of $
202.9
 million reported in Reorganization items, net when the Convertible Notes were reclassified as Liabilities subject to compromise during the year ended December 31, 2022.
The fair value of the Company’s Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2021, included the effect of a negotiation discount, which was a calibration adjustment that reflected the illiquidity of the instruments and the Company's negotiating position. Since the transaction was an orderly transaction, the Company deemed that the fair value equaled the transaction price at initial recognition. However, the closing of the merger of XPDI (which represented the occurrence of a qualified financing event as defined by the terms of the notes) in January 2022 resulted in the elimination of the negotiation discount along with other changes in fair value resulted in a significant increase in the fair value of the convertible notes (excluding interest expense and instrument-specific credit risk) for the year up until the Petition Date.

On the Effective Date and pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization and the Confirmation Order, the Company entered into a warrant agreement (the “Warrant Agreement”) providing for the issuance of 
98,313,313
 warrants, each exercisable for 
one
 share of New Common Stock at an exercise price of $
6.81
 per share (the “Tranche 1 Warrants”) and (ii) an aggregate of 
81,927,898
 warrants, each exercisable for 
one
 share of New Common Stock at an exercise price of $
0.01
 per share (the “Tranche 2 Warrants” and, together with the Tranche 1 Warrants, the “Warrants”). Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, holders of the Company’s previous common stock received, for each share of the Company’s previous stock held, 
0.253244
 Tranche 1 Warrants and 
0.211037
 Tranche 2 Warrants.
Each whole Tranche 1 Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase 
one
 whole share of New Common Stock at an exercise price of $
6.81
 per share (the “Tranche 1 Exercise Price”). Each whole Tranche 2 Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase 
one
 whole share of New Common Stock at an exercise price of $
0.01
 per share at any time following the time the volume weighted average price per share of New Common Stock equals or exceeds $
8.72
 per share on each trading day for 
20
 consecutive trading days (the “Triggering Event”), which event occurred on July 11, 2024. The Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 Exercise Prices are subject to adjustment for specific events as set forth in the Warrant Agreement. 
The Tranche 1 Warrants will expire on January 23, 2027, and the Tranche 2 Warrants will expire on January 23, 2029, each at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth in the Warrant Agreement. The Warrant Agreement provides that the Warrant Agreement, with respect to the Tranche 1 Warrants or Tranche 2 Warrants, may be amended with the prior written consent of holders holding a majority of the shares then issuable upon exercise of the Tranche 1 Warrants or Tranche 2 Warrants then outstanding, as applicable; provided, however, that any amendment or supplement to the Warrant Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect any right of a holder of Warrants shall require the written consent of such holder. In addition, the consent of each holder of Warrants affected shall be required for any amendment pursuant to which the applicable exercise price would be increased, the number of shares issuable upon exercise of Warrants would be decreased (other than pursuant to adjustments provided in the Warrant Agreement) or the applicable expiration date would be revised to an earlier date; provided, however, that the Company and the Warrant Agent may amend the Warrant Agreement without the consent of holders of Warrants to (i) to cure any ambiguity; (ii) correct any defective provision; or (iii) make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Warrant Agreement as long as the new provisions do not adversely affect (other than a de minimis adverse effect) the interest of holders of Warrants.

After the issuance of shares of New Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrants, each holder will be entitled to the same rights as holders of New Common Stock.
Pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, holders of Warrants may exercise their Warrants only for a whole number of shares of New Common Stock. If, upon exercise, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, such fractional interest will be rounded to the next higher whole number of the number of shares of New Common Stock to be issued to the holder.

10.         FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis in certain circumstances. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.
The Company uses observable market data when determining fair value whenever possible and relies on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available.
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
Prior to the Petition Date, the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants were recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
. Accordingly, the Company recognized the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjusted the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities were subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value were recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The initial and subsequent fair value estimates of the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants are based on the listed price in an active market for such warrants. After the Petition Date, the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants were transferred to Liabilities subject to compromise at the expected allowed amount of 
zero
 dollars. A gain of $
0.3
 million from the derecognition of the prior fair value is reported in Reorganization items, net for the year ended December 31, 2022.
The Company had elected prior to the Petition Date to measure its Convertible Notes at fair value on a recurring basis because the Company believed it better reflected the underlying economics of the Convertible Notes, which contain multiple embedded derivative features. The fair value of the Company’s convertible notes payable is determined using a market approach based on observable market prices for similar securities when available.
Prior to the three months ended June 30, 2022, when observable market data was not available, the Company used an as-converted value plus risk put option model that included certain unobservable inputs that were significant to the fair value measurement such as probability of a financing event occurring (e.g., a SPAC merger or qualified financing), expected term, volatility and the negotiation discount. The fair value of the Secured Convertible Notes considered the minimum payoff at maturity of 
two
 times the face value of the note plus accrued interest, as well as the opportunity for appreciation if the value of the Company's stock increased 
60
% or more relative to the pricing at the financing event (since the conversion price is set at 
80
% of the stock price at the financing event, a stock price appreciation of 
60
% would match the minimum payoff of 
two
 times the face value plus accrued interest). The fair value of the Other Convertible Notes considered the minimum payoff at maturity of 
one
 times the face value of the note plus accrued interest, as well as the opportunity for appreciation if the value of the Company's stock were to fall no more than 
20
% relative to the pricing at the financing event (since the conversion price is set at 
80
% of the stock price at the financing event, a stock price decline of 
20
% would match the minimum payoff of 
one
 times the face value plus accrued interest). Upon the closing of the Merger Agreement with XPDI in January 2022, the conversion price for the Convertible Notes became fixed at 
80
% of the financing price ($
8.00
 per share of common stock) and the holders now have the right to convert at any time until maturity.
Due to the occurrence of the SPAC merger and the subsequent significant decline in the Company’s stock price below the conversion price, the fair value of the Company’s convertible notes beginning with the three months ended June 30, 2022 was determined using a discounted cash flow model that considered the principal and interest payments, including the minimum payoff at maturity of 
two
 times the face value of the note plus accrued interest for the Secured Convertible Notes and the value of the call option that includes certain unobservable inputs that may be significant to the fair value measurement such as expected term and volatility of the call option.
The CVRs, GUC CVRs and Warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815 and are initially and subsequently measured at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in Net loss. When these instruments were recognized on the

Level 2 Recurring Fair Value Measurements
In October 2023, the Company entered into an energy forward purchase contract to fix a specified component of the energy price related to forecasted energy purchases at the Cottonwood 1 facility from November 1, 2023 through May 31, 2024 (the “Energy Derivatives”). The energy forward purchase contract is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting. The Energy Derivatives are recognized as derivatives in accordance with ASC 815 initially and subsequently measured at fair value with changes in value reflected in Netloss. The Company measures the fair value of its energy forward purchase contract using the discounted cash flow model and uses Intercontinental Exchange forward curves and risk-free rates as observable market inputs.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
The Company’s non-financial assets, including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets (other than digital assets) are measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis and are adjusted only upon impairment or when held for sale. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-08, digital assets were subject to nonrecurring fair value adjustments only when impairment was recognized. Refer to Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 — Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information regarding fair value considerations when measuring impairment.
No non-financial assets were classified as Level 3 as of December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.
The Company’s financial instruments, that are not subject to recurring fair value measurements, include cash and cash equivalents (other than money market funds), restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, leases, notes payable and certain accrued expenses and other liabilities. Except for the 2029 Convertible Notes and 2031 Convertible Notes, the carrying amount of these financial instruments materially approximate their fair values.
 As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the 2029 Convertible Notes and 2031 Convertible Notes using Level 1 active market price was $
703.1
 million and $
615.8
 million, respectively.
11.         COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
Commitments
As of December 31, 2024, the Company was contractually committed for approximately $
1.14
 billion of capital expenditures, primarily related to infrastructure modifications, equipment procurement, and labor associated with the conversion of a significant portion of its data centers to deliver hosting services for HPC. Of this amount, $
899.3
 million is reimbursable by our customer under our agreements. These capital expenditures are expected to occur over the next year.
Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues losses for a legal proceeding when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. However, the uncertainties inherent in legal proceedings make it difficult to reasonably estimate the costs and effects of resolving these matters. Accordingly, actual costs incurred may differ materially from amounts accrued and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Unless otherwise indicated, the Company is unable to estimate reasonably possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued.
Purported Shareholder Class Action (“Pang”)
On November 14, 2022, Plaintiff Mei Pang filed a purported class-action complaint against Core Scientific, Inc., its former chief executive officer,  Michael Levitt, and others in the United States District Court, Western District (Austin) of Texas asserting that the Company violated the Securities and Exchange Act by allegedly failing to disclose to investors that among other things the Company was vulnerable to litigation given its decision to pass power costs to its customers, that certain clients had breached their contracts, and that this impacted the Company’s profitability and ability to continue as a going concern. The complaint seeks monetary damages. Core filed a notice of suggestion of bankruptcy stating that its petition for bankruptcy—filed on December 21, 2022—operates as a stay to the continuation of this matter. Plaintiff subsequently withdrew its claims against Core. A lead plaintiff was appointed in April 2023 and proofs of claim were filed in the Company’s Chapter 11 Cases. After the Company filed its motion to dismiss and a subsequent motion for consideration with respect to remaining claims not dismissed, all remaining claims in the complaint against the individual defendants were subsequently dismissed without prejudice in April 2024.

Equity Line of Credit
In July 2022, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the “Equity Line of Credit”) and a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with B. Riley. Pursuant to the Equity Line of Credit, the Company had the right to sell to B. Riley, up to $
100.0
 million of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share (the “ELOC Common Stock”), subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Equity Line of Credit, from time to time during the term of the Equity Line of Credit. Sales of ELOC Common Stock pursuant to the Equity Line of Credit, and the timing of any sales, were solely at the Company’s option, and the Company was under no obligation to sell any securities to B. Riley under the Equity Line of Credit. The Equity Line of Credit was terminated as a result of the Plan of Reorganization and the obligations of the parties under the Equity Line of Credit were extinguished.
As consideration for B. Riley’s commitment to purchase shares of Common Stock at the Company’s direction upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Equity Line of Credit, upon execution of the Equity Line of Credit in July 2022, the Company issued 
0.6

SPAC Vesting Shares
1.7
 million common shares are subject to vesting requirements, as described further in Note 4 — Business Combination and Restructuring. These contingently issuable shares do not require future service in order to vest and do not result in stock-based compensation expense. The SPAC Vesting Shares are accounted for as an equity contract, and meet the criteria for equity classification. The Company has recorded the SPAC Vesting Shares within additional paid-in capital on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023.
Vendor Settlement
In March 2022, the Company issued 
1.6
 million shares of the Company’s common stock related to a vendor liability that had been assumed by the Company in July 2021 as part of the Blockcap acquisition. In addition, the vendor liability required settlement in cash based on the difference between the weighted average of the closing price of the Company’s common stock for each day there was a closing price during the 
thirty
 consecutive days immediately prior to the expiration of the lockup period (defined in the agreement as 
180
 days from the date from the closing of the XPDI merger) and the $
21.3
 million contractual amount of the liability. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $
9.5
 million, within Other non-operating expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to changes in the fair value of the vendor liability. There were 
no
 changes in the fair value of the vendor liability during the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the liability of $
18.1
 million was recorded within Liabilities subject to compromise on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Equity Incentive Plans
At the Special Meeting in connection with the XPDI Merger, the stockholders of XPDI approved the Core Scientific, Inc. 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). Awards granted under the 2021 Plan may be incentive stock options (subject to satisfaction of applicable statutory requirements), non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and stock units, performance awards and other cash-based or stock-based awards. Awards granted under the 2021 Plan are subject to a minimum vesting period of at least 
one year
 commencing from the date of grant. Additionally, options granted under the plan must expire within 
ten years
 of the grant date and must be granted with exercise prices of no less than the fair value of the common stock on the grant date, as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. Following the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company expects that its Board of Directors will make grants of awards under the 2021 Plan to eligible participants. The maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be issued under the 2021 Plan is 
45.0
 million shares. As of the Effective date of the Plan of Reorganization, the Company no longer grants equity incentive awards under the 2021 Plan.
Equity Rights Offering
On November 20, 2023, the Company commenced an equity rights offering (the “Equity Rights Offering”) of common shares of the reorganized Company (the “ERO Shares”) in an aggregate amount of $
55
 million. On the Effective Date, the Company issued 
15,648,896
 shares on account of the Equity Rights Offering in exchange for the cash proceeds. Also, on November 16, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Backstop Commitment Letter”) with the parties named therein (the “Commitment Parties”), pursuant to which the Commitment Parties agreed to severally and not jointly backstop $
37.1
 million of the Equity Rights Offering (the “Backstop Commitment”), subject to the terms and conditions of the Backstop Commitment Letter. The subscription period for the ERO expired on January 5, 2024. The Equity Rights Offering was oversubscribed and the aggregate subscriptions (including over subscriptions) exceeded the number of ERO Shares offered to be purchased as part of the Equity Rights Offering. The results of the

Equity Rights Offering rendered the previously arranged Backstop Commitment unnecessary, however, on the Effective Date, the Company issued 
2,111,178
 New Common Stock shares on account of the underlying backstop fee associated with the Backstop Commitment.
Emergence from Bankruptcy
As disclosed in Note 1 — Organization and Description of Business, on December 21, 2022, the Debtors filed the Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
On January 15, 2024, the Debtors filed with the Bankruptcy Court the Plan of Reorganization, and on January 16, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order. 
On the Effective Date, the Plan of Reorganization became effective in accordance with its terms and the Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases. On the Effective Date, in connection with the effectiveness of, and pursuant to the terms of, the Plan of Reorganization and the Confirmation Order, the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately before the Effective Date was canceled and is of no further force or effect, and the new organizational documents of the Company became effective, authorizing the issuance of shares of common stock, par value $
0.00001
 per share (the “New Common Stock”). In accordance with the foregoing, on the Effective Date, the Company, as reorganized on the Effective Date and in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, issued the: (i) New Common Stock, (ii) Warrants, (iii) CVRs, (iv) New Secured Convertible Notes, (v) Secured Notes and (vi) the GUC CVRs (each, as defined below). Such securities, rights, or interests were issued in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) provided by section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code.
On the Effective Date, all equity interests in the Company that existed immediately prior to the Effective Date were cancelled, including the Company’s then-existing common stock and warrants, and the Company issued or caused to be issued the New Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Plan of Reorganization.
On the Effective Date, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the Company issued or held in reserve as issuable:
•
176,266,782
 shares of New Common Stock;
•
4,725,091
 shares of New Common Stock held in reserve for disputed claims;
•
180,241,211
 Warrants, composed of 
98,313,313
 Tranche 1 Warrants and 
81,927,898
 Tranche 2 Warrants;
•
51,783,625
 CVRs; and
•
GUC CVRs.
The 
4,725,091
 shares of New Common Stock held in reserve for disputed claims will be distributed in settlement of previously disputed claims which become allowed by the Bankruptcy Court. On the one-year anniversary from the Effective Date, or at such earlier date as all disputed claims are considered resolved, any reserved shares not distributed in settlement of previously disputed claims which become allowed will be issued to holders of the common stock immediately prior to the Effective Date. As these shares will be issued and only the recipient is contingent, the Company accounts for these shares as outstanding in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the Basic and Diluted Weighted average shares outstanding in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Shares estimated by the Company to be issued to disputed claims are included in the gain on satisfaction of the GUC claims reported in Reorganization items, net.

In accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, the Company adopted an equity-based management incentive plan on April 26, 2024 (the “Incentive Plan”). The Incentive Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, dividend equivalent rights and other stock-based awards.
The Incentive Plan provides for grants of up to 
40,000,000
 shares of the Company’s Common Stock in respect of awards, subject to adjustment as provided in the Incentive Plan, and limits the aggregate compensation that may be paid to the Company’s non-employee directors in respect of any single fiscal year (including awards under the Incentive Plan) to a total of $
800,000
.
The form of outstanding grants under the Incentive Plan currently includes RSUs and MSUs. The participants in the Incentive Plan, the timing and allocations of the awards to participants, and the other terms and conditions of such awards (including, but not limited to, vesting, exercise prices, base values, hurdles, forfeiture, repurchase rights and transferability) is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in its discretion, as plan administrator.
Under the Incentive Plan, certain executives have been granted MSUs which are subject to the achievement of market-based share price goals and the executives’ continued service until the relevant vesting date. The number of shares which vest as of the end of each measurement period on each vesting date are conditioned on the highest 
20
-day volume weighted average price of the Company's share price achieved during the tranche’s measurement vesting period since grant. The MSU vesting schedule is proportionate over a 
three-year
 service period where such proportions are identified as tranches with separate service conditions and measurement periods for the market conditions. If certain market-based share price goals are not met during certain tranche measurement periods, the ability to satisfy such goals apply in subsequent measurement periods and permit vesting if such market conditions are then met (and the service conditions are then satisfied). 
The following table presents additional information relating to each MSU award:

Stock-Based Compensation
Stock Options
—Stock options granted under the 2018 Plan were granted at a price per share not less than the fair value at the date of grant. Options granted vest over 
4
 years and are exercisable for up to 
10
 years. 
No
 stock options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023. Determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date required judgment, including estimating the expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. 
Expected Term
—
The Company’s expected term was determined using the simplified method and represents the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term of the awards.
Expected Volatility
—The Company’s volatility factor was estimated using comparable public company volatility for similar terms.
Risk-Free Interest Rate—
The Company based the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model on the implied yield currently available on US Treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. Where the expected term of the Company’s stock-based awards did not correspond with the term for which an interest rate was quoted, the Company performed a straight-line interpolation to determine the rate from the available term maturities.
Expected Dividends
—
The Company has no history of paying cash dividends and has no present intention to pay common stock cash dividends in the future; as a result, the expected dividend yield was 
0
% for the stock options that were granted.

13.         INCOME TAXES
Current income tax expense represents the amount expected to be reported on the Company’s income tax returns, and deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be realized. The Company had $
0.9
 million and $
0.7
 million of income tax expense, and $
17.1
 million of income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required on deferred tax assets considers the evaluation of both positive and negative evidence when concluding whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable. After reviewing the positive and negative evidence available, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $
183.1
 million. The valuation allowance primarily relates to deferred tax assets for fixed assets, deferred interest carryforwards, net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of $
312.4
 million and $
128.1
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of $
330.2
 million and $
106.6
 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss can be carried forward indefinitely, however the utilization of the federal net operating loss for a tax year is equal to the lesser of (1) the aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers to such year, plus the net operating carrybacks to such tax year, or (2) 80% of taxable income determined without regard to the deduction. The Company's state net operating loss carryforwards expiration periods range from 2035 to indefinite. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had U.S. federal and state capital loss carryforwards of $
220.7
 million and $
42.4
 million, respectively. The capital loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2028. 
In addition, the Company's net operating loss may be subject to utilization limitations due to changes of control, as defined by tax law under Internal Revenue Code Sections 382. Similar provisions may subject the capital loss carryforwards to utilization limitation. 
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had an unrecognized tax benefit of $
0.6
 million and $
0.3
 million, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense. The Company continues to believe its positions are supportable; however, due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, the Company's estimates of the ultimate settlement of uncertain tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ from the estimates.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions. The Company’s 2020 through 2024 tax years are subject to U.S. federal and state examination.
14.         NET LOSS PER SHARE 
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is measured as the income or loss available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Upon exercise of the Tranche 2 Warrants, shares are issuable for little or no consideration, sometimes referred to as “penny warrants”. Under ASC 260-10-45-13, those issuable shares are considered outstanding in the computation of basic EPS whether or not related warrants have been exercised. At December 31, 2024, approximately 
21.1
 million shares of common stock remain issuable upon the exercise of the Tranche 2 Warrants and are included in the number of outstanding shares used for the computation of basic EPS for the year then ended. Additionally, the basic EPS numerator includes an adjustment to eliminate the changes in fair value that have been recognized in Net loss from the close of trading on July 11, 2024 through December 31, 2024, the period in which the Tranche 2 Warrants were exercisable and therefore included in weighted average share calculations. Changes in fair value from Emergence through the close of trading on July 11, 2024 remain in Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Diluted EPS includes and presents the dilutive effect on EPS from the potential issuance of shares from unvested restricted stock units, conversion of convertible securities, or the exercise of options and/or warrants. The potentially dilutive effect of convertible securities are calculated using the if-converted method. The potentially dilutive effect of options or warrants are computed 
132
Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
using the treasury stock method. When potentially dilutive securities have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., increase income per share or decrease loss per share), they are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
The following table sets forth reconciliations of the numerators and denominators used to compute basic and diluted loss per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):

15.         SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company’s operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments only if they exhibit similar economic characteristics and have similar business activities.
The Company now has 
three
 operating segments: “Digital Asset Self-Mining”, consisting of performing digital asset mining for its own account; “Digital Asset Hosted Mining”, consisting of providing hosting services to third-parties for digital asset mining; and “HPC Hosting”, consisting of providing hosting services to third parties for GPU-based HPC operations. The Company’s HPC  operations met the criteria to be considered a new segment during the second quarter of 2024. The Digital Asset Self-Mining segment generates revenue from operating owned digital infrastructure and computer equipment as part of a pool of users that process transactions conducted on one or more blockchain networks. In exchange for these services, the Company receives digital assets. The Digital Asset Hosted Mining business generates revenue through the sale of consumption-based contracts for its digital asset hosted mining services which are recurring in nature. The HPC Hosting business generates revenue through licensing agreements and orders with licensees that include fixed and variable payments on a recurring basis.
The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The CODM uses gross profit to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Gross profit is used to evaluate actual results against expectations, which are based on comparable prior results, current budget, and current forecast. Gross profit is also used in deciding how profits and cash flows will be reinvested or otherwise deployed. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 on January 1, 2024. The most significant provision was for the Company to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM. Power fees, depreciation expense, employee compensation and facility operations expense were determined to be significant segment expenses. The CODM does not evaluate performance or allocate resources based on segment asset or liability information; accordingly, the Company has not presented a measure of assets by segment. The segments’ accounting policies are the same as those described in the summary of 
133
Core Scientific, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
significant accounting policies. The Company excludes certain operating expenses and other expenses from the allocations to operating segments.

Concentrations of Revenue and Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is concentrated with a small number of customers. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions, which management assesses to be of high credit quality, in order to limit the exposure to credit risk. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of the Company’s fixed assets were located in the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, all of the Company’s revenue was generated in the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022,

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures
Not applicable.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) prior to the filing of this annual report. 
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.
Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting consists of policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) are designed and operated to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and our process for the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the "COSO Framework"). Based on our management’s evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. 
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Marcum LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included below.
Remediation of Prior Year Material Weaknesses
At December 31, 2023, the Company disclosed material weaknesses related to management’s inability to design and implement program change management controls for certain financially relevant systems, related to user access provisioning controls over appropriate segregation of duties and related to controls to ensure transactions were recorded timely and in accordance with GAAP. 
Throughout 2024, management executed the following actions to fully remediate the prior year material weaknesses: 
•
improved IT application-specific and general controls to manage access and program changes across our key systems;
•
increased the depth, experience and communication within our accounting and finance organization;
•
enhanced the design, coordination and documentation of controls over transactions, financial reporting, and inputs into period-end disclosures; and
•
updated internal reporting procedures, including enhancing the analytical procedures used to assess period-end balances, to add depth to our review process and improve our segregation of duties.
138
To support our conclusion, management designed processes and controls in support of these remediation activities that were implemented and tested throughout the year and determined to be effective.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the year ended December 31, 2024, except for the remediation actions described above, there was no change in Core Scientific, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. Similarly, an evaluation of controls cannot provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Core Scientific, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Core Scientific Inc.'s (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in contingently redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes of the Company (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”), and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting”. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
