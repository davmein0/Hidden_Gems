Item 1A. Risk Factors
Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” before deciding to invest in our securities. Although we have organized risks generally according to t
hese categories
 in the discussion below, many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. These categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks we face and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. If any of the events or developments described below were to occur, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could suffer materially, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may also adversely affect our business.
Summary of Selected Risk Factors Associated with an Investment in Our Securities
The following is a summary of the principal risks associated with an investment in our securities:
•
Our success depends in large part on our ability to timely and successfully convert our existing facilities to support our HPC customers and to attract new HPC customers. Delays in the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities or significant cost overruns could present significant risks to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations
.
•
Currently our HPC business is highly dependent on a single customer.
•
Our increased focus on HPC hosting may not be successful and depends on the continuing development and resource and computational requirements of HPC hosting applications such as cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence and continuing need for the infrastructure and services we provide. If our target customer markets, which are new and still developing, do not grow or develop as expected or in a manner consistent with our current business model, our business, financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected.
•
Our success is also dependent on our ability to earn bitcoin profitably, and we may not be able to maintain our competitive position as the Bitcoin network experience increases in total network hash rate.
•
Our business is capital intensive, we will need to raise additional capital, and failure to obtain the necessary capital when needed will force us to delay, limit or terminate our expansion efforts or other operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
We are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electric power and the limited availability of electrical power and resources, equipment and materials designed to provide usable electrical power within our facilities. In addition, public sentiment regarding electrical power generation, usage and storage, high volume electrical use and climate change, may limit our access to electrical power, decrease available facility sites, and increase our costs and limit the demand for our HPC colocation services.  An inability to purchase and develop additional sources of low-cost sources of energy effectively or to obtain real estate, materials and equipment to operate our facilities efficiently will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
Any failure in our critical systems, facilities or services we provide could lead to disruptions in our and our customers’ businesses and could harm our reputation and result in financial penalty and legal liabilities, which would reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
If there are significant changes to the method of validating blockchain transactions, such changes could reduce demand for our blockchain hosting services.
•
We may be vulnerable to physical security breaches, which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
A slowdown in market and economic conditions, particularly those impacting the cloud computing, machine learning and AI industries, the demand for HPC infrastructure and services, and the blockchain industry and the blockchain hosting market, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
Digital assets, and bitcoin in particular, are subject to price volatility. The value of bitcoin is dependent on a number of factors, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Table of Contents
•
The “halving” of rewards available on the Bitcoin network, or the reduction of rewards on other networks, has had and in the future could have a negative impact on our ability to generate revenue as our customers may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and customers may cease mining operations altogether, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
If the award of bitcoin and/or transaction fees for solving blocks is not sufficiently high to incentivize transaction processors, such processors may reduce or cease expending processing power on a particular network, which could negatively impact the utility of the network, reduce the value of its bitcoin and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
The cash needs of our HPC hosting growth initiatives will limit the amount of digital assets we hold, thus preventing us from recognizing any gain from the appreciation in value of the digital assets we have sold and may sell in the future. 
•
Any change in the interpretive positions of the SEC or its staff with respect to digital asset mining firms could have a material adverse effect on us.
•
Recent developments have increased the likelihood that U.S. federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies will enact laws and regulations to regulate digital assets and digital asset intermediaries, such as digital asset exchanges and custodians.
•
Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from government regulators, investors, lenders, customers, and other market participants with respect to Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks. 
•
Our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.
•
We may not have adequate sources of recovery if the bitcoin or other digital assets held by us are lost, stolen or destroyed due to third-party digital asset services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
Our actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our historical financial results or our projections filed with the Bankruptcy Court or otherwise made public in the course of the Chapter 11 Cases.
Risks Related to our Businesses and Industries
Our success depends in large part on our ability to timely and successfully convert our existing facilities to support our HPC customers and to attract new HPC customers. Delays in the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities or significant cost overruns could present significant risks to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our ability to timely and successfully convert our existing facilities to support our HPC customers will be negatively impacted by:
•
deficiencies, delays or failures in performance by construction firms retained to build, build-out or remodel our facilities;  
•
disruptions in the supply chain or excessive demand for construction materials, electrical transformers, generators and other materials used in high performance data centers that delay receipt of, or make unavailable, required supplies, materials and equipment;
•
difficulties in generating sufficient cash flow or obtaining necessary financing that delay or prevent the completion of planned facilities;
•
failure to timely pay construction costs and expenses, including failure on the part of our customers to pay or reimburse costs and expenses when due; or
•
delays in obtaining necessary government approvals, receipt of power allocations, land acquisitions and easements, as well as change orders, modification to designs and construction plans that delay construction, increase costs or that reduce the usable electrical power footprint.
Currently our HPC business is highly dependent on a single customer.
One customer, CoreWeave, currently accounts for 100% of our HPC Hosting segment revenue.  Our success in the HPC Hosting segment is highly dependent on the success of CoreWeave and the fulfillment by it of its obligations under our existing contractual arrangements. Any failure to meet CoreWeave’s expectations, including, but not limited to, failure to fulfill our contractual 
14
Table of Contents
obligations, could result in cancellation or non-renewal of our business relationship, or harm to our business relationship that could impact our future growth and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our increased focus on HPC hosting may not be successful and depends on the continuing development 
and resource and computational requirements of HPC hosting applications  such as cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence and continuing need for the infrastructure and services we provide. If our target customer markets, which are new and still developing, do not grow or develop as expected or in a manner consistent with our current business model, our business, financial condition and results of operation would be adversely affected. Further, increases in power costs could negatively impact our hosting customers’ demand for services, harm our growth prospects and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our success also depends in large part on our ability to attract additional customers and retain our existing customer for our HPC Hosting capabilities in a profitable manner, which we may not be able to do if:
•
there is a reduction in the demand for HPC hosting applications such as cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence;  
•
rapid innovation and technological disruption in cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence decrease computational requirements and therefore lower demand for our HPC hosting offerings;
•
high energy costs, supply chain disruptions (including labor availability), government regulation, and compliance costs increase HPC hosting service costs, reduces potential demand for services and reduce revenue and profitability;
•
we fail to provide competitive hosting terms or effectively market them to potential customers;
•
we provide hosting services that are deemed by existing and potential customers or suppliers to be inferior to those of our competitors, or that fail to meet customers’ or suppliers’ ongoing and evolving program qualification standards, based on a range of factors, including available power, preferred design features, security considerations and connectivity;
•
businesses decide to host internally as an alternative to the use of our services;
•
we fail to successfully communicate the benefits of our services to potential customers;
•
we are unable to strengthen awareness of our brand; or
•
we are unable to provide services that our existing and potential customers desire.
Our success in our digital asset segments depends in large part on our ability to earn bitcoin in a profitable manner. In the past, increases in power costs have impacted our ability to earn digital assets efficiently and reduced bitcoin pricing have reduced our operating margins. Future increases in power costs and unfavorable prices for digital assets will harm our growth prospects and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our success 
in our digital asset segments
 depends in large part on our ability to earn bitcoin and to provide services to the customers of our hosting capabilities in a profitable manner, which we may not be able to do if:
•
there is a reduction in the demand for bitcoin causing the price of bitcoin to fall reducing revenue from our self-mining operations;
•
high energy costs, supply chain disruptions or government regulation compliance costs increase mining costs and reduce revenue and profitability; or
•
we are unable to secure an adequate supply of new generation digital asset mining equipment.
We may not be able to maintain our competitive position as the Bitcoin network experiences increases in total network hash rate.
As the relative market prices of a digital asset, such as bitcoin, increases, more companies are encouraged to mine for that digital asset and as more miners are added to the network, its total hash rate increases. In order for us to maintain our competitive position under such circumstances, we must increase our total hash rate by acquiring and deploying more mining machines, including new miners with higher hash rates. There are currently only a few companies capable of producing a sufficient number of machines with adequate quality to address the increased demand. If we are not able to acquire and deploy additional miners on a timely basis, our proportion of the overall network hash rate will decrease and we will have a lower chance of solving new blocks which will have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

As more processing power is added to a network, our relative percentage of total processing power on that network is expected to decline absent significant capital investment, which has an adverse impact on our ability to generate revenue from processing transactions on that network and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Processing power on networks has been increasing rapidly over time while the rewards and transaction fees available on those networks tends to decline over time. In order to grow or maintain the revenue we generate from processing transactions on such networks, we are required to invest significant capital to acquire new computer servers, expand our power capacity and otherwise increase our effective processing power on such networks. In the event we are unable to invest sufficient capital to grow or maintain the level of our processing power on a network relative to the total processing power of such network, our revenue from the applicable network will decline over time and as a result, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, a decrease in the price of computer servers may result in an increase in transaction processors, which may lead to more competition for fees in a particular network. In the event we are unable to realize adequate fees on a network due to increased competition, our revenue from the applicable network will decline over time and in turn, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business is capital intensive, and failure to obtain the necessary capital when needed will force us to delay, limit or terminate our expansion efforts or other operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The costs of constructing, developing, operating and maintaining our HPC and digital mining facilities, and owning and operating a large fleet of the latest generation digital mining equipment, are substantial.
Our HPC hosting operations may be impacted by costs and expenses beyond our control or require capital investment that neither we nor our customers are able to bear, reducing our revenue and profitability.
Our digital asset mining operation can only be successful and ultimately profitable if the costs, including hardware and electricity costs, associated with earning digital assets are lower than the price of the digital assets we earn. Falling digital asset prices or asset prices that do not keep pace with higher energy prices, significantly higher energy prices, inflation and supply chain disruptions reduce our profitability. Our miners experience ordinary wear and tear from operation and may also face more significant malfunctions caused by factors which may be beyond our control, increasing our costs and reducing our revenue and profitability. The continual upgrade and refresh of mining machines requires substantial capital investment, and we may face challenges in doing so on a timely basis based on availability of new miners and our access to adequate capital resources. If we are unable to obtain adequate numbers of new and replacement miners at scale, we may be unable to remain competitive in our highly competitive and evolving industry. 
Moreover, in order to grow our hosting business, we may need additional facilities to increase our capacity for more miners. The costs of constructing, developing, operating and maintaining hosting facilities and growing our hosting operations may not be profitable or possible. 
We may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings in order to meet our operating and capital needs. Raising additional debt or equity financing may be difficult and may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. An inability to generate sufficient cash from operations or to obtain additional debt or equity financing have adversely affected our results of operations.
Our business is highly dependent on a small number of digital asset mining equipment suppliers.
Our business is highly dependent upon a few digital asset mining equipment suppliers providing an adequate and timely supply of new generation digital asset mining machines at economical prices. The growth in our business is dependent in large part on the availability of new generation mining machines offered for sale at a price conducive to profitable digital asset mining, as well as the trading price of digital assets such as bitcoin. The market price and availability of new mining machines fluctuates with the price of bitcoin and can be volatile. Higher bitcoin prices increase the demand for mining equipment and increases the cost. In addition, as more companies seek to enter the mining industry, the demand for machines may outpace supply and create mining machine equipment shortages. Digital asset mining equipment suppliers, may not be able to keep pace with any surge in demand for mining equipment. Further, manufacturing mining machine purchase contracts are not favorable to purchasers and we may have little or no recourse in the event a mining machine manufacturer defaults on its mining machine delivery commitments. If we are not able to 
16
Table of Contents
obtain a sufficient number of digital asset mining machines at favorable prices, our growth expectations, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will be negatively impacted.
Miner manufacturers may continue requiring significant advance deposits before orders are fulfilled and delivered. 
Historically, miner manufacturers have required advance deposits for miner purchases. These deposits tie up significant amounts of cash several months before mining machines are received and operable to generate revenue. These advance deposits further drive the financial burden of operating a capital-intensive business. Miner manufacturers holding a deposit from the Company may go out of business before delivering purchased miners, or for other reasons fail to deliver the miners associated with the deposit. There is no certainty that, in such circumstances, the Company would succeed in recovering any of its deposit, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our reliance on third-party mining pool service providers for our earned mining reward payouts may have a negative impact on our operations.
We utilize third party mining pools to receive our earned mining rewards from a given network. Mining pools allow mining participants to combine their processing power, which increases the chances of solving a block and the pool getting paid by the network. Contractually determined rewards are distributed by the pool operator, proportionally to our contribution to the pool’s overall mining power used to generate each block. We are dependent on the accuracy of the mining pool operator’s record keeping to accurately record our proportion of the total processing power provided to the pool. While we have internal methods of tracking both our power provided and the total power used by the pool, the mining pool operator uses its own method to determine our proportion of the pool’s total rewards. We have little means of recourse against the mining pool operator if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by a mining pool operator is incorrect, other than leaving the pool. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our mining pool operators, we may experience reduced reward for our efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operations.
If we do not accurately predict our facility requirements, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The costs of building out, leasing and maintaining our facilities constitute a significant portion of our capital and operating expenses. In order to manage growth and ensure adequate capacity for our new and existing HPC hosting customers while minimizing unnecessary excess capacity costs, we continuously evaluate our short- and long-term data center capacity requirements. If we overestimate our business’ capacity requirements or the demand for our services and therefore secure excess data center capacity, our operating margins could be materially reduced. If we underestimate our data center capacity requirements, we may not be able to service the required or expanding needs of our existing customers and may be required to limit new customer acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to risks associated with our need for significant electric power and the limited availability of electrical power and resources, equipment and materials designed to provide usable electrical power within our facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. An inability to purchase and develop additional sources of low-cost sources of energy effectively or to obtain real estate, materials and equipment to operate our facilities efficiently will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our businesses require a significant amount of electric power. The costs of electric power account for a significant portion of our cost of revenue. We require a significant electric power supply to conduct our mining activity and to provide many hosting services we offer, such as powering and cooling our and our customers’ servers and network equipment and operating critical mining and facility and equipment infrastructure.
The amount of power required by us and our customers will increase commensurate with the demand for our services and the increase in miners we operate for ourselves and our hosting customers. Energy costs and availability are vulnerable to seasonality, with increased costs primarily in the summer months and risks of outages and power grid damage as a result of inclement weather, animal incursion, sabotage and other events out of our control. Higher than expected power rates in 2022 materially impacted our operations.
We aim to build and operate energy efficient facilities, but such facilities may not be able to deliver sufficient power to meet the growing needs of our business. The cost of power at our facilities is dependent on our ability to perform under the terms in the power contracts we are a party to, which we may be unable to do successfully. Pursuant to power contracts that require curtailment, if we fail to curtail our power usage when called upon or fail to satisfy certain eligibility requirements for monthly bill credits, our power costs would increase. Further, governments and government regulators may potentially seek to restrict or prohibit the ability of electricity 
17
Table of Contents
suppliers to provide electricity to our facilities in times of electricity shortage or otherwise. To that end, public sentiment regarding electrical power generation, usage and storage, high volume electrical use and climate change, may limit our access to electrical power, decrease available facility sites, and increase our costs and limit the demand for our HPC colocation services. Any system downtime resulting from disruptions, curtailments, insufficient power resources or power outages could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our HPC operations run on back-up generators in the event of a power outage or curtailment that may not be sufficient to support our operations for the magnitude or duration of the power outage or curtailment. Increased power costs and limited availability and curtailment of power resources will reduce our revenue and have a material and adverse effect on our cost of revenue and results of operations.
If we fail to accurately estimate the factors upon which we base our contract pricing, we may generate less profit than expected or incur losses on those contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our hosting contracts are generally priced on the basis of estimated power consumption by our clients and the other costs of providing electrical power and other services. Our ability to earn a profit on such contracts requires that we accurately estimate the costs involved and outcomes likely to be achieved, provide services efficiently and assess the probability of generating sufficient hosting capacity within budgeted costs and expenses during the contracted time period. In addition, we may not be able to obtain all expected benefits, including tax abatements or government incentives offered in opportunity zones. The inability to accurately estimate the factors upon which we base our contract pricing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Any failure in our critical systems, facilities or services we provide could lead to disruptions in our and our customers’ businesses and could harm our reputation and result in financial penalty and legal liabilities, which would reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations
.
The critical systems of the facilities we operate and the services we provide are subject to failure. Any failure in the critical systems of any facility we operate or services that we provide, including a breakdown in critical plant, equipment or services, routers, switches or other equipment, power supplies or network connectivity, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions impacting our operations as well as equipment damage, which could significantly disrupt our business operations and the operations of our customers, harm our reputation and reduce our revenue. Any failure or downtime in one of the facilities that we operate impact mining rewards generated by us and reduce the profitability of our customers.
The total destruction or severe impairment of any of the facilities we operate could result in significant downtime of our operations and services and loss of customer data. Since our ability to generate revenue depends on our ability to provide highly reliable service, even minor interruptions in our operations could harm our reputation and negatively impact our revenue and profitability. Our ability to generate revenue and the services we provide are subject to failures resulting from numerous factors, including:
•
power loss, curtailment and disruption;
•
equipment failure;
•
human error or accidents;
•
theft, sabotage and vandalism;
•
failure by us or our suppliers to provide adequate service or maintain our equipment;
•
network connectivity downtime and fiber cuts;
•
service interruptions resulting from server relocation;
•
security breaches of our infrastructure;
•
improper building maintenance;
•
physical, electronic and cybersecurity breaches;
•
animal incursions;
•
fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood and other natural disasters;
•
extreme temperatures;
•
water damage;
18
Table of Contents
•
public health emergencies; 
•
riots, protests and disorder; and
•
terrorism, war and hostilities.
Moreover, service interruptions and equipment failures may expose us to potential legal liability. As our services are critical to our customers’ business operations, any disruption in our services could result in lost profits of or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers. Our customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability for breach of such agreements, a court may not enforce any contractual limitations on our liability in the event that one of our customers brings a lawsuit against us as the result of a service interruption that they may ascribe to us. The outcome of any such lawsuit would depend on the specific facts of the case and any legal and policy considerations that we may not be able to mitigate. In such cases, we could be liable for substantial damage awards, which would as a result have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may be vulnerable to physical security breaches, which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
A party who is able to compromise the physical security measures protecting our facilities could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations and misappropriate our property or the property of our customers. As we provide assurances to our customers that we provide the highest level of security, such a compromise could be particularly harmful to our brand and reputation. We may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security. As techniques used to breach security change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may not be able to implement new security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, we may not be certain whether these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, regulatory penalties, loss of existing or potential customers, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Physical risks and regulatory changes relating to climate change may impact our costs, our access to materials and resources and demand for cryptocurrencies, potentially adversely impacting our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
The physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy, demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and could increase our insurance and other operating costs, including, potentially, to repair damage incurred as a result of extreme weather events or to renovate or retrofit facilities to better withstand extreme weather events. 
In addition, efforts are being made by the United States and foreign governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly those from coal combustion power plants, some of which plants we may rely upon for power. The added cost of any environmental taxes, charges, assessments or penalties levied on such power plants could be passed on to us, increasing the cost to run our facilities.
If our operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, or if environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on our operations, our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be adversely impacted.
We may be exposed to cybersecurity threats and breaches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in our businesses. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent these, our computer servers and computer systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer servers and computer systems. The preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber-attack in the future. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our network, in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or in a loss of our digital assets, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, lead to claims against us and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.

Table of Contents
In addition, any assertions of alleged security breaches or systems failure made against us, whether true or not, could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial legal fees and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Our digital infrastructure could be breached despite our security procedures.
Our operational digital infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of one of our employees, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our digital asset accounts, private keys, data or digital assets. Although we implement a number of security procedures with various elements such as two-factor verification, segregated accounts and secured facilities and plan to implement the maintenance of data on computers and/or storage media that is not directly connected to, or accessible from, the internet and/or networked with other computers (“cold storage”), to minimize the risk of loss, damage and theft, and we update such security procedures whenever reasonably practicable, we may be unable to prevent such loss, damage or theft, whether caused intentionally, accidentally or by an act of God.
Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. As technological change occurs, the security threats to our bitcoin will likely adapt and previously unknown threats may emerge. Our ability to adopt technology in response to changing security needs or trends may pose a challenge to the safekeeping of our digital assets. To the extent we are unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats, our digital assets may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack.
Any of these events could expose us to liability, damage our reputation, reduce customer confidence in our services and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we believe that as our assets grow, we may become a more appealing target for security threats, such as hackers and malware. If an actual or perceived breach of our digital asset accounts occurs, the market perception of our effectiveness could be harmed.
Our future success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make our current or future technologies less competitive or obsolete.
Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes continue to impact our industry. The infrastructure at our facilities may become less marketable due to demand for new processes and technologies, including, without limitation: (i) new processes to deliver power to, or eliminate heat from, computer systems; (ii) customer demand for additional redundancy capacity; (iii) new technology that permits higher levels of critical load and heat removal than our facilities are currently designed to provide; (iv) an inability of the power supply to support new, updated or upgraded technology; and (v) a shift to more power-efficient transaction validation protocols. In addition, the systems that connect our facilities to the internet and other external networks may become insufficient, including with respect to latency, reliability and diversity of connectivity. 
Even if we succeed in adapting to new processes and technologies, our use of such new processes or technology may not have a positive impact on our financial performance. For example, we could incur substantial additional costs if we needed to materially improve our hosting center infrastructure through the implementation of new systems or new server technologies that require levels of critical load and heat removal that our facilities are not currently designed to provide. In addition, if one of our new offerings were competitive to our prior offerings and represented an adequate or superior alternative, customers could decide to abandon prior offerings that produce higher revenue or better margins for the new offering. Therefore, the adaptation to new processes and technologies could result in lower revenue, lower margins and/or higher costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If there are significant changes to the method of validating blockchain transactions, such changes could reduce demand for digital assets like bitcoin.
New digital asset transaction protocols are continuously being deployed, and existing and new protocols are in a state of constant change and development. While certain validation protocols currently employ a “proof-of-work” consensus algorithm, whereby transaction processors are required to expend significant amounts of electrical and computing power to solve complex mathematical problems in order to validate transactions and create new blocks in a blockchain, there may be a shift towards adopting alternative validating protocols. These protocols may include a “proof-of-stake” algorithm or an algorithm based on a protocol other than proof-of-work, which may decrease the reliance on computing power as an advantage to validating blocks. Our mining operations are currently designed to primarily support a proof-of-work consensus algorithm. Should the algorithm shift from a proof-of-work 
20
Table of Contents
validation method to a proof-of-stake method, mining would require less energy and may render any company that maintains advantages in the current climate (for example, from lower priced electricity, processing, real estate or hosting) less competitive.
As a result of our efforts to optimize and improve the efficiency of our digital asset mining operations, we may be exposed to the risk in the future of losing the benefit of our capital investments and the competitive advantage we hope to gain from this as a result, and may be negatively impacted if a switch to proof-of-stake validation were to occur. Any such change to transaction validating protocols could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The further development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing transaction validation and the issuance of, and transactions in, digital assets are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stoppage of development or acceptance of blockchain networks and digital assets would have an adverse material effect on the successful development of the mining operation and value of earned digital assets.
The use of digital assets to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services, is part of a new and rapidly evolving industry that employs digital assets based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. The future of this industry is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of this industry include, but are not limited to:
•
continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of digital assets and blockchain technologies;
•
government and quasi-government regulation of digital assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operations of digital asset mining;
•
changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;
•
the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocols or similar digital asset systems;
•
the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, or trading assets including new means of using fiat currencies;
•
general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to digital assets; and
•
negative consumer perception of digital assets, including digital assets specifically and digital assets generally.
A decline in the popularity or acceptance of digital assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may not be able to obtain broad protection in the United States or internationally for all of our existing and future intellectual property and other proprietary rights, and we may not be able to obtain effective protection for our intellectual property and other proprietary rights in every country in which we operate. Protecting our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights may require significant expenditure of our financial, managerial and operational resources. Moreover, the steps that we may take to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate to protect such rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating such rights. Any of our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights, whether registered, unregistered, issued or unissued, may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative proceedings and/or litigation.
We may be required to spend significant resources to secure, maintain, monitor and protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights. Despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights. We may initiate claims, administrative proceedings and/or litigation against others for infringement, misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights to enforce and/or maintain the validity of such rights. Any such action, if initiated, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may infringe on third-party intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our commercial success depends on our ability to operate without infringing third-party intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights. For example, there may be issued patents of which we are not aware that our services or products infringe on. Also, there may be patents we believe we do not infringe on, but that we may ultimately be found to by a court of law or government 
21
Table of Contents
regulatory agency. Moreover, patent applications are in some cases maintained in secrecy until patents are issued. Because patents can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our services or products allegedly infringe on.
If a third party brings any claim against us based on third-party intellectual property rights and/or other proprietary rights, we will be required to spend significant resources to defend and challenge such claim, as well as to invalidate any such rights. Any such claim, if initiated against us, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our success is dependent on the ability of our management team and our ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain other well-qualified employees, which may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected.
Our success depends largely on the development and execution of our business strategy by our senior management team. We cannot assure you that our management will work well together, work well with our other existing employees or successfully execute our business strategy in the near-term or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled management and other employees. It is difficult to locate experienced executives in our industry. Further, competition for facility design, construction management, operations, data processing, engineering, IT, risk management and sales and marketing and other highly skilled personnel is extremely intense. We may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure at this stage in our development. We may be unable to attract and retain our senior executives and other key personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
A slowdown in market and economic conditions, particularly those impacting the cloud computing, machine learning and AI industries, the demand for HPC infrastructure and services, and the blockchain industry and the blockchain hosting market, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We and our customers are affected by general business and economic conditions in the United States and globally, particularly those impacting the cloud computing, machine learning and AI industries. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, money supply, political issues, legislative and regulatory changes, including the imposition of new tariffs affecting our or our customers’ products and services, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and broad trends in industry and finance, all of which are beyond our control. Macroeconomic conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the United States and the rest of the world could adversely affect our customers and vendors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business is heavily impacted by social, political, economic and other events and circumstances in the United States and in countries outside of the United States, most particularly Asian and other non-Western countries. 
Our business is heavily impacted by social, political, economic and other events and circumstances in the United States and in countries outside of the United States, most particularly in Asian and other non-Western countries. These events and circumstances are largely outside of our influence and control. We believe that nation states are actively mining bitcoin for their own treasuries, increasing network hash rate, reducing the Company’s share of network hash rate, and thereby reducing the Company’s revenue, profitability and financial results of operations. 
Global conflict could negatively impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial conditions.
Unforeseen global events, such as the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. These and similar conflicts, including any resulting sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions that may be imposed by the United States and/or other countries, have created global security concerns that could result in a regional conflict and otherwise have a lasting impact on regional and global economies, any or all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. To the extent that these conflicts have increased the global cost of energy and disrupted the demand for and price of bitcoin, it has and could continue to have an impact on our business. Sanctions, bans or other economic actions in response to conflicts could result in an increase in costs and disruptions to the Company. The extent of such items is not presently known, and any of them could negatively impact
 the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Changes in tariffs or import restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Much of the equipment necessary for HPC hosting and almost entirely all of the equipment necessary for digital asset mining is manufactured outside of the United States. There is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico, with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs and customs duties, and taxes. For example, since 2019, the U.S. government has implemented significant changes to U.S. trade policy with respect to China. These tariffs have subjected certain digital asset mining equipment manufactured overseas to additional import duties of up to 25%. The amount of the additional tariffs and the number of products subject to them has changed numerous times based on action by the U.S. government. These tariffs have increased costs of digital asset mining equipment, and new or additional tariffs or other restrictions on the import of equipment necessary for digital asset mining could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In the past, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and additional material weaknesses may occur in the future.
Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, we and our indepen
dent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting which were subsequently remediated. 
A material weakness is 
a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
If our 
internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, including the steps taken to remediate our prior material weaknesses, the reliability of our financial reporting, investor confidence, and the value of our securities could be materially and adversely affected. The failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of its financial statements, causing us to fail to meet its reporting obligations.
We may be required to record long-lived asset impairment charges, which could result in a significant charge to earnings. 
Under GAAP, we review our long-lived assets, such as fixed assets and intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. A significant portion of our total assets consists of fixed assets. Factors that may be considered in assessing whether long-lived assets may not be recoverable include reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our fixed assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded fixed assets. Our results of operations may be materially impacted if we are required to record a significant charge due to an impairment of our fixed assets. See financial statement Note 5 — Property, Plant and Equipment, Net and Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, for discussions of recently recognized impairments.
Losses relating to our business may be uninsured, or insurance may be limited.
Our hosting operations are subject to hazards and risks normally associated with the daily operations of facilities. Currently, we maintain various insurance policies for business interruption for lost profits, property and casualty, public liability, commercial employee, workers’ compensation, personal property and auto liability. Our business interruption insurance for lost profits includes coverage for business interruptions, our property and casualty insurance includes coverage for equipment breakdowns and our commercial employee insurance includes employee group insurance. We believe our insurance coverage adequately covers the risks of our daily business operations. However, our current insurance policies may be insufficient in the case of prolonged, catastrophic or certain other events. Further, the digital assets held by us are not insured. The occurrence of any event that is not entirely covered by our insurance policies may result in interruption of our operations, subject us to significant losses or liabilities and damage our reputation as a provider of business continuity services.
Risks Related to the Price of Bitcoin
Digital assets, and bitcoin in particular, are subject to price volatility. The value of bitcoin is dependent on a number of factors, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
23
Table of Contents
We currently generate 
almost all 
of our revenue from 
bitcoin rewards that we earn through self-mining in our facilities. Investing in bitcoin and other digital assets is speculative. Bitcoin and other digital assets have historically experienced significant intraday and long-term price volatility, significantly impacted by momentum pricing. Momentum pricing typically is associated with growth stocks and other assets whose valuation, as determined by the investing public, accounts for anticipated future appreciation in value. We believe that momentum pricing may have resulted, and may continue to result, in significant and rampant speculation regarding future appreciation (or depreciation) in the value of digital assets, inflating and making their market prices more volatile. In addition, there is currently growing but limited acceptance of digital assets in the retail and commercial marketplace, as compared to the demand generated by investors seeking a long-term value retention or by speculators seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of such digital assets, which may contribute to their levels of price volatility.
We believe the value of digital assets related to our business is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:
•
global digital asset supply;
•
global digital asset demand, which can be influenced by the growth of retail merchants’ and commercial businesses’ acceptance of digital assets as payment for goods and services, the security of online digital asset exchanges and digital wallets that hold digital assets, the perception that the use and holding of digital assets is safe and secure, transaction fees, and the regulatory restrictions on their use;
•
investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation of fiat currencies;
•
investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of deflation of digital assets;
•
cyber theft of digital assets from online wallet providers, or news of such theft from such providers or from individuals’ online wallets;
•
the availability and popularity of businesses that provide digital asset-related services;
•
fees associated with processing a digital asset transaction;
•
changes in the software, software requirements or hardware requirements underlying digital assets;
•
changes in the rights, obligations, incentives, or rewards for the various participants in digital asset mining;
•
interest rates;
•
currency exchange rates, including the rates at which digital assets may be exchanged for fiat currencies;
•
fiat currency withdrawal and deposit policies on digital asset exchanges and liquidity on such exchanges;
•
interruptions in service or failures of major digital asset exchanges;
•
investment and trading activities of large investors and holders, including private and registered funds, that may directly or indirectly invest in or hold digital assets;
•
momentum pricing;
•
monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations;
•
regulatory measures, if any, that affect the use of digital assets, restrict digital assets as a form of payment, or limit the purchase of digital assets;
•
global or regional political, economic or financial events and conditions;
•
expectations that the value of digital assets will change in the near or long term. A decrease in the price of a single digital asset may cause volatility in the entire digital asset industry and may affect other digital assets. For example, a security breach that affects investor or user confidence in bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin or another digital asset may affect the industry as a whole and may also cause the price of other digital assets to fluctuate; or 
•
with respect to bitcoin, increased competition from other forms of digital assets or payments services.
Even if shareholders are able to hold their securities for the long-term, their securities may never generate a profit, since digital asset markets have historically experienced extended periods of flat or declining prices, in addition to sharp fluctuations. Investors should be aware that bitcoin and other digital assets may not maintain their long-term value in terms of future purchasing power and that the acceptance of digital asset payments by mainstream retail merchants and commercial businesses may not continue to grow. If the price of bitcoin or other digital assets declines, our profitability will decline.

The
 “halving” of
 rewards available on the Bitcoin network, or the reduction of rewards on other networks, has had and in the future could have a negative impact on our ability to generate revenue as our customers may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and customers may cease mining operations altogether, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Under the current protocols governing the Bitcoin network, the reward for validating a new block on that network is cut in half from time to time, which has been referred to in our industry as the “halving.” When the Bitcoin network was first launched, the reward for validating a new block was 50 bitcoin. In 2012, the reward for validating a new block was reduced to 25 bitcoin. In July 2016, the reward for validating a new block was reduced to 12.5 bitcoin, and in May 2020, the reward was further reduced to 6.25 bitcoin. 
In April 2024, the Bitcoin protocol executed its fourth planned halving, wherein the bitcoin rewards issued for each solved block declined from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin. The next halving for the bitcoin blockchain is anticipated to occur sometime in 2028. In addition, other networks may operate under rules that, or may alter their rules to, limit the distribution of new digital assets. We, and to our knowledge, our potential hosting customers, currently rely on these rewards to generate a significant portion of our total revenue. If the award of digital assets for solving blocks and transaction fees are not sufficiently high, neither we nor our customers may have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease mining operations altogether, which as a result may significantly reduce demand for our hosting services. As a result, the halving of available rewards on the Bitcoin network, or any reduction of rewards on other networks, would have a negative impact on our revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If the award of bitcoin and/or transaction fees for solving blocks is not sufficiently high to incentivize transaction processors, such processors may reduce or cease expending processing power on a particular network, which could negatively impact the utility of the network, reduce the value of its bitcoin and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As the number of bitcoin rewarded to transaction processors for validating blocks in the Bitcoin network decreases, the incentive for transaction processors to continue contributing processing power to the network may shift toward transaction fees. Such a shift may increase the transaction fees on a network. Higher transaction fees may reduce the utility of a network for an end user, which may cause end users to reduce or stop their use of that network. Existing users may be motivated to switch from one digital asset to another or back to fiat currency. In such case, the price of the relevant digital asset may decline substantially and could go to zero. Such reduced price and demand for, and use of, the relevant digital asset and network, either as it applies to our mining services or to those of our potential hosting customers, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
To the extent that the profit margins of digital asset mining operations are not high, mining participants are more likely to sell their earned bitcoin, which could constrain bitcoin prices.
Over the past few years, digital asset mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, GPUs and first-generation ASIC servers. Currently, new processing power is predominantly added by incorporated and unincorporated “professionalized” mining operations. Professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated ASIC machines acquired from ASIC manufacturers. They require the investment of significant capital to acquire this hardware, to lease operating space (often in data centers or warehousing facilities), and to pay the costs of electricity and labor to operate the mining farms. As a result, professionalized mining operations are of a greater scale than prior mining operations and have more defined and regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized mining operations to maintain profit margins on the sale of digital assets. To the extent the price of digital assets decline and such profit margin is constrained, professionalized mining participants are incentivized to more immediately sell digital assets earned from mining operations, whereas it is believed that individual mining participants in past years were more likely to hold newly mined digital assets for more extended periods. The immediate selling of newly earned digital assets greatly increases the trading volume of the digital assets, creating downward pressure on the market price of digital asset rewards. The extent to which the value of digital assets earned by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the allocable capital and operating costs determines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized mining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly earned digital assets rapidly if it is operating at a low profit margin and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. In a low profit margin environment, a higher percentage could be sold more rapidly, thereby potentially depressing digital asset prices. Lower digital asset prices could result in further tightening of profit margins for professionalized mining operations creating a network effect that may further reduce the price of digital assets until mining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable forcing them to reduce mining power or cease mining operations temporarily. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of bitcoin and any other digital assets we earn through self-mining or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account.

Table of Contents
Mining operators may sell a substantial amount of digital assets into the market, which may exert downward pressure on the price of the applicable digital asset and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Mining requires the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of hardware, leasing or purchasing space, involves substantial electricity costs and requires the employment of personnel to operate the data facilities, which may lead mining operators to liquidate their positions in digital assets to fund these capital requirements. In addition, if the reward of new digital assets for mining declines, and/or if transaction fees are not sufficiently high, profit margins for mining operators may be reduced, and such operators may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of their digital assets.
Whereas it is believed that individual operators in past years were more likely to hold digital assets for more extended periods, the immediate selling of newly transacted digital assets by operators may increase the supply of such digital assets on the applicable exchange market, which could create downward pressure on the price of the digital assets and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The cash needs of our HPC hosting growth initiatives will limit the amount of digital assets we hold, thus preventing us from recognizing any gain from the appreciation in value of the digital assets we have sold and may sell in the future.
We are no longer required to sell our digital assets, including bitcoin, as we receive them under our existing debt agreements. However, the significant cash required by our expected HPC hosting growth initiatives will require us to sell the digital assets we earn periodically as cash needs and our treasury management policies dictate. When we sell a digital asset, we are unable to benefit from any future appreciation in the underlying value of that digital asset.
Consequently, our bitcoin may be sold at a time when the price is lower than it otherwise might be in the future, which could reduce the gain we might have realized on the sale of that digital asset at a different time.
Risks Related to our Limited Operating History
We operate in a rapidly developing industry and have an evolving business model with a limited history of generating revenue from our services. In addition, our evolving business model increases the complexity of our business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future business prospects and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business model has evolved in the past and continues to do so. After originally being founded in order to engage in the business of verifying and confirming transactions on a blockchain (also known as transaction processing, or “mining”), we have begun the provision of digital infrastructure colocation services to a third party engaged in high performance computing and have announced plans to convert most of our existing facilities to provide colocation services to other HPC customers. We have generated limited revenue from providing HPC services, and we do not know whether our change in business model will be  successful. To date, our revenue has primarily come from digital asset mining for our own account and digital asset mining hosting services. The evolution of and modifications to our business strategy will continue to increase the complexity of our business and have placed significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance and financial resources. Future additions to or modifications of our business strategy are likely to have similar effects. Further, any new services that we offer that are not favorably received by the market could damage our reputation or our brand. We may not ever generate sufficient revenues or achieve profitably in the future or have adequate working capital to meet our obligations.
We cannot be certain that our current business strategy or any new or revised business strategies will be successful or that we will successfully address the risks we face. In the event that we do not effectively evaluate future business prospects, successfully implement new strategies or adapt to our evolving industry, it will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may not be able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The businesses in which we currently operate and the HPC business in which we intend to grow are highly innovative, rapidly evolving and characterized by healthy competition, experimentation, frequent introductions of new products and services and uncertain and evolving industry and regulatory requirements. We expect competition to further intensify in the future as existing and new competitors introduce new products or enhance existing products. We compete against a number of companies operating both within the United States and abroad that have greater financial and other resources at their disposal . If we are unable to compete 
26
Table of Contents
successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take costly actions in response to the actions of our competitors, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
We compete with other bitcoin miners and with a range of hosting providers and blockchain providers for some or all of the services we offer. We face competition from numerous developers, owners and operators in the blockchain industry, including technology companies, such as hyperscale cloud players, managed service providers and real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), some of which own or lease properties similar to ours, or may do so in the future, in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. Cloud offerings may also influence our customers to move workloads to cloud providers, which may reduce the services they obtain from us. Our current and future competitors may vary from us in size, service offerings and geographic presence.
Competition is primarily centered on reputation and track record; design, size, quality, available power and geographic coverage of hosting space; quality of installation and customer equipment repair services; relationships with equipment manufacturers and ability to obtain replacement parts; technical and software expertise; and financial strength and price. Some of our current and future competitors may have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, stronger marketing, technical and financial resources and access to greater and less expensive power than we do. In addition, many companies in the industry are consolidating, which could further increase the market power of our competitors. Further, we also face significant competition from other users and/or companies that are processing transactions on one or more digital asset networks, as well as other potential financial vehicles, including securities, derivatives or futures backed by, or linked to, digital assets through entities similar to us, such as exchange-traded funds. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in digital assets directly. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and potentially the value of any digital assets we hold or expect to acquire for our own account.
We have experienced difficulties in establishing relationships with banks, leasing companies, insurance companies and other financial institutions to provide us with customary financial products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As an early stage company with operations focused in the digital asset mining industry, we have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, difficulties in establishing relationships with banks, leasing companies, insurance companies and other financial institutions to provide us with customary leasing and financial products and services, such as bank accounts, lines of credit, insurance and other related services, which are necessary for our operations. To the extent a significant portion of our business consists of digital asset transaction mining, processing or hosting, we may in the future continue to experience difficulty obtaining additional financial products and services on customary terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to Regulatory
 Framework

Our interactions with a blockchain may expose us to specially designated nationals (“SDN”) or blocked persons or cause us to violate provisions of law that did not contemplate distributed ledger technology.
The Office of Financial Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury (“OFAC”) requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons named on its SDN list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions, we may inadvertently engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC’s SDN list. Our internal policies prohibit any transactions with such SDN individuals, but we may not adequately determine the ultimate identity of the individual with whom we transact with respect to selling digital assets. In addition, in the future, OFAC or another regulator, may require us to screen transactions for OFAC addresses or other bad actors before including such transactions in a block, which may increase our compliance costs, decrease our anticipated transaction fees and lead to decreased traffic on our network. Any of these factors, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.
Moreover, federal law prohibits any U.S. person from knowingly or unknowingly possessing any visual depiction commonly known as child pornography. Recent media reports have suggested that persons have imbedded such depictions on one or more blockchains. Because our business requires us to download and retain one or more blockchains to effectuate our ongoing business, it is possible that such digital ledgers contain prohibited depictions without our knowledge or consent. To the extent government enforcement authorities literally enforce these and other laws and regulations that are impacted by decentralized distributed ledger technology, we may be subject to investigation, administrative or court proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties, all of which could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.

Table of Contents
If regulatory changes or interpretations of our activities require our registration as a money services business (“MSB”) under the regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, or otherwise under state laws, we may incur significant compliance costs, which could be substantial or cost-prohibitive. If we become subject to these regulations, our costs in complying with them may have a material negative effect on our business and the results of our operations.
To the extent that our activities cause us to be deemed an MSB under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, we may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate us to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records.
To the extent that our activities would cause us to be deemed a “money transmitter” (“MT”) or equivalent designation, under state law in any state in which we may operate, we may be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may include the implementation of anti-money laundering programs, maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements. For example, in August 2015, the New York State Department of Financial Services enacted the first U.S. regulatory framework for licensing participants in “virtual currency business activity.” The regulations, known as the “BitLicense,” are intended to focus on consumer protection and regulate the conduct of businesses that are involved in “virtual currencies” in New York or with New York customers and prohibit any person or entity involved in such activity to conduct activities without a license.
Such additional federal or state regulatory obligations may cause us to incur extraordinary expenses. Furthermore, we may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to MSBs and MTs. If we are deemed to be subject to and determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may act to dissolve and liquidate.
If we were deemed an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
An issuer will generally be deemed to be an “investment company” for purposes of the 1940 Act if:
•
it is an “orthodox” investment company because it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities; or
•
it is an inadvertent investment company because, absent an applicable exemption, it owns or proposes to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.
We believe that we are not and will not be primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, and we do not hold ourselves out as being engaged in those activities. We intend to hold ourselves out as a digital asset mining business. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are an “orthodox” investment company as described in the first bullet point above.
While certain digital assets may be deemed to be securities, we do not believe that certain other digital assets, in particular bitcoin, are securities; therefore, we believe that less than 40% of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis will comprise digital assets that could be considered investment securities. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are an inadvertent investment company by virtue of the 40% inadvertent investment company test as described in the second bullet point above. Although we do not believe any of the digital assets we may own, acquire, earn or mine are securities, there is still some regulatory uncertainty on the subject, see “—
There is no one unifying

principle governing the regulatory status of digital assets nor whether digital assets are securities in any particular context. Regulatory changes or actions in one or more countries may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of digital assets in a manner that adversely affects our business, prospects or operations
.” If certain digital assets, including bitcoin, were to be deemed securities, and consequently, investment securities by the SEC, we could be deemed an inadvertent investment company. Similarly, if we were to acquire digital assets deemed investment securities to hold for our own account or to engage in certain transactions, such as loan or repurchase transactions, we could be deemed an inadvertent investment company.
If we were to be deemed an inadvertent investment company, we may seek to rely on Rule 3a-2 under the 1940 Act, which allows an inadvertent investment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of (a) the date on which the issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the issuer’s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis or (b) the date on which the issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We are putting in place 
28
Table of Contents
policies that we expect will work to keep the investment securities held by us at less than 40% of our total assets, which may include acquiring assets with our cash, liquidating our investment securities or seeking no-action relief or exemptive relief from the SEC if we are unable to acquire sufficient assets or liquidate sufficient investment securities in a timely manner. As Rule 3a-2 is available to an issuer no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusion were available to us, we would have to keep within the 40% limit for at least three years after we cease being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit our ability to make certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on our earnings. In any event, we do not intend to become an investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities.
Finally, we believe we are not an investment company under Section 3(b)(1) of the 1940 Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business.
The 1940 Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operations of investment companies. Among other things, the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities, prohibit the issuance of stock options, and impose certain governance requirements. We intend to continue to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act. However, if anything were to happen that would cause us to be deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act, requirements imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure, ability to transact business with affiliates and ability to compensate key employees, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted, impair the agreements and arrangements between and among us and our senior management team and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Any change in the interpretive positions of the SEC or its staff with respect to digital asset mining firms could have a material adverse effect on us.
We intend to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Specifically, we do not believe that bitcoin, are securities. The SEC Staff has not provided guidance with respect to the treatment of these assets under the 1940 Act. To the extent the SEC Staff publishes new guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our strategy or assets accordingly. We may not be able to maintain our exclusion from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act. In addition, as a consequence of our seeking to avoid the need to register under the 1940 Act on an ongoing basis, we may be limited in our ability to engage in digital asset mining operations or otherwise make certain investments or engage in certain transactions, and these limitations could result in our holding assets we may wish to sell or selling assets we may wish to hold, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Recent developments have increased the likelihood that U.S. federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies will enact laws and regulations to regulate digital assets and digital asset intermediaries, such as digital asset exchanges and custodians.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 and continuing throughout 2022 and much of 2023, digital asset prices fell. This decline and other factors led to volatility and disruption in the digital asset markets and financial difficulties for several prominent industry participants, including digital asset trading platforms, hedge funds and lending platforms. Federal and state legislatures and regulatory agencies have already enacted and are expected to continue to introduce and enact new laws and regulations to regulate digital asset intermediaries, such as digital asset exchanges and custodians. The Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies (including the SEC, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), FinCEN, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation), among other regulators, as well as the White House, have issued reports and releases concerning digital assets, including bitcoin and digital asset markets. Most recently, in January 2025, the Acting SEC Chairman announced the launch of a crypto task force dedicated to developing a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto assets, in contrast to the SEC’s prior reliance on enforcement actions to regulate cryptocurrencies. However, the extent and content of any forthcoming laws and regulations are not yet ascertainable with certainty, and they may not be ascertainable in the near future. 
It is possible that new laws and increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny may require the Company to comply with certain regulatory regimes, which could result in new costs for the Company. In addition, new laws, regulations, and regulatory actions could significantly restrict or eliminate the market for, or uses of, digital assets including bitcoin, which could have a negative effect on the value of bitcoin, which in turn would have a negative effect on the value of the Company’s securities.

There is no one unifying principle governing the regulatory status of digital assets nor whether digital assets are securities in any particular context. Regulatory changes or actions in one or more countries may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of digital assets in a manner that adversely affects our business, prospects or operations.
As digital assets have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently, with certain governments deeming digital assets illegal, and others allowing their use and trade without restriction. In some jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., digital assets are subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear and evolving regulatory requirements. Bitcoin is the oldest and most well-known form of digital asset. Bitcoin and other forms of digital assets have been the source of much regulatory consternation, resulting in differing definitional outcomes without a single unifying statement. Bitcoin and other digital assets are viewed differently by different regulatory and standards setting organizations globally as well as in the United States on the federal and state levels. For example, the Financial Action Task Force considers a digital asset as currency or an asset, and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) considers a digital asset as property and not currency. Further, the IRS applies general tax principles that apply to property transactions to transactions involving virtual currency.
Furthermore, in the several applications to establish an exchange traded fund (“ETF”) of digital assets, and in the questions raised by the Staff under the 1940 Act, no clear principles emerge from the regulators as to how they view these issues and how to regulate digital assets under the applicable securities acts. It has been widely reported that the SEC has recently issued letters and requested various ETF applications be withdrawn because of concerns over liquidity and valuation and unanswered questions about absence of reporting and compliance procedures capable of being implemented under the current state of the markets for exchange traded funds. On April 20, 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bipartisan bill titled “Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act of 2021” (H.R. 1602). If passed by the Senate and enacted into law, the bipartisan bill would create a digital assets working group to evaluate the current legal and regulatory framework around digital assets in the United States and define when the SEC may have jurisdiction over a particular token or digital asset (i.e., when it is a security) and when the CFTC may have jurisdiction (i.e., when it is a commodity).
If regulatory changes or interpretations require the regulation of bitcoin or other digital assets under the securities laws of the United States or elsewhere, including the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and the 1940 Act or similar laws of other jurisdictions and interpretations by the SEC, the CFTC, the IRS, Department of Treasury or other agencies or authorities, we may be required to register and comply with such regulations, including at a federal, state or local level. To the extent that we decide to continue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary expense or burdens to us. We may also decide to cease certain operations and change our business model. Any disruption of our operations in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to us.
In addition, various foreign jurisdictions either have adopted or may adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect digital assets, digital asset networks and their users and hosting service providers that fall within such jurisdictions’ regulatory scope. Such laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of the United States, and may negatively impact the acceptance of digital assets by users, merchants and service providers outside of the United States and therefore impede the growth of digital asset use. A number of countries, including India, China, South Korea and Russia, among others, currently have a more restrictive or unclear stance toward digital assets and, thereby, have reduced the rate of expansion of digital asset use, as well as digital asset mining, in each of those countries. 
Regulatory actions may restrict the use of digital assets or the operation of digital asset networks or may impose additional regulatory burdens on our business. Changing enforcement policies and priorities have the potential to cause additional expenditures, restrictions, delays and strategic changes in connection with our business operations.
Laws and regulations may be subject to changes in enforcement policies or priorities, including changes that may result from changes in the political landscape and technologies. Recently, there has been a significant amount of regulatory attention directed toward digital assets, digital asset networks and other industry participants by United States federal and state governments, foreign governments and self-regulatory agencies. For example, as digital assets such as bitcoin have grown in popularity and in market size, the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies (e.g., FinCEN, the SEC, the CFTC and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) have begun to examine the operations of the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin users and Bitcoin exchange markets. In addition, state regulators such as the Texas State Securities Board, the Massachusetts Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities, the North Carolina Secretary of State’s Securities Division and the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation have initiated actions against, and investigations of, individuals and companies involved in digital assets.
Governments may in the future take regulatory actions that prohibit or severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell, use or trade digital assets or to exchange digital assets for fiat currency. Ownership of, holding or trading in digital assets may then be 
30
Table of Contents
considered illegal and subject to sanction. Governments may also take regulatory action that may increase the cost and/or subject digital asset mining companies to additional regulation.
By extension, similar actions by governments may result in the restriction of the acquisition, ownership, holding, selling, use or trading in the capital stock of digital asset mining companies, including our securities. Such a restriction could result in us liquidating our digital asset inventory at unfavorable prices and may adversely affect our shareholders. The effect of any regulatory change, either by federal, state, local or foreign governments or any self-regulatory agencies, on us or our potential hosting customers is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and may require us or our potential hosting customers to cease certain or all operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from government regulators, investors, lenders, customers, and other market participants with respect to our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks. 
Companies across all industries and around the globe are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies and disclosures. Regulators, investors, lenders, customers and other market participants are increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of investments. The increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital, as investors and lenders may reconsider their capital investment allocation as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices. If our ESG practices do not meet evolving regulator, investor, lender, customer or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards or if we do not adapt to or comply with regulator, investor, lender, customer or other industry shareholder expectations and standards, our reputation, ability to attract and/or retain employees, financial condition and/or share price could be negatively impacted. We may also incur additional costs if we do not adapt to or comply with stakeholder expectations about our electricity usage and other ESG concerns. Our failure or perceived failure to adapt to or comply with existing and potential government regulations, which are evolving but may relate to the suitable deployment of electric power, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG i
ssues, our reputation would suffer which would
 have similar negative impacts that could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
We may be subject to risks associated with misleading and/or fraudulent disclosure or use by the creators of digital assets.
Generally, we rely primarily on a combination of white papers and other disclosure documents prepared by the creators of applicable digital assets, as well as on our management’s ability to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential implications of transacting in these digital assets. However, such white papers and other disclosure documents and information may contain misleading and/or fraudulent statements (which may include statements concerning the creators’ ability to deliver in a timely fashion the product and/or service disclosed in their white papers and other disclosure documents) and/or may not reveal any unlawful activities by the creators. Recently, there has been an increasing number of investigations and lawsuits by the SEC and the CFTC involving digital asset creators for fraud and misappropriation, among other charges. Additionally, FinCEN has increased its enforcement efforts involving digital asset creators regarding compliance with anti-money laundering and Know-Your-Customer laws.
To the extent that any of these creators make misleading and/or fraudulent disclosures or do not comply with federal, state or foreign laws, or if we are unable to uncover all material information about these digital assets and/or their creators, we may not be able to make a fully informed business decision relating to our transacting in or otherwise involving such digital assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.
Our ability to comply with applicable complex and evolving laws, regulations, and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of our compliance, audit, and reporting systems, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. While we plan to devote significant resources to develop policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage our risks, we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective against all types of risks, including unidentified or unanticipated risks, or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed in all market environments.

Risks Related to Digital Assets
Digital assets exchanges and other trading venues are relatively new and, in some cases, unregulated and some have experienced fraud and failure.
To the extent that digital asset exchanges or other trading venues are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues, a reduction in digital asset prices could occur. Digital asset market prices depend, directly or indirectly, on the prices set on exchanges and other trading venues, which are new and, in most cases, largely unregulated as compared to established, regulated exchanges for securities, derivatives and other currencies. For example, during the past three years, a number of bitcoin exchanges have been closed due to fraud, business failure or security breaches. In many of these instances, the customers of the closed bitcoin exchanges were not compensated or made whole for the partial or complete losses of their account balances in such bitcoin exchanges. While smaller exchanges are less likely to have the infrastructure and capitalization that provide larger exchanges with additional stability, larger exchanges may be more likely to be appealing targets for hackers and “malware” (i.e., software used or programmed by attackers to disrupt computer operation, gather sensitive information, or gain access to private computer systems) and may be more likely to be targets of regulatory enforcement action.
Many digital asset exchanges currently do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, digital asset exchanges, which may cause the price of bitcoin to decline. For example, in the first half of 2022, each of Celsius Mining, LLC, Voyager Digital Ltd., and Three Arrows Capital Ltd. declared bankruptcy, resulting in a loss of confidence among participants in the digital asset ecosystem and negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly. In November 2022, BlockFi Inc. and FTX Trading Ltd (“FTX”), the third largest digital asset exchange by volume at the time, halted customer withdrawals, and, shortly thereafter, FTX and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy. Most recently, in January 2023, Genesis Global Holdco. LLC and certain affiliates filed for bankruptcy.
In response to these events, the digital asset markets, including the market for bitcoin specifically, have experienced price volatility and several other entities in the digital asset industry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected, further undermining confidence in the digital asset market and in bitcoin. These events have also negatively impacted the liquidity of the digital asset market as certain entities affiliated with FTX engaged in significant trading activity. If the liquidity of the digital asset market continues to be negatively impacted by these events, digital asset prices, including the price of bitcoin, may continue to experience significant volatility and confidence in the digital asset markets may be further undermined. A perceived lack of stability in the digital asset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to business failure, hackers or malware, government-mandated regulation, or fraud, may reduce confidence at least in part in digital asset networks and result in greater volatility in bitcoin’s value. Because the value of bitcoin is derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange government-issued currency that is designated as legal tender in its country of issuance through government decree, regulation, or law (“fiat” currency) for bitcoin, should the marketplace for bitcoin be jeopardized or disappear entirely, permanent and total loss of the value of bitcoin may result.
Digital asset transactions are irrevocable and, if incorrectly transferred, digital assets may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed digital asset transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Typically, digital asset transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the processing power on the applicable network. Once a transaction has been confirmed and verified in a block that is added to the network blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a digital asset or a theft of a digital asset generally will not be reversible and we may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft. Although transfers of any digital assets we hold will not regularly be made to or from vendors, consultants, services providers, etc., it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, digital assets held by us could be transferred from us in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties. To the extent that we are unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third party or are incapable of identifying the third party that has received our digital assets through error or theft, we will be unable to revert or otherwise recover our incorrectly transferred digital assets. To the extent that we are unable to seek redress for such error or theft, such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may not have adequate sources of recovery if the bitcoin held by us are lost, stolen or destroyed due to third-party digital asset services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Certain digital assets held by us are stored usi
ng Coinbase Global, Inc. (“Coinbase”), a
 third-party digital asset service. We believe that the security procedures that Coinbase utilizes, such as dual authentication security, secured facilities, segregated accounts 
32
Table of Contents
and cold storage, are reasonably designed to safeguard our bitcoin and other digital assets from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. Nevertheless, the security procedures cannot guarantee the prevention of any loss due to a security breach, software defect or act of God that may be borne by us. In addition, Coinbase’s limited liability under its services agreement with us may limit our ability to recover losses relating to our bitcoin. If such digital assets are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a third party liable to us, it is possible that the responsible third party may not have the financial resources or insurance sufficient to satisfy any or all of our claims against the third party, or have the ability to retrieve, restore or replace the lost, stolen or destroyed digital assets due to governing network protocols and the strength of the cryptographic systems associated with such digital assets. To the extent that we are unable to recover on any of our claims against any such third party, such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Any loss or destruction of a private key required to access a digital asset is irreversible. Loss of access to digital assets may be permanent.
Digital assets are each accessible and controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public key and private key associated with the digital asset. Although we utilize the services of third-party holders of digital assets and sell digital assets as soon as practicable after receiving them, it is possible that digital assets in our possession can be lost or stolen and irretrievable which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The digital assets held by us are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections.
We do not hold our digital assets with a banking institution or a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”), and to date, neither the FDIC nor the SIPC has extended any such protections to depositors of digital assets. Accordingly, our digital assets are not subject to the protections by FDIC or SIPC member institutions and any loss of our digital assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Digital assets, including bitcoin, face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times and any mechanisms of increasing the scale of digital asset settlement may significantly alter the competitive dynamics in the market.
Digital assets face significant scaling obstacles that can lead to high fees or slow transaction settlement times, and attempts to increase the volume of transactions may not be effective. Scaling digital assets, and particularly bitcoin, is essential to the widespread acceptance of digital assets as a means of payment, which is necessary to the growth and development of our business.
Many digital asset networks face significant scaling challenges. For example, digital assets are limited with respect to how many transactions can occur per second. In this respect, bitcoin may be particularly affected as it relies on the “proof-of-work” validation, which due to its inherent characteristics may be particularly hard to scale to allow simultaneous processing of multiple daily transactions by users. Participants in the digital asset ecosystem debate potential approaches to increasing the average number of transactions per second that the network can handle and have implemented mechanisms or are researching ways to increase scale, such as “sharding,” which is a term for a horizontal partition of data in a database or search engine, which would not require every single transaction to be included in every single miner’s or validator’s block.
There is no guarantee that any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale of settlement of digital asset transactions will be effective, how long they will take to become effective or whether such mechanisms will be effective for all digital assets. There is also a risk that any mechanisms of increasing the scale of digital asset settlements, such as the ongoing upgrades as part of Ethereum 2.0, may significantly alter the competitive dynamics in the digital asset market and may adversely affect the value of bitcoin and the price of our securities. Any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.
Latency in confirming transactions on a network could result in a loss of confidence in the network, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Latency in confirming transactions on a network can be caused by a number of factors, such as transaction processors ceasing to support the network and/or supporting a different network. To the extent that any transaction processors cease to record transactions on a network, such transactions will not be recorded on the blockchain of the network until a block is solved by a transaction processor that does not require the payment of transaction fees or other incentives. Currently, there are no known incentives for transaction processors to elect to exclude the recording of transactions in solved blocks. However, to the extent that any such incentives arise (for example, with respect to bitcoin, a collective movement among transaction processors or one or more mining pools forcing bitcoin users to pay transaction fees as a substitute for, or in addition to, the award of new bitcoin upon the solving of a block), transaction 
33
Table of Contents
processors could delay the recording and verification of a significant number of transactions on a network’s blockchain. If such latency became systemic, and sustained, it could result in greater exposure to double-spending transactions and a loss of confidence in the applicable network, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, increasing growth and popularity of digital assets, ICOs and security token offerings, as well as non-digital asset related applications that utilize blockchain technology on certain networks, can cause congestion and backlog, and as result, increase latency on such networks. An increase in congestion and backlogs could result in longer transaction confirmation times, an increase in unconfirmed transactions (that is, transactions that have yet to be included in a block on a network and therefore are not yet completed transactions), higher transaction fees and an overall decrease in confidence in a particular network, which could ultimately affect our ability to transact on that particular network and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Malicious actors or botnet may obtain control of more than 50% of the processing power on the bitcoin or other network.
If a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining on the bitcoin or other network, it may be able to alter the blockchain on which the bitcoin or other network and most bitcoin or other digital asset transactions rely by constructing fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner, or at all. The malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude, or modify the ordering of transactions, though it could not generate new bitcoin or digital assets or transactions using such control. The malicious actor could “double-spend” its own bitcoin or digital assets (i.e., spend the same bitcoin or digital assets in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other users’ transactions for so long as it maintained control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet did not yield its control of the processing power on the bitcoin or other network, or the bitcoin or other community did not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the blockchain may not be possible.
Although there are no known reports of malicious activity or control of the bitcoin blockchain achieved through controlling over 50% of the processing power on the network, it is believed that certain mining pools may have exceeded the 50% threshold. The possible crossing of the 50% threshold indicates a greater risk in that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of bitcoin transactions. To the extent that the Bitcoin or other digital asset ecosystems, including developers and administrators of mining pools, do not act to ensure greater decentralization of bitcoin or other digital asset mining processing power, the feasibility of a malicious actor obtaining control of the processing power on the bitcoin or other network will increase, which may adversely affect an investment in us.
Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of any or all networks.
Third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims relating to the operation of digital assets and the holding and transfer of such assets. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property rights claims or other legal action, any threatened action that reduces confidence in the long-term viability of any or all of the networks or other similar peer-to-peer networks, or in the ability of end-users to hold and transfer digital assets, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, a meritorious intellectual property rights claim could prevent us and other end-users from holding or transferring the digital assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
A soft or hard fork on a network could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The rules governing a network’s protocol are subject to constant change and, at any given time, there may be different groups of developers that can modify a network’s protocol. As network protocols are not sold and their use does not generate revenues for their development teams, the core developers are generally not compensated for maintaining and updating the network protocols. Consequently, there is a lack of financial incentive for developers to maintain or develop networks and the core developers may lack the resources to adequately address emerging issues with network protocols. Although the bitcoin and other leading networks are currently supported by core developers, such support may not continue or be sufficient in the future. To the extent that material issues arise with the bitcoin or another network protocol and the core developers and open-source contributors are unable to address the issues adequately or in a timely manner, the networks may be adversely affected.
Any individual can download the applicable network software and make any desired modifications that alter the protocols and software of the network, which are proposed to developers, users and transaction processors on the applicable network through software downloads and upgrades, typically posted to development forums such as GitHub.com. Such proposed modifications can be agreed upon, developed, adopted and implemented by a substantial majority of developers, transaction processors and users, which, in 
34
Table of Contents
such event, results in a “soft fork” or “hard fork” on the relevant network. A “soft fork” occurs when an updated version of the validating protocol is still “backwards compatible” with previous versions of the protocol. As a result, non-upgraded network participants with an older version of the validating protocol will still recognize new blocks or transactions and may be able to confirm and validate a transaction; however, the functionality of the non-upgraded network participant may be limited. Thus, non-upgraded network participants are incentivized to adopt the updated version of the protocol. The occurrence of a soft fork could potentially destabilize mining and increase transaction and development costs and decrease trustworthiness of a network.
A “hard fork” occurs when the updated version of the validating protocol is not “backwards compatible” with previous versions of the protocol, and therefore, requires forward adoption by network participants in order to recognize new blocks, validate and verify transactions and maintain consensus on the relevant blockchain. Since the updated version of the protocol is not backwards compatible, a hard fork can cause the relevant blockchain to permanently diverge into two separate blockchains on a network. For example, in the case of bitcoin, a hard fork created two new digital assets: Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. The value of a newly created digital asset from a hard fork (“forked digital asset”) may or may not have value in the long-run and may affect the price of other digital assets if interest and resources are shifted away from previously existing digital assets to the forked digital asset. The value of a previously existing digital asset after a hard fork is subject to many factors, including the market reaction and value of the forked digital asset and the occurrence of other soft or hard forks in the future. As such, the value of certain digital assets could be materially reduced if existing and future hard forks have a negative effect on their value.
If a soft fork or hard fork occurs on a network, which we or our hosting customers are processing transactions or hold digital assets in, we may be required to upgrade our hardware or software in order to continue our mining operations, and we may not be able to make such upgrades. A soft fork or hard fork in a particular digital asset that we process could have a negative effect on the value of that digital asset and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
To the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, transactions that do not include the payment of a transaction fee will not be recorded on the blockchain until a block is solved by a miner who does not require the payment of transaction fees. Any widespread delays in the recording of transactions could result in a loss of confidence in that digital asset network, which could adversely impact an investment in us.
To the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, such transactions will not be recorded on the blockchain. Currently, there are no known incentives for miners to elect to exclude the recording of transactions in solved blocks; however, to the extent that any such incentives arise (e.g., a collective movement among miners or one or more mining pools forcing bitcoin users to pay transaction fees as a substitute for or in addition to the award of new bitcoins upon the solving of a block), actions of miners solving a significant number of blocks could delay the recording and confirmation of transactions on the blockchain.
Any systemic delays in the recording and confirmation of transactions on the blockchain could result in greater exposure to double-spending transactions and a loss of confidence in certain or all digital asset networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.
Risks Related to our Indebtedness and Liquidity
We may incur additional indebtedness to execute our long-term growth strategy, which may reduce our profitability.
Our business requires significant capital, and we may require additional capital in the future to execute our growth strategy. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred approximately $95.0 million and $16.2 million in capital expenditures, respectively. Historically, we have financed these investments through cash flows from operation and external borrowings. These sources of capital may not be available to us in the future. Our ability to arrange new financing, either at the corporate level, a non-recourse project-level subsidiary or otherwise, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on numerous factors, including credit availability from banks and other financial institutions, investor confidence in us and the regional markets in which we operate, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings or our financial performance and level of indebtedness. Other companies with which we compete may have greater liquidity, more unencumbered assets, less indebtedness, greater access to credit and other financial resources, lower cost structures, more effective risk management policies and procedures, greater ability to incur losses, longer-standing relationships with customers, or greater flexibility in the timing of their sale of generation capacity and ancillary services than we do. If we are unable to fund capital expenditures for any reason, we may not be able to capture available growth opportunities and any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under the notes.

Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $1.12 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness for borrowed money. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:
•
increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;
•
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;
•
requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;
•
limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business;
•
diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion of the notes; and
•
placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital.
Our business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, including the notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.
We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the 2029 Convertible Notes or the 2031 Convertible Notes for cash following a fundamental change, the optional repurchase date, or during the free convertibility period, as applicable, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion of 2029 Convertible Notes or the 2031 Convertible Notes, and our other indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase 2029 Convertible Notes or the 2031 Convertible Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.
Holders of the $460.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Convertible Notes”), subject to a limited exception, may require us to repurchase their notes for cash following certain corporate events that constitute a “fundamental change” equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. From and after June 1, 2029, noteholders may convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before September 1, 2029. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election. 
Further, holders of the $625.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2031 (the “2031 Convertible Notes”), subject to a limited exception, may require us to repurchase their notes on December 15, 2027 or following certain corporate events that constitute a “fundamental change” at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the optional repurchase date or the fundamental change repurchase date, as applicable. From and after March 17, 2031, noteholders may convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before June 15, 2031. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election. 
Both the 2029 Convertible Notes and 2031 Convertible Notes might also be converted by noteholders based on certain triggering events based on the trading price of the Company’s common stock or the note, as applicable. 
We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the 2029 Convertible Notes or 2031 Convertible Notes or pay any cash amounts due upon conversion of the 2029 Convertible Notes or 2031 Convertible Notes. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our other indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the 2029 Convertible Notes or 2031 Convertible Notes or pay any cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase the 2029 Convertible Notes or 2031 Convertible Notes or pay any cash amounts due upon conversion when required under the indenture governing the 2029 Convertible Notes or the indenture governing the 2031 Convertible Notes, as applicable, will constitute a default under the applicable indenture. A default under either indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming

immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the other indebtedness, the 2029 Convertible Notes or the 2031 Convertible Notes. 
Provisions in our indentures could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us.
Certain provisions in the 2029 Convertible Notes or 2031 Convertible Notes, or any future notes, and the indentures governing these notes could make a third-party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then, except as described in this offering memorandum, noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the 2029 Convertible Notes or 2031 Convertible Notes, or any future notes, and the indentures governing these notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that noteholders or holders of our common stock may view as favorable.
The conditional conversion feature of the notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
In the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, noteholders will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more noteholders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if noteholders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.
The accounting method for the 2029 Convertible Notes and 2031 Convertible Notes, or any future notes, could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results.
The accounting method for reflecting the 2029 Convertible Notes or 2031 Convertible Notes, or any future notes, on our balance sheet, accruing amortized interest expense for these notes and reflecting the underlying shares of our common stock in our reported diluted earnings per share may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial condition.
Risks Related to Taxes
Our ability to use some or all of our net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future income may be limited.
As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $312.4 million and $128.1 million, respectively, U.S. federal and state capital loss carryforwards of approximately $220.7 million and $42.4 million, respectively, and certain other tax attributes, including disallowed business interest expense carryforwards under Section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Internal Revenue Code”), that could be utilized to offset future taxable income. The amount of our tax attributes are subject to examination and adjustment by applicable taxing authorities. Our federal NOLs can be carried forward indefinitely, our state NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2033 and our capital loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2027.
Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” its ability to utilize certain of its federal tax attributes (including NOL and capital loss carryforwards) to offset certain of its taxable income may be subject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally 5% shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). Similar rules may apply under applicable state tax law. 
Certain equity trading activity and other actions prior to the Effective Date of the Plan of Reorganization could have resulted in an ownership change for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code independent of the Plan of Reorganization, which could adversely affect our ability to utilize our tax attributes to a greater extent than an ownership change occurring as a result of the consummation of the Plan of Reorganization. In an attempt to minimize the likelihood of such an ownership change occurring, we obtained a final order from the Bankruptcy Court authorizing certain protective equity trading procedures.
37
Table of Contents
It is likely that we will undergo an ownership change under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code as a result of the consummation of the Plan of Reorganization, which may limit our ability to utilize our federal NOL and capital loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes, subject to the potential application of the special bankruptcy exception in Section 382(l)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code. We have not determined whether or not we would qualify for such special bankruptcy exception, and even if we did so qualify, whether or not we would elect out of such exception. Further, even if the consummation of the Plan of Reorganization does not cause an ownership change, it could increase the likelihood that we undergo such an ownership change in the future. 
Limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code (or applicable state tax law) on our ability to utilize our NOL or capital loss carryforwards or other tax attributes (whether by reason of an ownership change or otherwise) could significantly increase our future tax liabilities, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such tax attributes, which may impair the value of an investment in our securities.
The IRS and certain states have taken the position that digital assets are “property” for income tax purposes.
In early 2014, the IRS issued basic guidance on the tax treatment of digital assets. The IRS has taken the position that a digital asset is “property” instead of “currency” for income tax purposes. As such, general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to the acquisition, ownership, use, and disposition of digital assets. This overall treatment creates a potential tax liability for, and potential tax reporting requirements applicable to, us in any circumstance where we earn or otherwise acquire, mine, own, use, or dispose of a digital asset. In 2019, the IRS issued additional guidance specifically relating to the income tax consequences that could arise from a digital asset hard fork event in which a new unit of digital asset may or may not be received, and released frequently asked questions to address certain digital asset topics such as tax basis, gain, or loss on the sale or exchange of certain kinds of digital assets and how to determine the fair market value of such digital assets.

There is no guarantee that the IRS will not alter its position with respect to the taxation of digital assets, or that legislation or judicial determinations in the future will not result in a tax treatment of digital assets and transactions in digital assets for tax purposes that differs from the treatment described above. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor as to the tax implications of our acquisition, ownership, use, and disposition of digital assets. The taxation of digital assets for state, local, or non-U.S. tax purposes may not be the same as the taxation of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
In addition, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as of January 1, 2018, “like-kind exchange” treatment does not apply to digital assets. This means that gain from the sale or exchange of digital assets cannot be deferred by undertaking an exchange of one type of virtual currency for another.
Certain states, including New York and New Jersey, generally follow IRS guidance with respect to the treatment of digital assets for state income tax purposes, but it is unclear if other states will do so. Transactions involving digital assets for other goods and services may also be subject to sales and use or similar taxes under barter transaction treatment or otherwise. The treatment of digital assets for state income tax and sales tax purposes may have negative consequences, including the imposition of a greater tax burden on investors in digital assets or a higher cost with respect to the acquisition, ownership, use, and disposition of digital assets generally. In either case, this could have a negative effect on prices in the relevant digital asset exchange market and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Non-U.S. jurisdictions may also elect to treat digital assets in a manner that results in adverse tax consequences. To the extent a non-U.S. jurisdiction with a significant share of the market of digital asset owners or users imposes onerous tax burdens on such owners or users, or imposes sales, use, or value added tax on acquisitions and dispositions of digital assets for fiat currency, such actions could result in decreased demand for digital assets in such jurisdiction, which could impact the price of digital assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Changes to, or changes to interpretations of, the U.S. federal, state, local or other jurisdictional tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
All statements contained herein concerning U.S. federal income tax (or other tax) consequences are based on existing law and interpretations thereof. The tax regimes to which we are subject or under which we operate, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. While some of these changes could be beneficial, others could negatively affect our after-tax returns. In the future, the currently anticipated tax treatment may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative changes, possibly with retroactive effect. In addition, a tax authority or court may not agree with any particular interpretation of the relevant laws.

Table of Contents
State, local or other jurisdictions could impose, levy or otherwise enforce tax laws against us. Tax laws and regulations at the state and local levels frequently change, especially in relation to the interpretation of existing tax laws for new and emerging industries, and we cannot always reasonably predict the impact from, or the ultimate cost of compliance with, current or future taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Securities
An investment in our
 securities 
is highly speculative. The trading price of our securities may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
The trading price of our securities is likely to be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our securities as you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for those shares. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our securities include the following:
•
price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;
•
volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;
•
volatility in the price of bitcoin and other digital assets; 
•
changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;
•
sales of shares of our securities by us or our stockholders;
•
failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;
•
the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet those projections;
•
announcements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services;
•
the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;
•
rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;
•
actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;
•
actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;
•
litigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;
•
developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;
•
announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services or technologies by us or our competitors;
•
new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;
•
changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;
•
any significant change in our management; and
•
general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.
In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.
Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.
We may issue additional securities, including shares of New Common Stock as a result of the conversion or exercise, as applicable, of the New Warrants, options or restricted stock units (“RSUs”). In addition, the Company may choose to issue shares of New Common Stock pursuant to the CVRs. Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We may issue and sell New Common Stock, convertible securities, warrants and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any 
39
Table of Contents
such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our New Common Stock.
The market price and trading volume of our securities could decline if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business.
The trading market for our securities will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our securities or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our securities to decline.
We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their securities after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.
We no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company” as of December 31, 2024, and, as a result, we will no longer be able to avail ourselves of certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and/or smaller reporting companies.  
Based on the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of June 30, 2024, we ceased to qualify as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2024, and as such, we are no longer able to take advantage of any of the exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to emerging growth companies effective as of December 31, 2024.  We expect that the loss of our emerging growth company status and compliance with these additional requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs. In addition, any failure to comply with these additional requirements in a timely manner, or at all, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.
Risks Related to our Restructuring
Our actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our projections filed with the Bankruptcy Court or otherwise made public in the course of the Chapter 11 Cases
.
In connection with the Disclosure Statement and Plan of Reorganization that we filed with the Bankruptcy Court and the hearing to consider confirmation of our Plan of Reorganization (as well as in certain other filings), we prepared projected financial information for various reasons, including to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan of Reorganization and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from Chapter 11. Those projections were prepared solely for the purposes stated therein and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance with respect to then prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results may vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on those projections.
Upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, the composition of our Board of Directors changed significantly.
Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the composition of our Board of Directors changed significantly upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases. Our Board of Directors now includes members appointed by our prospective significant stockholders and significant holders of our debt. Our Board of Directors may change views on strategic initiatives and a range of issues that will determine our future. As a result, the future strategy and plans of ours may differ materially from those of the past. See Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for information regarding our Board of Directors and our key management members following emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.
The ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be affected by our emergence from bankruptcy.

The success of our business depends on key personnel. The ability to attract and retain these key personnel may be affected by our emergence from bankruptcy, the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. Any potential delays in adopting our management incentive plan and other executive benefits and compensation may make it difficult to retain key personnel and we may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.

Risk Management and Strategy
We are subject to various cybersecurity risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including intellectual property theft; fraud; extortion; harm to employees or customers; violation of privacy laws and other litigation and legal risk; and reputational risk. 
We have implemented a risk-based approach, guided by Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 199, to identify, classify, and appropriately assess the range of cybersecurity threats that could affect our business and information systems.
 Accordingly, security incidents are evaluated, classified by severity and prioritized for response, mitigation and remediation. From a high level, our incident response framework consists of five elements: (1) proactively identifying and appropriately managing cybersecurity risks to our systems, assets, data, and other capabilities; (2) designing and implementing the appropriate safeguards to timely deliver business services; (3) implementing systems and processes to detect the occurrence of cybersecurity events; (4) responding to events in a systematic and comprehensive fashion; and (5) utilizing mechanisms to promote system resilience and the restoration of critical business functions that may have been impaired due to a security incident.

Our cybersecurity program is aligned with industry standards and best practices, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework. Fundamentally, our information security program is tasked with developing pragmatic strategies for preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Company and customer information.  
Pursuant to this approach, we have implemented controls to prevent, detect and mitigate cybersecurity risks posed by third parties.
 We use various tools and methodologies, including a written incident response plan and cybersecurity insurance, to manage and mitigate cybersecurity risk. Those tools and methodologies are evaluated on a regular and continuing basis. We also monitor and evaluate our cybersecurity posture and performance on an ongoing basis through regular vulnerability scans, penetration tests and threat intelligence feeds. Through both short-term “game day” events and more prolonged campaigns, red team programming is designed to continuously stress test the fortitude of our information security systems and assist in identifying areas of potential vulnerability. Based on the results of these simulated exercises, we aim to harden any identified exposure points and adjust our security processes to ensure dynamism and responsiveness. 
Along with our in-house cybersecurity capabilities, we also periodically engage third parties to assist with detecting and responding to cybersecurity risks. Third parties may be engaged to assist with procedures including red and blue team training exercises and penetration testing. We require third-party service providers with access to personal, confidential or proprietary information to implement and maintain comprehensive cybersecurity practices consistent with applicable legal standards and industry best practices.
 Amongst other controls, we maintain policies and practices that monitor, regulate and limit remote access of our information systems.
Our business depends on the availability, reliability, and security of our information systems, networks, data, and intellectual property. Any disruption, compromise, or breach of our systems or data due to a cybersecurity threat or incident could adversely affect our operations, customer service, product development, and competitive position. They may also result in a breach of our contractual obligations or legal duties to protect the privacy and confidentiality of our stakeholders. Such a breach could expose us to business interruption, lost revenue, ransom payments, remediation costs, liabilities to affected parties, cybersecurity protection costs, lost assets, litigation, regulatory scrutiny and actions, reputational harm, customer dissatisfaction, harm to our vendor relationships, or loss of market share. 
To date, we have not identified any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have, or are likely to, materially affect us, our business strategy, results of operation or financial condition.
 For more information on the risks from cybersecurity threats that we face, refer to Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including but not limited to the risk factors titled, “
We may be vulnerable to both physical and cybersecurity breaches, which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations”

Governance
Our 
information security team
 is led by our Chief Information Security Officer and is comprised of dedicated professionals responsible for overseeing cybersecurity risk management and mitigation, incident prevention, detection and remediation.

These teams are spearheaded by professionals with decades of cybersecurity leadership experience across multiple industries, including our Chief Technology Officer.
 Our leadership working group meets on a weekly basis to discuss our approach to the rapidly-evolving cybersecurity landscape. To ensure that our top-level strategy is disseminated throughout the Company, our information security team provides hands-on and often role-specific training and awareness programs to our employees. Our employees with network access participate annually in required training, including spear phishing and other awareness training. We also periodically conduct simulated phishing exercises to practice appropriate response and augment employee awareness of established and emerging cyber threats.
One of the key functions of our Board of Directors is informed oversight of our risk management process, including cybersecurity risk. Our Board of Directors considers cybersecurity risk and mitigation as a critical component of its risk oversight function and intends to further develop specific cybersecurity oversight functions and protocols. 
Our Board of Directors administers this oversight function directly through the Board of Directors as a whole, as well as through various standing committees of our Board of Directors, including the Audit Committee, that address risks inherent in their respective areas of oversight.
 In particular, our Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure and our Audit Committee has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. The Audit Committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and is charged with oversight of the adequacy of Company’s insurance programs, including cyber insurance.
