Item 2. Properties.
Our corporate headquarters is located at 838 Walker Road, Suite 21-2105, Dover, Delaware 19904. In addition, we earn bitcoin through mining for our own account and for third-party hosting customers at our owned and leased facilities in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, North Dakota, and Texas. We lease with an option to purchase at a nominal amount our facility in North Dakota. We also own property in Oklahoma where our facility is in development to support artificial intelligence-related workloads. We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current and anticipated near-term needs. Please refer to the discussions contained in our Item 1. – “Business” for additional information.
