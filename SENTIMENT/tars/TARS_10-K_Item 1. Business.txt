Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics, starting with eye care. We launched XDEMVY
®
 (lotilaner ophthalmic solution) 0.25%, formerly known as TP-03, for the treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis, in August 2023 after receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approval in July 2023. 
Demodex
 blepharitis is caused by the infestation of 
Demodex
 mites. Blepharitis ("Blephar" is a reference to eyelid and "itis" is a reference to inflammation) is an ophthalmic lid margin disease characterized by inflammation of the eyelid margin, redness and ocular irritation, including a specific type of eyelash dandruff called collarettes, which are pathognomonic for 
Demodex
 blepharitis. Chronic and progressive blepharitis can lead to corneal damage over time and, in extreme cases, blindness. There may be as many as approximately 25 million people in the U.S. who suffer from 
Demodex
 blepharitis. XDEMVY is the first and only therapeutic approved by the FDA and we believe is the definitive standard of care for the treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis.
XDEMVY targets and eradicates the root cause of 
Demodex
 blepharitis — 
Demodex
 mite infestation. The active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") of XDEMVY, lotilaner, paralyzes and eradicates mites and other parasites through the inhibition of parasite-specific gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride ("GABA-Cl") channels with no GABA-Cl inhibition in humans.
To date, we have completed seven clinical trials that include a Phase 3 trial (the "Saturn-2 trial"), a Phase 2b/3 trial (the "Saturn-1 trial"), four Phase 2 trials, and a Phase 1 trial (the "Hyperion trial") for XDEMVY in 
Demodex
 blepharitis, all of which met their primary, secondary and/or certain exploratory endpoints, with the drug generally safe and well tolerated throughout each trial. We have also completed, and/or have ongoing clinical trials for the potential treatment of 
Demodex 
blepharitis in patients with Meibomian Gland Disease ("MGD"), including a Phase 2a clinical trial (the "Ersa trial") that evaluated XDEMVY for the treatment of MGD in patients with 
Demodex 
blepharitis, and a pilot clinical trial that evaluated an XDEMVY vehicle for the potential treatment of MGD in patients with 
Demodex 
mites (the "Rhea trial"), TP-04 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea, and TP-05 for potential Lyme disease prophylaxis, among others.
We intend to further advance our pipeline with the lotilaner API to address several diseases in human medicine, including eye care and infectious disease prevention. We are investigating the development of our product candidates to address targeted diseases with high unmet medical needs, which currently include TP-04, a novel ophthalmic gel formulation of lotilaner for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea, and TP-05, a novel investigational oral formulation of lotilaner, for potential Lyme disease prophylaxis and community malaria reduction.
TP-03 Demodex blepharitis in patients with Meibomian Gland Disease (MGD)
MGD is commonly characterized by functional and structural dysfunction of the meibomian glands within the eyelid margin, which then results in blockage and/or thickened and decreased production of meibum. If left untreated, MGD can lead to permanent changes to the tear film and progressive gland loss. Approximately 30-40 million Americans are impacted by MGD. Currently, there are no FDA-approved pharmacologic therapies for MGD patients without 
Demodex
 blepharitis. 
Demodex
 mites are key contributors to MGD in patients with 
Demodex
 blepharitis, causing eyelid inflammation and reduced meibomian gland function.
In August 2022, we announced the enrollment of our first patient in the Ersa trial. In December 2023, we announced positive topline results from the Ersa trial evaluating XDEMVY administered twice daily ("BID") or three times a day ("TID") for six weeks and twelve weeks. XDEMVY demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements compared to baseline in two objective measures of the disease: the presence and quality of liquid secretion as measured by the Meibomian Gland Secretion Score; and the number of glands secreting normal or clear liquid. In November 2024, additional positive data was presented from the Ersa trial as well as data from the Rhea trial, at the American Academy of Optometry ("AAOpt") Annual Meeting 2024. The Rhea trial enrolled a similar patient population as the Ersa trial, and evaluated the same outcomes, with the same dosing regimens with XDEMVY vehicle. Both the Ersa and Rhea trials also assessed patient reported outcomes for some of the most commonly reported patient symptoms in 
Demodex
 blepharitis and MGD, namely fluctuating vision, itching, redness, and burning.
The combined data from the Ersa and Rhea trials showed in a pooled analysis presented at the AAOpt Annual Meeting 2024 that XDEMVY could be the first pharmacologic treatment for MGD in patients with 
Demodex
 blepharitis to 
5
demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements from baseline, as well as when compared to XDEMVY vehicle. These improvements were shown across three objective measures of MGD: (i) the presence and quality of liquid secretion as measured by the Meibomian Gland Secretion Score; (ii) the number of glands secreting normal or clear liquid; and (iii) the number of glands yielding any liquid. Improvements were also demonstrated across some of the most reported patient outcomes, including fluctuating vision, itching and redness. Further, XDEMVY demonstrated statistically significant rates of collarette cure and lid margin erythema cure that are consistent with previous XDEMVY studies. No statistically significant differences were observed between the BID and TID treatment arms in both the Ersa and Rhea trials, respectively, and XDEMVY and the XDEMVY vehicle were well tolerated. Given the positive results of these trials, and the FDA’s feedback that these patients are already included in XDEMVY’s label for the treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis, we are moving forward with sharing this data with eye care providers ("ECPs") to further educate them on the disease and the potential benefits of treating these patients with XDEMVY.
TP-04 for the Potential Treatment of Ocular Rosacea
We are exploring the therapeutic potential of TP-04 as a novel topical ophthalmic gel formulation of lotilaner for the treatment of Ocular Rosacea, a chronic eyelid disease characterized by redness, flushing and inflammation of the eyelid margin, visible blood vessels, and surrounding peri-ocular skin. Ocular Rosacea, like 
Demodex
 blepharitis, is believed to be caused by 
Demodex
 mites. Approximately 15-18 million Americans are impacted by Ocular Rosacea and there are currently no FDA-approved therapeutics to treat this disease.
TP-04 is designed to eradicate 
Demodex
 mites, a potential root cause of Ocular Rosacea. In March 2023, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 1 Galatea trial (the "Galatea Phase 1 trial”) and initiated a Phase 2a trial (the "Galatea trial") for the potential treatment of rosacea. The Galatea trial was a multicenter, randomized, vehicle-controlled trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of TP-04. In February 2024, we announced positive topline results from the Galatea trial which demonstrated statistically significant improvements (p<0.05) in inflammatory lesions and Investigator's Global Assessment ("IGA") score (change in baseline and success rate) compared to vehicle at Week 12. After review of this data with the FDA and Key Opinion Leaders ("KOLs"), we decided to pursue development of TP-04 for the potential treatment for Ocular Rosacea. In January 2025, we announced plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial in the second half of 2025 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea.
TP-05 for the Potential Prevention of Lyme Disease
We are exploring the therapeutic potential of TP-05 as an oral, systematic prophylactic for Lyme disease designed to eradicate the tick before it can transmit the 
Borrelia burgdorferi
 infection that causes Lyme disease. There are approximately 80 million people in the U.S. at risk of Lyme disease exposure with nearly 30 million of which are moderate to high risk. Further, there are approximately 400,000 reported cases of Lyme disease in the U.S. each year, but it is believed that the actual number of cases could be much higher.
Lyme disease can potentially cause severe, often debilitating symptoms with permanent and irreversible damage. The disease can result in inflammation, nerve, joint and muscle pain or swelling, numbness, shortness of breath and, in severe cases, neurological complications such as facial palsy, vision issues and meningitis, including severe headaches and neck stiffness. Lyme disease can often go undetected and untreated because the ticks are not always noticed before they transmit the disease. People who are in high-risk areas and/or spend extended amounts of time outdoors in wooded, grassy areas are at higher risk of contracting the infection. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") show that the risk of Lyme disease is spreading to new geographic areas, resulting in a significant need for prophylactic solutions.
Currently, there are no FDA-approved pharmacological prophylactic options for Lyme disease. We believe TP-05 is currently the only non-vaccine, drug-based, preventive therapeutic in clinical development that targets the ticks, and potentially prevents Lyme disease transmission. It is designed to rapidly provide systemic blood levels of lotilaner, a well-characterized anti-parasitic agent that paralyzes and kills infected ticks attached to the human body through selective targeting of parasite-specific GABA-CI channels, before they can transmit the 
Borrelia burgdorferi
 infection.
In December 2022, we announced positive topline results from the completed Phase 1 Callisto trial (the "Callisto trial") and enrollment of the first patient in the Phase 2a clinical trial (the "Carpo trial"). The Carpo trial was designed to evaluate TP-05, for the potential prevention of Lyme disease in humans. The Carpo trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of TP-05 in killing lab grown, non-disease carrying ticks after they have attached to the skin of healthy volunteers, as well as confirm the safety, tolerability, and blood concentration of TP-05. Sterile, non-pathogenic nymphal ticks were placed on the skin of healthy human volunteers at two separate instances (one day prior to dosing and 30 days after dosing). Tick mortality was evaluated within 24 hours of attachment after each placement. In most 
6
cases, ticks must be attached for 36-48 hours or more before Lyme disease can be transmitted, so killing ticks within 24 hours of attachment can greatly increase the probability of disease prevention.
In February 2024, we announced positive topline results from the Carpo trial which demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in killing ticks compared to vehicle (p < 0.0001). Specifically, after the Day 1 tick challenge, mean tick mortality was 97.0% (± 1.4 standard error, SE) and 92.0% (± 6.3 SE) for the high and low doses of TP-05, respectively, compared to only 5.0% (± 2.5 SE) for placebo. Similarly, at the 30-day challenge, mean tick mortality at 24 hours after placement was 89.0% (± 11.1 SE) and 91.0% (± 6.1 SE) for the high and low doses of TP-05, respectively, compared to only 9.0% (± 8.0 SE) for placebo (p<0.001). No statistically significant differences in tick mortality were observed between the two TP-05 treatment arms, and TP-05 was generally well tolerated.
In December 2024, we met with the FDA about our Lyme disease program. The FDA agreed to our proposed approach for a Phase 2b clinical trial, which plans to include several hundred subjects. Additionally, the FDA confirmed that a Phase 3 clinical study would require a disease prevention field study that would likely require the enrollment of thousands of patients. We continue to believe that the best approach to potentially deliver this potential prophylactic therapy to patients is to enter into discussions to partner this program either prior to the initiation of the Phase 2b study or after the completion of the study.
The following chart presents our wholly owned product candidates and clinical development status:
Our Strategy
Our ambition is to become a leader in eye care. We have been intentional about charting a new course in eye care that is grounded in addressing the root cause of disease and we intend to achieve this ambition by pursuing the following key strategic objectives:
•
Continue to accelerate the launch trajectory of our first marketed product, XDEMVY
. We launched XDEMVY for the treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis in August 2023 after receiving FDA approval in July 2023. XDEMVY has delivered remarkable results for patients and ECPs, and offers a compelling value proposition for payers.
•
Continue to pursue a potentially transformative opportunity in Ocular Rosacea.
 OR is our next opportunity to create another potential blockbuster market in eye care. Ocular Rosacea is another common 
7
eye disease that has been underdiagnosed and undertreated for years because there are no FDA-approved therapeutics. In January 2025, we announced plans to initiate a Phase 2 study in the second half of 2025.
•
Continue to advance and expand our pipeline, bringing novel products utilizing lotilaner to unmet needs across human medicine, including Lyme disease prophylaxis.
 The mechanism of lotilaner coupled with our insights into disease where it can demonstrate clinical benefit, provides an opportunity to expand into new indications for treatment or prevention. In December 2024, we met with the FDA about our Lyme disease prevention program. The FDA agreed to our proposed approach for a Phase 2b clinical trial, which would include several hundred subjects. We continue to believe that the best approach to potentially deliver this potential prophylactic therapy to patients is to enter into discussions to partner this program either prior to the initiation of the Phase 2b study or after the completion of the study.
•
Evaluate and strategically enter collaborations to maximize the potential of our pipeline and the scope of our eye care product offerings.
 Apart from the development and license agreement (the "China Out-License") with Xi An Grand Chang An Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ("GrandPharma") of TP-03 for the potential treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis and MGD within the China Territory, as described below within
 License Agreements: GrandPharma Agreement
, we have retained our rights globally to all of our indications for use in humans, including for XDEMVY for the treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis, TP-04 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea and TP-05 for potential Lyme disease prophylaxis and community malaria reduction. Given the potential to treat patients worldwide we may opportunistically enter into additional strategic collaborations around certain product candidates, disease and/or geographic regions.
•
Continue innovating and planning for growth.
 We have assembled an exceptional management team with decades of deep and expansive strategic expertise building new markets across eye care and biotechnology. This team, coupled with their strong execution capabilities and financial discipline will potentially enable further innovation and growth.
Additional Potential Growth Drivers in 2025 and Beyond
We are on track for potential European regulatory approval of a preservative-free formulation of XDEMVY for the potential treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis in 2027. We have initiated market development work, including Key Opinion Leader engagement, disease education and scientific presentations at major conferences. 
In Japan, we expect to share results from a 
Demodex
 blepharitis prevalence study in the first half of 2025 and meet with Japanese regulatory authorities to help determine a regulatory path forward. 
The Chinese regulatory agency, National Medical Products Administration, accepted the New Drug Application ("NDA") submitted by our partner, Grand Pharmaceutical Group Ltd., for TP-03 for 
Demodex
 blepharitis.
Commercial Strategy for 
Demodex
 Blepharitis
In August 2023 we launched XDEMVY in the U.S. with a specialty sales force, social and digital media, and ECP education campaigns and targeted prescribing ophthalmologists and optometrists. 
During 2024, we continued to work with KOLs and various associations to increase 
Demodex
 blepharitis awareness and education, and we have highlighted prevalence, impact, and simplicity of diagnosis of 
Demodex
 blepharitis. Our goal is to continue to educate ECPs about the prevalence of 
Demodex
 blepharitis, simplicity and efficiency of diagnosis, and the positive profile of XDEMVY. Consistent with our goal to educate ECPs, we expanded our sales force by approximately 50 new representatives and leaders in 2024. In addition to educating ECPs, we activated our first Direct-to-Consumer ("DTC") campaign in streaming television in the fourth quarter of 2024 that leverages creative and memorable visuals to illustrate the damaging impact of the disease, with the goal of supporting patients in their journey and encouraging them to consult with ECPs to see whether XDEMVY is right for them.
In 2024, the first full year XDEMVY was available on the market, XDEMVY generated $180.1 million in net product sales, more than 163,000 bottles were dispensed to patients, and we secured broad commercial and Medicare coverage. The success of XDEMVY was built on a very core set of fundamentals and a reflection of our strategic approach to an unwavering focus on evidence generation, education, ease of access and execution, which we believe will drive continued success in 2025 and beyond.

Blepharitis: Market Overview
Blepharitis is a common, chronic ophthalmic lid margin disease characterized by inflammation of the eyelid margin, redness and ocular irritation. It is also a progressive disease that often manifests with more severe symptoms if left untreated, such as blurring of vision, missing eyelashes, MGD, corneal damage and potentially, in extreme cases, blindness. 
Demodex
 blepharitis may affect approximately 25 million Americans based on an extrapolation from the Titan study (as defined below) indicating 58% of patients presenting to U.S. eye care clinics have collarettes, a pathognomonic sign of 
Demodex
 infestation, and that at least 45 million people annually visit an eye care clinic. In addition, there is growing awareness among ECPs of the pathognomonic sign of 
Demodex
 infestation, called collarettes or cylindrical dandruff, which is a specific type of debris found at the base of the eyelashes. Collarettes are composed of partially digested epithelial cells, mite waste products and eggs among other things and can be easily diagnosed by ECPs as part of a standard eye examination. The prevalence of 
Demodex
 blepharitis increases progressively with aging, which is one main risk factor for the disease, though other frequently presenting patients can also suffer from dry eye, contact lens intolerance, and cataracts. These patients commonly present to the offices of ECPs for other ophthalmic diseases besides blepharitis, such as cataract surgery evaluation and contact lens discomfort. Accordingly, we believe that there is significant opportunity to increase the diagnosis rate of 
Demodex
 blepharitis through ECP and patient education that encourages examination of the disease in standard practice.
Despite the high prevalence of patients with 
Demodex
 blepharitis and growing awareness of the disease among ECPs, there were no FDA-approved therapeutics for the treatment of blepharitis, let alone 
Demodex
 blepharitis, until XDEMVY was approved in July 2023. Although we believe blepharitis and
 Demodex
 blepharitis are significantly under-diagnosed diseases with limited treatment alternatives, there are already approximately 1.5 million 
Demodex
 blepharitis diagnoses in the U.S. based on findings from the Titan study and data that show blepharitis classified per the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification ("ICD-10-CM"). 
We have conducted epidemiology and market research on the prevalence of blepharitis and potential adoption of XDEMVY. Our research indicates approximately 58% of patients presenting to ECP offices have collarettes and, based on the Gao et al 2005 study (the "Gao study"), all patients with collarettes were also found to have 
Demodex
 mites. In addition, our market research suggests the potential for a high level of adoption of XDEMVY. We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase the diagnosis rate of 
Demodex
 blepharitis and build a significant new market with XDEMVY, a therapy that addresses the underlying root cause of the disease.
Further, patients continue to have underlying risk of 
Demodex
 infestation, as there could be a recurrence or reinfestation based on the presence of 
Demodex
 mites in the facial pores even after eradication of 
Demodex
 mites from the eyelid, that may potentially necessitate retreatment. The Saturn-2 trial enrolled 412 adults having, among other things, more than ten collarettes per lid and at least mild lid erythema. All pre-specified primary and secondary endpoints were met, XDEMVY was well tolerated, and improvement in lids (reduction of collarettes to no more than 2 collarettes per upper lid) was demonstrated in 55% of patients treated with XDEMVY. The Saturn-1 trial enrolled 421 adult patients having more than ten collarettes on the upper lid and at least mild erythema of the upper eyelid margin. The Saturn-1 trial results showed the pre-specified primary and secondary endpoints were met, and improvement in lids (reduction of collarettes to no more than 2 collarettes per upper lid) was demonstrated in 44% of patients treated with XDEMVY by day 43.
Blepharitis Overview
Blepharitis
Blepharitis is a common, chronic ophthalmic lid margin disease, which may lead to or exacerbate ocular surface disease. Blepharitis is primarily diagnosed and treated by ECPs, including ophthalmologists and optometrists. Typical signs and symptoms of blepharitis include debris on the eyelashes, redness of the eye and eyelid, missing or misdirected eyelashes, blurring of vision, irritation, lid itchiness and ocular discomfort. Blepharitis can be challenging to manage, recurs frequently, and its progression can lead to scarring of the eyelid, loss of proper eyelid and tear-film function, eyelid and lash abnormalities, inflammation of the conjunctiva and surrounding skin, MGD, suboptimal surgical outcomes, corneal damage, and potentially in extreme cases, blindness. 
Multiple factors can cause blepharitis, including infestation by 
Demodex
 mites, bacterial infection, clogging of the meibomian glands and seborrheic dermatitis.
The following images illustrate representative eyelids with 
Demodex
 blepharitis demonstrating the characteristic sign of collarettes:

Figure 2: Eyelids With 
Demodex 
Blepharitis
Demodex Blepharitis
Demodex
 infestation is a major cause of blepharitis, and we estimate that the number of 
Demodex
 blepharitis patients in the U.S. may be as many as approximately 25 million. Although we believe blepharitis and
 Demodex
 blepharitis are significantly under-diagnosed diseases, with limited treatment options, there are already an estimated 1.5 million 
Demodex
 blepharitis diagnoses in the U.S. based on the Titan study and coding for blepharitis classified per the ICD-10-CM. 
Demodex
 mites are the most common ectoparasite found on humans and are more likely to cause infestation and disease with aging. 
Demodex
 blepharitis typically presents bilaterally in patients with the disease. There are two species of 
Demodex
 mites, 
folliculorum
 and 
brevis
, that live on the skin of the face and eyelids. 
Demodex

folliculorum,
 which is commonly found in the follicle, is the more common sub-species of mite that causes 
Demodex
 blepharitis.
The pathognomonic sign of 
Demodex
 blepharitis is a specific type of eyelid debris known as the collarette, which is also sometimes referred to as cylindrical dandruff, sleeves, or waxy scurf. Collarettes are composed of partially digested epithelial cells, mite waste products and eggs among other things and can be easily diagnosed by ECPs with a standard eye examination known as the slit lamp examination. Other bothersome signs and symptoms of
 Demodex
 blepharitis that can lead to further disease progression include missing or misdirected eyelashes, crusting, redness of the lid margin, inflammation of the lid margin, inflammation of the conjunctiva and/or inflammation of the cornea, also known as blepharoconjunctivitis and blepharokeratitis. 
Demodex
 blepharitis is a progressive disease that often manifests with more severe signs and symptoms if left untreated, such as blurring of vision, missing eyelashes, MGD, corneal damage and potentially, in extreme cases, blindness. Furthermore, 
Demodex
 blepharitis can negatively impact daily activities and create an emotional burden for individuals with the disease. According to studies we have conducted, approximately 56% of cataract patients have 
Demodex
 infestation, which may increase the risk for infection after cataract and refractive surgery. Therefore, treating 
Demodex
 blepharitis may potentially improve patient satisfaction with cataract and refractive surgery. Additionally, the primary reason people stop wearing contact lenses is due to discomfort; blepharitis has been shown to cause contact lens intolerance. Therefore, treating 
Demodex
 blepharitis may reduce contact lens intolerance. We believe these benefits may lead to better vision and improved activities of daily living for patients.
10
The following figures illustrate how 
Demodex folliculorum
 mites enter and reside in the eyelash follicles:
Figure 3:

Demodex folliculorum

Mites Entering and Residing in Eyelash Follicles
Demodex
 infestation can lead to 
Demodex
 blepharitis in three main ways:
1)
Mechanical:
 Overcrowded mites scrape the epithelial cell lining of the eyelash follicles with their claws and lay eggs, causing follicular distention, misdirected lashes, eyelash loss and irritation. Dead mites and collarettes also obstruct the hair follicle opening, leading to inflammation.
2)
Chemical:
 Mites excrete digestive enzymes as they feed and exude digestive waste when they die, resulting in inflammation, redness, irritation and epithelial hyperplasia.
3)
Bacterial:
 Bacteria living on the mite surface or in its gut may cause inflammation of the surrounding ocular tissues.
11
As mites scratch and feed on the skin, the partially digested epithelial cells, keratin, mite waste and eggs combine to form collarettes. These collarettes are typically found at the base of the lash but can migrate away as the hair shaft grows. 
The following figure illustrates collarettes at the base of an eyelash:
Figure 4: Collarettes Are the Pathognomonic Sign of 
Demodex
 Blepharitis
The Gao study confirmed the pathognomonic relationship of the collarette to 
Demodex
 infestation. The study included 55 patients seen at the Ocular Surface Center in Miami, Florida to determine the prevalence of 
Demodex
 in eyelashes with collarettes. All patients underwent a routine, complete eye examination and photography. Patients were divided into three main groups: (i) those with collarettes; (ii) those without collarettes and those who had been using daily lid scrubs for a full year; and (iii) those without collarettes who were not using daily lid scrubs. Of the 32 patients in the study, 100% of patients with at least one collarette had 
Demodex
 present. Those patients without collarettes were divided into two groups; patients who were using lid scrubs for a full year and those who were not. Only 7% (n=15) of patients without collarettes and who were not performing the daily lid scrubs had 
Demodex
, while 50% (n=8) of those subjects without collarettes, but who were using daily lid scrubs with shampoo for a full year, had 
Demodex
 infestation, implying that hygiene alone did not eradicate the mites. All 55 patients were seen at one location and may not be representative of the U.S. population. However, subsequent studies, including the XDEMVY pivotal Saturn-1 and Saturn-2 trials, that had >800 patients, consistently demonstrated a correlation between the presence of collarettes and 
Demodex
 mites.
Demodex
 blepharitis can be diagnosed by ECPs with a slit lamp examination, by confirming the presence of collarettes. The slit lamp examination is routinely performed by ECPs as part of standard practice during a customary eye examination, so diagnosing 
Demodex
 blepharitis via presence of collarettes would not involve any additional equipment or workflow alterations on the part of the ECP.
Treatment Options Before Approval of XDEMVY and Their Limitations
Other than the use of XDEMVY, the first ever FDA-approved pharmaceutical therapy for the treatment of
 Demodex
 blepharitis, 
Demodex
 blepharitis has been generally managed with a variety of over-the-counter remedies such as tea tree oil, lid wipes and artificial tears, as well as off-label prescription products for dry eye.
These approaches have significant limitations, including:
•
limited efficacy of over-the-counter and off-label treatments as well as device-based treatments administered in clinic by ECPs;
•
insufficient definitive knowledge of diagnostic criteria to guide treatment decisions;
•
prohibitive side effects (significant burning and stinging) from treatments that target 
Demodex
 mites (e.g. tea tree oil);
•
current treatments do not typically eradicate the 
Demodex
 mites, leading to a chronic and progressive disease; and
•
some treatments may be harmful (e.g. to meibomian gland epithelial cells).
12
According to the Titan real-world prevalence study, 75% of patients using tea tree oils and 57% of those using lid wipes were found to have a high prevalence of collarettes, indicating that current management tools for this disease are ineffective. The Titan study was an Institutional Review Board ("IRB") -approved, retrospective chart review of 1,032 patients across six U.S.-based ophthalmology and optometry practices conducted by seven investigators. The study was designed to better understand the prevalence of 
Demodex
 blepharitis via collarettes in U.S. eye care clinics.
Our Approach: Treating 
Demodex
 Mites, a Root Cause of Disease
To address these limitations and high unmet need for effectively treating 
Demodex
 blepharitis, we developed and are in the process of commercializing XDEMVY
, 
which is the definitive standard of care for the treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis. XDEMVY is a novel therapeutic based on the drug lotilaner, which is designed to paralyze and eradicate mites and other parasites through the inhibition of parasite-specific GABA-Cl channels. XDEMVY met all endpoints in its clinical trials and was generally well tolerated throughout each of these trials. As a result, XDEMVY was approved by the FDA in July 2023 for the treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis and we began commercializing XDEMVY in August 2023. 
XDEMVY Eye Drops – Mechanism of Action
The active ingredient in XDEMVY is lotilaner, a member of a class of anti-parasitic molecules called isoxazolines. It is a potent non-competitive antagonist of insect and arachnid GABA-Cl channels. Lotilaner is designed to eradicate 
Demodex
 mites by selectively inhibiting GABA-Cl channels, causing mite paralysis and eventual death. It has demonstrated no binding to human GABA-Cl and other ion channels (e.g. hERG) and thus likely has no impact on the human nervous system. Lotilaner is a lipophilic molecule, which may promote its uptake in the oily sebum of the hair follicle, where the mites reside. In clinical trials, XDEMVY was topically applied to the eye BID to better ensure delivery of the drug to the eyelid margin. Following mite eradication, collarettes eventually clear from the eyelid since they are composed of mite-related waste.
The following figures illustrate the intended paralysis of mites in the hair follicle by XDEMVY administration:
Figure 5: Progression of XDEMVY Application, Mite Paralysis and Eradication
Clinical Development Program
To date we have completed seven clinical trials that include one Phase 3 trial, one Phase 2b/3 trial, four Phase 2 trials, and one Phase 1 trial for XDEMVY in 
Demodex
 blepharitis, all of which met primary, secondary and/or certain exploratory endpoints, while demonstrating XDEMVY was well tolerated. These pivotal trial results (Phase 2b/3 and Phase 3) supported the FDA approval of XDEMVY in July 2023. 
13
We have also completed, and/or have ongoing clinical trials for the potential treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis in patients with MGD including the Ersa trial involving XDEMVY, and the Rhea trial involving a XDEMVY vehicle; TP-04 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea, and TP-05 for potential Lyme disease prophylaxis, among others.
The Saturn-2 Trial
In May 2021, we initiated the Saturn-2 trial; a randomized, controlled, multicenter, double-masked trial studying the safety and efficacy of XDEMVY for the treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis. The Saturn-2 trial was similar in design and size to the Saturn-1 trial, which met the primary and all secondary endpoints. The Saturn-2 trial's primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving collarette cure, defined as zero to two collarettes per lid. Secondary endpoints included the eradication of 
Demodex
 mites and the proportion of patients achieving a cure based on a composite of collarette cure and erythema cure (eyelid redness). A statistically significant outcome for primary efficacy endpoints is typically one of the requirements for FDA approval of a product. A statistically significant outcome indicates that the probability of the outcome occurring at random is less than the pre-established allowed error level, frequently set at 0.05 (or 1 in 20).
In May 2022, we announced positive topline results of the Saturn-2 trial, our second XDEMVY pivotal trial. The Saturn-2 trial enrolled 412 adults having, among other things, more than ten collarettes per lid and at least mild lid erythema. All pre-specified primary and secondary endpoints were met, XDEMVY was well tolerated and improvement in lids (reduction of collarettes to no more than 2 collarettes per upper lid) was demonstrated in 55% of patients treated with XDEMVY.
Primary Endpoint:
•
55% of patients on XDEMVY achieved complete collarette cure, defined as zero to two collarettes per lid at day 43, compared to 12% on vehicle (p<0.0001).
Secondary Endpoints:
•
50% of patients on XDEMVY achieved mite eradication defined as zero mites per lash at day 43, compared to 14% on vehicle (p<0.0001).
•
30% of patients on XDEMVY compared to 9% of patients on vehicle (p<0.0001) achieved complete lid erythema cure at day 43.
•
19% of patients on XDEMVY achieved a complete composite cure, based on achieving both complete collarette cure and complete lid erythema cure, compared to 4% on vehicle (p<0.0001) at day 43.
Safety Profile:
•
Consistent with the results from the Saturn-1 trial, the Saturn-2 trial demonstrated that XDEMVY was well tolerated with a safety profile similar to the vehicle group. 
▪
91% of XDEMVY patients reported that the drop comfort was neutral to very comfortable. 
▪
There were no serious treatment-related adverse events nor any treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. 
Additional Analysis:
•
89% of patients on XDEMVY achieved a clinically meaningful collarette reduction, defined as zero to ten collarettes per lid at day 43 compared to 33% of those on vehicle (p<0.0001). 
The Saturn-1 Trial
In September 2020, we commenced the Saturn-1 trial; a randomized, controlled, multicenter, double-masked Phase 2b/3 trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of XDEMVY in adults with 
Demodex
 blepharitis. The Saturn-1 trial enrolled 421 adult patients having more than ten collarettes on the upper lid and at least mild erythema of the upper eyelid margin. Each 
14
patient had at least 1.5 mites per lash on the upper and lower eyelids combined. One drop of XDEMVY was self-administered twice per day in each eye for six weeks. Enrolled patients received no treatment for blepharitis symptoms (i.e. lid hygiene) during the trial or 14 days prior to enrollment. The primary endpoint was complete collarette cure (grade zero defined as - zero to two collarettes per lid) and the secondary endpoints included complete mite eradication (mite density of zero mites per lash) and composite cure (the presence of zero to two collarettes on the upper eyelid and the absence of erythema (redness).
In June 2021, we announced positive results of the Saturn-1 trial. The pre-specified primary and secondary endpoints were met, and improvement in lids (reduction of collarettes to no more than 2 collarettes per upper lid) was demonstrated in 44% of patients treated with XDEMVY.
44% of patients on XDEMVY achieved the primary endpoint of complete collarette reduction at day 43 compared to 7% on vehicle (p<0.0001). 81% of patients achieved a significant, clinically meaningful collarette count reduction defined as zero to ten collarettes per lid at day 43 compared to 23% of those on vehicle (p<0.0001). Additionally, a significant, clinically meaningful collarette reduction was seen in 23% of patients on XDEMVY compared to 11% on vehicle as early as day 8 (p=0.03). 
The secondary endpoint of complete mite eradication achieved statistically significant results by day 15, and 68% of patients on XDEMVY achieved mite eradication compared to 17% on vehicle (p<0.0001) at day 43. 
For composite cure, 13.4% of patients on TP-03 achieved a complete cure based on a composite endpoint of collarette cure and erythema cure compared to 1.0% on vehicle (p<0.0001) at day 43. Results for complete erythema cure (19% of patients on XDEMVY compared to 7% of patients on vehicle, p<0.0001) and one grade or more erythema improvement (45% of patients on XDEMVY compared to 28% of patients on vehicle, p=0.0002) were also statistically significant. Additionally, 92% of XDEMVY patients reported that the drop comfort was neutral to very comfortable. There were no serious treatment-related adverse events nor any treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation.
In July 2021, we presented additional data from the Saturn-1 trial at the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery 2021 Annual Meeting demonstrating high treatment response rates, and reinforcing the potential of XDEMVY to be the standard of care for

Demodex
 blepharitis patients.
•
95% of XDEMVY patients showed a significant improvement in mite count, achieving ≤0.5 mites per lash
•
93% of XDEMVY patients improved by at least one collarette grade
We also announced results from an additional Saturn-1 trial safety analysis, which reinforced XDEMVY’s positive profile, revealing that XDEMVY had no clinically significant adverse effect on multiple safety measures including Corrected Distance Visual Acuity ("CDVA"), corneal staining, and intraocular pressure ("IOP"), and no significant findings from slit lamp biomicroscopy or fundus exam in the study. In addition, no impact to endothelial cell density ("ECD") was demonstrated in a subset of 21 patients. ECD was further evaluated as part of the Saturn-2 trial plan and also demonstrated no impact.
Phase 2 Clinical Trials
We completed four Phase 2 clinical trials for XDEMVY, along with one additional ex vivo study, which included our Mars, Jupiter, Io, and Europa clinical trials. Key efficacy endpoints for our Mars and Jupiter clinical trials included collarette grade and mite density and key efficacy endpoints for our Io and Europa clinical trials included collarette cure rate based on collarette grade, which we refer to herein as collarette cure rate, and mite eradication rate. The primary, secondary and/or certain exploratory endpoints were met, as applicable, in such trials, and showed statistically significant cure and eradication rates in Io and Europa. XDEMVY was generally well tolerated throughout these trials.
Our Additional Product Candidates
TP-04 Topical Formulation for the Treatment of Ocular Rosacea
Rosacea
Rosacea is a chronic skin disease characterized by facial redness, inflammatory lesions, burning and stinging, which can flare up in response to certain triggers such as sun exposure or emotional stress. Approximately 10% of people in the U.S., or nearly 30 million Americans, are affected by rosacea and a study estimates rosacea prevalence can represent up to 5.4% 
15
of the global population. . More than half of all rosacea patients present with ocular manifestations. Hallmarks of Ocular Rosacea include telangiectasias and erythema (flushing or redness). Clinical symptoms can range from bloodshot appearance, foreign body sensation, burning or stinging, light sensitivity and blurred vision. Ocular rosacea can also lead to inflammatory MGD, conjunctivitis, and decreased visual acuity caused by corneal complications.
The cause of rosacea remains multifactorial but there is increasing evidence that 
Demodex
 mites play a role in the disease. Studies have found a correlation between 
Demodex
 infestation and rosacea, with a higher density of 
Demodex
 mites found in the skin of rosacea patients. A proposed theory suggests that the 
Bacillus oleronius
 bacteria has a pathogenic role, contributing to skin inflammation and the signs and symptoms of rosacea; these bacteria are also known to be sensitive to the antibiotics typically prescribed to treat rosacea. Meanwhile, 
Demodex
 mites have been shown to carry 
Bacillus oleronius
 in their digestive tracts, suggesting that 
Demodex
 may contribute to rosacea by being a transporter for the bacteria that causes the disease. Furthering that point, there is evidence to suggest that 
Bacillus oleronius
 forms a symbiotic relationship with 
Demodex
, and that both species must be present in order to cause the signs and symptoms of rosacea. Other bacteria such as S
taphylococcus epidermidis
, also potentially carried by 
Demodex 
mites, may play a role in the disease as well. 
Our Approach: TP-04 Topical Formulation for Ocular Rosacea
There are no FDA-approved therapeutics for Ocular Rosacea available today. Treatment options include topical anti-inflammatories including steroids for acute flares, and topical and/or oral antibiotics (e.g. tetracyclines, azithromycin). To address this unmet need in the rosacea market, we are developing lotilaner as a topical sterile ophthalmic product, TP-04. TP-04 is designed to be active after topical administration with no systemic activity. Lotilaner’s mechanism of targeting and killing 
Demodex
 mites has been established through our preclinical study and clinical trials evaluating XDEMVY in 
Demodex
 blepharitis, which is why we believe it may be effective in another 
Demodex
 driven disease. We believe we can improve upon existing treatments with an API that is potentially more effective (longer half-life, more lipophilic, greater therapeutic window). We believe a longer half-life leads to a more durable and long-lasting treatment and that more lipophilicity is expected to provide better bioavailability in the sebum in the follicle and sebaceous glands where mites reside, thus increasing the opportunity to target and eradicate mites and a greater therapeutic window.
We have completed the initial preclinical studies and a Phase 1 trial for TP-04 and have selected a topical ophthalmic formulation for early clinical studies. We intend to leverage systemic preclinical data from our XDEMVY program such as embryofetal development studies, genotoxicity studies and safety pharmacology studies, and augment with the dermal toxicology studies. In March 2023, we initiated the Galatea trial evaluating TP-04, a novel gel formulation of lotilaner, for the treatment of rosacea. In February 2024, we announced positive topline results from the Galatea trial, which demonstrated statistically significant improvements (p<0.05) in inflammatory lesions and IGA score (change in baseline and success rate) were observed compared to vehicle at week 12. TP-04 was generally well tolerated. After review of this data with the FDA and KOLs, we decided to pursue development of TP-04 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea. In January 2025, we announced plans to initiate a Phase 2 study in the second half of 2025 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea. 
TP-05 Oral Formulation for Prophylactic Protection against Lyme Disease
Lyme Disease
Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S., caused by infection of 
Borrelia
 bacteria following a bite by a tick vector, predominantly ticks of the Ixodes genus (namely Ixodes scapularis in the U.S.). There are approximately 80 million people in the U.S. at risk of Lyme disease exposure with more than 30 million of which are moderate to high risk, according to a report commissioned by the Company. Further, there are approximately 400,000 reported cases in the U.S. each year, but it is believed that the actual number of cases could be more. We estimate a greater than $1.3 billion impact to the U.S. healthcare system as a result of Lyme disease. Lyme disease occurs most commonly in geographical areas where the Ixodes scapularis tick is prevalent, namely in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., but also in other regions of the U.S. Lyme disease also occurs in certain parts of Europe, typically resulting from a different Ixodes species vector.
The mechanism of Lyme disease infection is well understood.
 Borrelia
 bacteria colonizes the salivary glands of the ticks, and the infected saliva is transmitted to the human host when a tick attaches to a person for feeding. The transfer usually occurs at the conclusion of the feeding and therefore, the probability of 
Borrelia
 transmission, and thus the risk of Lyme disease, increases with the duration of the tick’s attachment. 
Borrelia
 is rarely transferred during the first or even second day of feeding but transfers quite efficiently during and after the third day of feeding (greater than 48 hours). This window from the time of bite to the time of transmission offers an opportunity for intervention to prevent Lyme disease if the tick can be killed prior to the transfer of the 
Borrelia
 bacteria.
16
Lyme disease can be a serious condition that may affect multiple organ systems and produce a broad range of symptoms. Early symptoms include a localized rash, fever and fatigue. More severe, sometimes chronic, symptoms may evolve as the infection spreads, including fever, muscle and joint pain, peripheral and central neurological deficits and lymphocytic meningitis. Lyme disease can be successfully treated with oral antibiotics when diagnosed sufficiently early, but chronic symptoms can commonly persist beyond antibiotic treatment. Because many people are either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, the treatment of Lyme disease with antibiotics may be commonly delayed or absent.
Current Lyme Disease Prophylaxis Options and Their Limitations
Lyme disease is currently prevented through behavior modification – avoiding areas where ticks are prevalent, wearing clothing which minimizes tick exposure, using insect repellants, and physically removing ticks that have attached. With the exception of removing attached ticks, none of these approaches prevents the transmission of 
Borrelia
 post-bite.
Moreover, there are currently no FDA-approved small molecules or biologics for the prevention of Lyme disease. A vaccine for Lyme disease, LYMERix, was developed and launched by SmithKline Beecham in 1999. Approximately 1.5 million doses of the vaccine were sold in 1999, but the product was quickly removed from the market following negative press and a class-action litigation claiming a dangerous side effect profile. We are aware of vaccines currently under development including a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine, VLA-15, being developed by Valneva in partnership with Pfizer for Lyme disease; mRNA-based vaccine mRNA-1982/1975, being developed by Moderna and eliciting high levels of anti-OspA antibodies; and a pre-exposure prophylaxis injectable therapy being developed by MassBiologics involving a human anti-Lyme monoclonal antibody.
Our Approach: TP-05 Oral Formulation for the Prophylactic Protection against Lyme Disease
Since 
Borrelia
 is usually transferred during the second or third day following a tick bite, our approach is to eradicate the tick before it can transmit the bacteria. To do this, we are developing TP-05 as an oral tablet formulation of lotilaner. We are targeting potentially at least 30 days of prophylactic protection against Lyme disease with a simple oral regimen of TP-05. Given that lotilaner was developed specifically, in part, to eradicate ticks with systemic administration to domesticated animals such as dogs or cats, the pharmacology of lotilaner for Lyme disease prophylaxis is well understood. Similar to its mechanism against 
Demodex
 mites, lotilaner is a potent non-competitive antagonist of tick GABA-Cl channels. Antagonism of these channels in ticks induces paralysis and eventual death. While lotilaner results in the paralysis and eventual death of the 
I. scapularis
 vector, it does also result in the death of 
Borrelia burgdorferi
, a non-free-living bacterium whose entire survival is conditional upon its living host. The high selectivity for insect and arachnid GABA-Cl channels over human channels where there has been no demonstrated binding, is a highly advantageous part of the profile of the molecule. Extensive preclinical systemic toxicology and safety pharmacology studies have been performed by third parties to date and support advancing TP-05 into clinical development. Lotilaner has a long, approximately 30-day systemic half-life in dogs, which we believe could provide for a convenient oral tablet administration.
In December 2022, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 1 Callisto trial for TP-05, a novel, oral, non-vaccine therapeutic for the potential prevention of Lyme disease. The Callisto trial was a randomized, double-blind, single and multiple-ascending dose trial that evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic ("PK") of TP-05 in healthy subjects. Results from the trial showed that TP-05 was well tolerated with no dose-related or drug-related serious adverse events. PK data from the trial demonstrated rapid absorption and an extended half-life of TP-05 that potentially supports a convenient oral regiment supporting its potential as a rapid onset, prophylactic therapy for Lyme disease. Additionally, exploratory ex-vivo tick kill modeling that utilized serum from TP-05 treated subjects demonstrated potent, rapid killing of adult and nymph ticks. In December 2022, we also announced the initiation of the Phase 2a Carpo trial, evaluating TP-05 for the potential prevention of Lyme disease in humans. The Carpo trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of TP-05 in killing lab grown, non-disease carrying ticks after they have attached to the skin of healthy volunteers, as well as confirm the safety, tolerability, and blood concentration of TP-05. In February 2024 we announced positive topline results from the Carpo trial.
In December 2024, we met with the FDA about our Lyme disease program. The FDA agreed to our proposed approach for a Phase 2b clinical trial, which plans to include several hundred subjects. Additionally, the FDA confirmed that a Phase 3 clinical study would require a disease prevention field study that would likely require the enrollment of thousands of patients. We continue to believe that the best approach to get this potential prophylactic therapy to patients is to partner this program either prior to the initiation of the Phase 2b study or after the completion of the study.
We believe TP-05 is currently the only non-vaccine, drug-based prophylaxis in development designed to target ticks, and potentially prevent Lyme disease transmission. It is designed to rapidly and durably provide systemic blood levels of 
17
lotilaner potentially sufficient to kill infected ticks attached to the human body before they can transmit the 
Borrelia
 bacteria that causes Lyme disease. 
Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls ("CMC")
We do not currently own or operate and currently have no plans to establish facilities for manufacturing, storing, distributing or testing our product or product candidates. We rely and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future on contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") to manufacture and supply our preclinical and clinical materials to be used during the development of our product candidates. We have assembled a team of employees and consultants to oversee our technical quality and CMOs.
Our lead product, XDEMVY, is a presentation of lotilaner, the API, formulated into a topical eye drop formulation. We believe that the existing capacity of our current API supplier is sufficient to support commercial scale-up, validation and commercial launch activities. Our current supplier currently manufactures current good manufacturing practice ("cGMP") lotilaner at multiple geographically distinct facilities.
Although we have relied on a single supplier for both non-clinical and clinical supply for lotilaner under cGMP protocols and a single CMO to manufacture XDEMVY and to perform analytical testing services, we have identified and are in the process of qualifying an additional manufacturer to provide lotilaner and drug product manufacturing and analytical testing services. The drug product manufacturing is a compounding and aseptic filling operation that we believe could be transferred to additional CMOs as necessary. We have suppliers for TP-04 topical formulation for Ocular Rosacea and TP-05 oral formulation for our Phase 1/2 trials.
Our third-party service providers, our third-party supply chain providers, their facilities and XDEMVY used in our clinical trials or for commercial sale are required to be in compliance with the requirements of cGMP. The cGMP regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and packaging containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. Product candidates used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements and manufacturing specifications and processes must satisfy FDA or other authorities’ requirements before any product is approved and before we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of XDEMVY to assess compliance with applicable regulations. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party providers and supply chain providers, to comply with such statutory and regulatory requirements could subject us to possible legal or regulatory action, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, suspension of production, warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. Any of these actions could have a material impact on commercial supplies of XDEMVY, clinical supplies of TP-03 or our other product candidates. Contract manufacturers at times encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any products or product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing approaches and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our products or product candidates will include efficacy, combinability, safety profile, convenience, cost, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection.
Other than XDEMVY, there are currently no other on-label prescription pharmaceutical treatments available for the treatment of blepharitis or 
Demodex
 blepharitis specifically, in the U.S. Other than XDEMVY, current treatments for blepharitis in the U.S. include over the counter and off-label remedies such as tea tree oil, lid wipes and artificial tears. We are aware of other companies developing potential prescription therapies for blepharitis, including Azura Ophthalmics, Aperta Biosciences, LLC, Formosa Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Glaukos Corp., Hovione Scientia, Nicox, Premark Pharma, Quorum Innovations, and Viatris. To our knowledge, Azura Ophthalmics, Aperta Biosciences, LLC, Atticus Medical, and Glaukos Corp. are the only companies currently focused on 
Demodex
 blepharitis and are in pre-clinical stage for the 
Demodex
 blepharitis indication (Aperta, Atticus, and Glaukos have publicly disclosed plans to initiate Phase 2 trials in 2025), and Premark Pharma, Azura Ophthalmics, Nicox, and Viatris are the only companies with blepharitis programs that have completed Phase 2 trials.
18
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Sales and Marketing
We launched XDEMVY in the U.S. in August 2023. In 2024, XDEMVY generated $180.1 million of net product sales driven by the following:
•
More than 163,000 bottles have been dispensed to patients;
•
More than 15,000 ECPs have prescribed XDEMVY;
•
Broad commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid reimbursement has extended to more than 90% of covered lives, as of February 25, 2025; and
•
Gross to net discounts of approximately 45%.
There are approximately 25 million people in the U.S. who suffer from 
Demodex
 blepharitis, however, we are initially targeting the approximately 9 million people who are proactively seeking treatment for 
Demodex 
blepharitis or seeking treatment for complementary eye conditions or treatments.
To date, we have observed increased adoption and utilization in the additional 
Demodex
 blepharitis patient segments noted above, which was further validated by our latest market research detailing that even at this early stage in the launch, approximately 40% of ECPs surveyed are already prescribing XDEMVY across each of these additional patient segments. And over 90% of the ECPs indicated they plan to increase utilization across these segments.
Outside the U.S., we intend to further develop commercialization strategies for TP-03, which may include collaborations with other companies. In March 2021, we entered into the China Out-License with LianBio Ophthalmology Limited ("LianBio"), granting exclusive commercial rights of TP-03 for the treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis and MGD within the China Territory. In March 2024, we executed an agreement with GrandPharma and LianBio to transition these rights to 
19
GrandPharma. The terms of this agreement are further described below in the section "
License Agreements: GrandPharma Agreement
." We are also exploring development and commercialization opportunities in other markets, including Europe and Japan. 
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology with a combination of patent rights that we own or license in certain fields of use, trademark rights, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We seek not only to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology in select key global markets, but also to supplement our intellectual property portfolio with new filings and applications to enhance such protection and support commercialization of current and future product candidates. To that end, we continue to seek protection for our technological innovations and branding efforts by filing new patent and trademark applications when and where appropriate. In the normal course of business, we intend to pursue, when possible, composition, method of use, dosing and formulation patent protection, as well as manufacturing and drug development processes and technology.
Our patent portfolio includes a combination of issued patents and pending patent applications licensed from third parties, as well as those assigned solely to us based on our ongoing development activities. The patents and applications in our portfolio can be categorized as related to XDEMVY, TP-03, TP-04, TP-05 or future pipeline product candidates and alternative technologies. Some of our issued patents and patent applications are exclusively licensed to us in therapeutic fields of use from Elanco. 
As of December 31, 2024, the material licensed-in portfolio includes approximately 38 issued patents and approximately 17 pending patent applications from Elanco. These patents and patent applications relate to lotilaner and are issued or pending in, for example, the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Columbia, several European territories, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, South Africa and Taiwan. The issued patents include composition of matter claims. The estimated natural expiration dates of the issued material in-licensed patents is approximately 2029 or 2030 with a potential extension until 2032.
Approximately 76 of our owned material patents and pending patent applications include treatment and composition of matter claims which relate to XDEMVY or TP-03 with respect to our lead indication (e.g., isoxazoline parasiticides for the treatment of
 Demodex
 blepharitis), as well as other conditions. These pending material patent applications include applications in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, several European territories, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, and South Africa. We have a total of 38 material XDEMVY or TP-03-related issued patents worldwide. The estimated natural expiration dates of these issued patents are in 2038, and if additional patents issue on the material XDEMVY or TP-03-related pending applications of ours, the estimated natural expiration dates are between approximately 2038 and 2040.
Our continuing research and development activities, technical expertise and contractual arrangements supplement our existing intellectual property protection and help us maintain our competitive position, and we rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary information and technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable, or where such patents would be difficult to enforce. In order to maintain such trade secrets and other proprietary information, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors.
We also protect our brand through trademark rights. As of December 31, 2024, we own: i) approximately 7 trademark registrations in the U.S., ii) approximately 3 pending trademark applications in the U.S., iii) approximately 34 trademark registrations in foreign countries, and iv) approximately 50 pending trademark applications in foreign countries. In order to supplement the protection of our brand, we also own at least 6 registered internet domain names.
Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy
We continue to make substantial investments to augment the capabilities of our people, processes, and technologies in order to address our cybersecurity risks. Our cybersecurity risks, and the controls designed to mitigate those risks, are integrated into our overall risk management governance and are reviewed quarterly by our Board of Directors (the "Board").
As of December 31, 2024, we've implemented a set of comprehensive cybersecurity and data protection policies and procedures. Our employees and contractors receive regular cybersecurity awareness trainings, including specific topics related to social engineering and email fraud. We have capable employees and consultants with significant expertise and certifications in cybersecurity related to our industry, as well as access to additional resources and other third parties as needed. 
20
We invest in advanced technologies for continuous cybersecurity monitoring across our information technology environment which are designed to prevent, detect, and minimize cybersecurity attacks, as well as alert management of such attacks.
Our Information Technology General Controls ("ITGCs") are established based on recognized industry standards and cover areas such as risk management, data backup, and disaster recovery. We have implemented processes to monitor security threats and vulnerabilities and respond to all cybersecurity incidents affecting us, including prompt escalation and communication of major security incidents to senior business leadership and our Board. We conduct cybersecurity penetration testing annually to identify and remediate cybersecurity gaps. We also perform cybersecurity assessments of all our third-party providers who have access to our information technology systems and data.
License Agreements
Elanco In-License Agreement for Skin and Eye Diseases or Conditions in Humans
In January 2019, we entered into an agreement with Elanco granting us exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license rights to certain intellectual property for the development, marketing, and commercialization of lotilaner for the treatment, palliation, prevention or cure of any eye or skin disease or condition in humans (as amended and restated in June 2022, the "Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement"). We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products comprising lotilaner and must achieve certain developmental milestones within specified achievement deadlines. If we fail to meet these obligations, Elanco has the right to terminate the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement. We utilize the intellectual property licensed under the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement in our TP-03 and TP-04 product candidates. We are permitted to have certain third parties manufacture lotilaner for us and, upon Elanco's consent, additional third parties.
Under the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement, we have made cash payments to Elanco totaling $14.0 million for clinical milestone achievements, including: a $1.0 million upfront payment at execution in 2019, and a total of $4.0 million for three specified clinical milestone achievements in September 2020, April 2021, and March 2023, which were recorded as research and development expense in the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the respective periods incurred. Additionally, a sales-based milestone of $5.0 million and a commercial milestone of $4.0 million were achieved and paid to Elanco during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These milestones were recorded to intangible assets and cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (see 
Note 9
).
In accordance with the terms of the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement, we are obligated to make further cash payments to Elanco upon our achievement of various clinical milestones up to an aggregate maximum of $2.0 million and various sales milestones up to an aggregate maximum of $70.0 million. If we receive certain types of payments from sublicensees, we are obligated to pay Elanco a variable percentage in the mid to high single digits of such proceeds and decreasing after certain milestones are met, except for sublicense revenue. We owe Elanco tiered royalties during the royalty term in the mid-to-high single digits on our future net sales and those of our sublicensees. The royalty term for any licensed product in a given country commences on the date of first commercial sale of such licensed product and ends on the latest of (i) expiration of the last-to-expire of the licensed patents which has at least one valid claim, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity and (iii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. As a result of the commercialization of XDEMVY in August 2023, we began accruing royalties payable, which were recorded to cost of sales in the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement shall expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the applicable royalty term with respect to such licensed product in such country. The achievement deadlines for eye-related diligence milestones range between 18 months after contract execution to six years after contract execution. The achievement deadlines for dermatological diligence milestones range between 24 months after contract execution to nine years after contract execution. All eye-related and dermatological diligence milestones have been achieved.
Either party may terminate the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement upon a material breach by the other party, solely in the country pertaining to such breach, that is not cured within 60 days after receiving written notice thereof. If we fail to comply with our development obligations under the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement, and fail to remedy such failure or cure such breach within 60 days, Elanco will have the right to terminate the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement. If we fail to meet any diligence milestones by the achievement deadlines set forth in the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement for any reason other than those outside of our reasonable control, and such milestones remain unmet for 120 days after Elanco notifies us thereof, Elanco may terminate the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement. If we fail to meet certain dermatological milestones by the achievement deadlines set forth in the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement for any reasons other than those outside of our reasonable control, and such milestones remain unmet for 120 days after Elanco notifies us thereof, Elanco may limit our field of use under the Eye 
21
and Derm Elanco Agreement to the treatment, palliation, prevention or cure of eye diseases or conditions in humans only. If Elanco terminates the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement for our failure to achieve a development milestone by the specified achievement deadline, then we must grant Elanco a non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty free license to our patents and know-how relating to lotilaner to develop, manufacture and commercialize lotilaner and any licensed products for the treatment, palliation, prevention or cure of any eye or skin disease or condition in humans. Elanco may also terminate the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement if we, our affiliates or sublicensees initiate proceedings to oppose Elanco’s licensed patents and such proceeding is not withdrawn within 30 days of Elanco providing notice to us; provided that Elanco may not terminate the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement for a challenge by a sublicensee if we terminate the sublicense with such sublicensee within such 30 day period.
Under the terms of the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement, we granted Elanco a worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, perpetual license to our patents related to lotilaner and the licensed products and to our know-how to research, develop, make and commercialize lotilaner and the licensed products for all applications in non-human animals, agricultural application, seed treatment applications and urban pest applications related to structural, turf, lawns and gardens. We also granted Elanco an exclusive royalty-free, perpetual license to any intellectual property we conceive from our use of lotilaner applications in non-human animals, agricultural applications, seed treatment applications and urban pest applications related to structural, turf, lawns and gardens.
Elanco retains the sole responsibility to prosecute the patents they license to us and has the first right to enforce the licensed intellectual property against third parties in the licensed field of use but cannot settle or dispose of any such action without our written consent.
Elanco In-License Agreement for All Other Diseases or Conditions in Humans
In September 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Elanco (the "All Human Uses Elanco Agreement") granting us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain intellectual property for the development, marketing, and commercialization of lotilaner for all applications in humans other than the treatment, palliation, prevention or cure of any eye or skin disease or condition. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products comprising lotilaner and must achieve certain developmental milestones within specified achievement deadlines. If we fail to meet these obligations, Elanco has the right to terminate the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement. We utilize the intellectual property licensed under the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement in our TP-05 product candidates. We are permitted to have certain third parties manufacture lotilaner for us and, upon Elanco's consent, additional third parties.
Under the terms of the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement, we issued 
222,460 shares
 of our common stock to Elanco at the execution of the agreement in September 2020, with an estimated fair value of $3.1 million. 
In March 2021, we issued 187,500 shares of our common stock to Elanco, with an estimated fair value of $5.5 million, to maintain the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement.
 In December 2022, we achieved a clinical milestone of $0.5 million related to the initiation of our Phase 2a Carpo trial for the potential treatment of Lyme disease. 
Under the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement, we have made cash payments to Elanco totaling $0.5 million for clinical milestone achievements. We are required to make additional cash payments to Elanco upon the achievement of various clinical milestones for an aggregate maximum of $4.0 million and various commercial and sales threshold milestones for an aggregate maximum of $77.0 million. In addition, we are obligated to pay contractual royalties to Elanco for sales in certain countries. If we receive payments from sublicensees, we are obligated to pay Elanco a variable percentage beginning in the low to mid double-digits of such proceeds and decreasing after certain milestones are met, except for sublicense revenue generated after achieving regulatory approval for the use of lotilaner to applications in humans other than to treat or cure any eye or skin disease or condition. We owe Elanco tiered royalties during the royalty term in the mid-to-high single digits on our future net sales and those of our sublicensees. The royalty term for any licensed product in a given country commences on the date of first commercial sale of such licensed product and ends on the latest of (a) expiration of the last-to-expire of the licensed patents which has at least one valid claim, (b) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity, or (c) ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. The All Human Uses Elanco Agreement shall expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the applicable royalty term with respect to such licensed product in such country. The achievement deadlines for diligence milestones range between 24 months after contract execution to six years after contract execution.
Either party may terminate the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement upon a material breach by the other party, solely in the country pertaining to such breach, that is not cured within 60 days after receiving written notice from the other party. If we fail to comply with our development obligations under the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement, and fail to remedy 
22
such failure or cure such breach within 60 days, Elanco will have the right to terminate the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement. If we fail to meet any diligence milestones by the achievement deadlines set forth in the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement for any reason other than those outside of our reasonable control, and such milestones remain unmet for 120 days after Elanco notifies us of the failure to meet such diligence milestone, Elanco may terminate the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement. If Elanco terminates the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement for our failure to achieve a development milestone by the specified achievement deadline, then we must grant Elanco a non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty free license to our patents and know-how relating to lotilaner to develop, manufacture and commercialize lotilaner and any licensed products for all applications in humans other than the treatment, palliation, prevention or cure of any eye or skin disease or condition. Elanco may also terminate the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement if we, our affiliates or sublicensees initiate proceedings to oppose Elanco’s licensed patents and such proceeding is not withdrawn within 30 days of Elanco providing notice to us; provided that Elanco may not terminate the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement for a challenge by a sublicensee if we terminate the sublicense with such sublicensee within such 30-day period.
Under the terms of the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement, we granted to Elanco a non-exclusive worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, perpetual license to our patents related to lotilaner and the licensed products and to our know-how to research, develop, make and commercialize lotilaner and the licensed products for all applications in non-human animals and other non-human-use applications, agricultural applications, seed treatment applications and urban pest applications related to structural, turf, lawns and gardens. We also grant to Elanco an exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to any intellectual property we conceive from our use of lotilaner for all applications in non-human animals and other non-human applications.
Elanco retains the sole responsibility to prosecute the patents they license to us and has the first right to enforce the licensed intellectual property against third parties in the licensed field of use but cannot settle or dispose of any such action without our written consent.
GrandPharma Agreement
In March 2021, we entered into the China Out-License with LianBio (the "China Out-License") for its exclusive development and commercialization rights of TP-03 (lotilaner ophthalmic solution) 0.25% in The People's Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong, and Taiwan (the "China Territory") for the treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis and MGD.
In February 2024, LianBio announced its plan to wind down its operations and in March 2024 made a special cash dividend payment to the Company of $0.7 million (equivalent to $4.80 per share - see 
Note 3
). In March 2024, the Company executed an agreement assigning the China Out-License from LianBio to GrandPharma (the "Novation Agreement") and LianBio made a one-time payment of $2.5 million (the "Termination Payment") to the Company in April 2024. The Termination Payment was recorded as license fees and collaboration revenue in the accompanying Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. The Novation Agreement amended the $15.0 million future development milestone payable on China regulatory approval of the China Out-License with a combined condition of patent issuance related to TP-03 in China.
Simultaneous with the execution of the Novation Agreement, the Company entered into a warrant termination agreement (the "Warrant Termination Agreement) for a total cancellation payment received by us of $0.4 million (the "Warrant Cancellation Payment"). This Warrant Cancellation Payment was recorded as license fees and collaboration revenue in the accompanying Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024.
Through December 31, 2024, we received aggregate payments from LianBio totaling $86.1 million comprised of: (i) initial consideration of $15.0 million; (ii) $67.5 million for the achievement of specified milestone events; (iii) $2.5 million upon execution of the Novation Agreement; (iv) $0.4 million upon execution of the Warrant Termination Agreement; and (v) $0.7 million related to a special cash dividend.
As of December 31, 2024, we will be eligible to receive further consideration from GrandPharma upon the achievement of additional TP-03 events, including: (i) additional regulatory and/or patent milestones of up to an aggregate of $20.0 million; (ii) China-based TP-03 sales threshold milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $100.0 million and (iii) tiered low-to-high-teen royalties for China Territory TP-03 product sales. The variable consideration related to the remaining milestone payments was fully constrained as of December 31, 2024.

Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products such as those we are developing. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. We will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or trials or seek approval of our product candidates. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries, as appropriate, along with subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and resources.
U.S. Drug Regulation
In the U.S., we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, which regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA"), and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the U.S. Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. or foreign requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-marketing may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, market acceptance of our products, and our reputation.
Our product candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process generally involves the following:
•
completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice ("GLP") requirements;
•
submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S. and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
•
approval by an independent IRB or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•
performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices ("GCP"), requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
•
submission to the FDA of an NDA;
•
a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the submission for review;
•
satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with GCP;
•
potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing;
•
payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA as well as annual fees after NDA approval;
•
FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.; and
•
compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Migration Strategy ("REMS") and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
24
The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process can take many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or condition being treated.
Preclinical Studies and IND Submission
Before testing any drug product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for certain safety/toxicology studies. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S.
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA and clinical trials may proceed under such IND at such time, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development along with any subsequent changes to the investigational plan.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries, including the website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, ClinicalTrials.gov.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may still submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA may agree to accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials in the U.S. generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
•
Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
•
Phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
25
•
Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product for its intended use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product to provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
•
A Phase 1/2 clinical trial has elements of a Phase 1 trial and a Phase 2 trial. We have designated our TP-04 and TP-05 trials as Phase 1/2 trials since we intend to go beyond the typical safety and tolerability assessments of a Phase 1 trial and intend to have these trials include additional efficacy assessments as well.
•
A Phase 2b/3 clinical trial has elements of a late Phase 2 trial and a Phase 3 trial. We have designated the Saturn-1 trial as a Phase 2b/3 trial as it is both our first multi-center trial based in the U.S., and also a pivotal trial for the U.S.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds,

including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Equivalent, and similarly detailed, obligations will apply to the conduct of clinical trials in third countries including the European Union (“EU”).
NDA Review and Marketing Approval
Following completion of clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information, and other information in a request for approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The application must include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the U.S.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (the "PDUFA"), as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by an application user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a qualifying small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product NDA also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing to determine if they are sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, and the FDA may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it 
26
is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
Under PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, (i) standard review; and (ii) priority review. According to PDUFA performance goals, the FDA endeavors to review applications subject to standard review within ten months, whereas the FDA’s goal is to review priority review applications within six months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements.
The FDA generally accepts data from foreign clinical trials in support of an NDA if the trials were conducted under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA nevertheless may accept the data in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection, if deemed necessary. Although the FDA generally requests that marketing applications be supported by some data from domestic clinical studies, the FDA may accept foreign data as the sole basis for marketing approval if (1) the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, (2) the studies were performed by clinical investigators with recognized competence, and (3) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection or, if the FDA considers the inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means.
Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA also closely analyzes the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications and potentially subject to other requirements. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, including the potential requirement to conduct additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, or to conduct additional preclinical studies or manufacturing changes. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
Post-Approval Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the product is subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to facility registration and drug listing monitoring and record keeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the 
27
establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs, including after they are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS"), to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the NDA sponsor must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the FDA without an approved REMS, if required. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, its manufacturer or the NDA holder, including recalls.
The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay drug distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•
restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
•
fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•
refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
•
suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•
product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•
injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
Other Regulatory Matters
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. For example, in the U.S., sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. These laws include the following:
28
•
the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration (i.e., anything of value), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return either for the referral of an individual for, or for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from AKS liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance programs. The regulatory safe harbors also are subject to regulatory revision and interpretation by a number of government agencies. Liability under the AKS may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below). Violations of the AKS are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, damages, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs;
•
the federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”) which prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Such private individuals may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in recovery or settlement. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement for violations, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs;
•
the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"), which imposes criminal liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
•
HIPAA and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, on certain covered entity health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
•
federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;
•
the FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices, including off-label or pre-approval promotion;
29
•
the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") information regarding direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals (and certain other practitioners as of 2022), as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
•
analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non- governmental third-party payers, including private insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, state and local laws that require the licensure and registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Furthermore, states are constantly adopting new laws or amending existing laws, requiring attention to frequently changing regulatory requirements. For example, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"). The CCPA created new transparency requirements, granted California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) several new rights with regard their personal information, and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. In addition, the CPRA introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency (“CPPA”).

The amendments introduced by the CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023, and implementing regulations continue to be introduced by the CPPA. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and potential damages. Other states, including Virginia, Colorado, Utah, Indiana, Iowa, Tennessee, Montana, Texas, and Connecticut, have enacted privacy laws similar to the CCPA that impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business and we continue to assess the impact of these state legislations on our business as additional information and guidance becomes available. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the United States, at both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. Failure to comply with the CCPA and other state law may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or potential statutory or actual damages. These laws could impact our business activities depending on how they are interpreted and exemplify the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. We have implemented processes to manage compliance with the CCPA and other state laws and we continue to assess their impact on our business as additional information and guidance becomes available.
Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, compliance oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.

U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full 505(b)(1) NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
European Union Drug Development
Similar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the European Union Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the 27 member states of the EU (the "EU Member States") have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the regime of the Clinical Trials Directive, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority ("NCA"), and one or more ethics committees. Under the regime of the Clinical Trials Directive all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
In order to streamline the regulation of clinical trials across the EU, the EU legislator has adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (the "EU Clinical Trials Regulation"). The new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, which has repealed and replaced the EU Clinical Trials Directive, introduced a complete overhaul of the former regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure through a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation is applicable as of January 31, 2022 and is applicable directly in all countries of the European Economic Area ("EEA") (which is comprised of 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). Clinical trials that were authorized under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2023 can continue to be conducted under the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025.

An application to transition ongoing trials from the current Clinical Trials Directive to the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation will need to be submitted and authorized in time before the end of the transitional period. From January 31, 2023 onwards, the application for new clinical trials must be 
31
done in accordance with the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation is intended to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EEA.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In order to market any product outside of the U.S., a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy, and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trial or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions.
Marketing Authorization
In the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization ("MA"). There are a number of types of marketing authorizations.
•
The Community MA is adopted by the European Commission in the form of a decision through the Centralized Procedure (the "Centralized Procedure"). The decision, which is based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP") of the European Medicine Agency ("EMA"), is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional, on approval by the EMA for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.
Under the Centralized Procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting an initial scientific assessment of a product. The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MA under the Centralized Procedure is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP.
Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the Centralized Procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
•
MAs based on the Mutual Recognition Procedure or the Decentralized Procedure are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product is first authorized by a Reference Member State this may be recognized by other Concerned Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. Alternatively, a product can be approved simultaneously in various EU Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the EU Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State. The competent authority of the Reference Member State prepares a draft assessment report, a draft Summary of Product Characteristics ("SmPC") and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the "Concerned Member States") for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the Reference Member State, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the Reference Member State and the Concerned Member States).
Regulatory data protection and market exclusivity in the EU 
In the EU, new medicinal products are granted a protection period of 8 years of data exclusivity and an additional 2 years of market exclusivity. As such, for a period of 8 years, generics cannot use the data of the innovator to obtain a marketing authorization. Only after 8 years have lapsed, other parties that apply for a marketing authorization (generics or biosimilars) may make reference to the dossier of the originator product. Only after another 2 years (i.e. a total of 10 years) may such 
32
generic or biosimilar medicinal product be placed on the market. In April 2023, the European Commission published a proposal to reform this system. In this proposal, the current standard period of regulatory data protection will be reduced from eight years to six years. The legislative process for this reform is expected to take several years. It is currently uncertain if the proposal will be adopted in its current form and it is uncertain if and when the revised legislation would enter into force.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. In the U.S., for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare program through regional contractors, state Medicaid programs, third-party payers, and insurance plans. These entities decide whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed based on clinical needs and economic impact. To date, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payer-by-payer basis.
Increasingly, third-party payers are requiring that drug companies provide them with discounts usually in the form of rebates from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payers are examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of newly launched drugs. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs or new indications for products as several large payers have implemented new to market blocks that can last anywhere between six to twelve months. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct additional expensive pharmaco-economic Phase 4 real-world studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Additionally, maintaining coverage for a product is often evaluated annually by payers and additional barriers may be placed impacting access. We are committed to partnering with payers to ensure broad access and affordability.
Pharmaceutical Pricing
We participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part D Coverage Gap Discounts Program ("Medicare Part D"). Participation is required for federal funds to be available for our covered outpatient drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B ("Medicare Part B"), and under Medicare Part D, respectively. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a mandatory rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid. Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by the manufacturer on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug, which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any wholesaler, retailer, provider, health maintenance organization, nonprofit entity, or governmental entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts, and other price concessions. Under the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap Discount Program, manufacturers, including us, are currently required to provide to CMS a 70% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries are in the coverage gap phase of the Medicare Part D benefit design. The IRA sunsets the coverage gap discount program starting in 2025 and replaces it with a new manufacturer discount program.
The Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) (addressed further in the section on “Healthcare Reform”) made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and CMS issued a final regulation to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the ACA. CMS also issued a final regulation that modified prior Medicaid Drug Rebate Program regulations to permit reporting multiple best price figures with regard to value based purchasing arrangements; and provide definitions for “line extension,” “new formulation,” and related terms, with the practical effect of expanding the scope of drugs considered to be line extensions that are subject to an alternative rebate formula.
Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B ceiling price for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling 
33
price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Further, the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA") of 2022 (addressed further in the section on “Healthcare Reform”) establishes a Medicare Part D inflation rebate schemes (the first rebate period is in fourth quarter 2022 through third quarter 2023) and a drug price negotiation program, with the first negotiated prices to take effect in 2026. It also makes several changes to the Medicare Part D benefit, including the creation of a new manufacturer discount program in place of the current coverage gap discount program (beginning in 2025).
In addition, to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, a manufacturer also must participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") Federal Supply Schedule ("FSS") pricing program. Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make its innovator and single source products available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies, the VA, U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), Public Health Service and U.S. Coast Guard - that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price ("FCP"). Manufacturers also are obligated to calculate and submit to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis, their Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”), which the VA uses to calculate the FCP. Moreover, pursuant to regulations issued by the DoD Defense Health Agency to implement Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, manufacturers are required to provide rebates on utilization of their innovator and single source products that are dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies.
The requirements under the Medicaid, 340B, FSS, and TRICARE programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from any products that are commercialized in the future and could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to comply with any applicable obligations under governmental pricing programs that we participate in, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, significant civil monetary penalties, sanctions and fines, and those could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products and/or lower cost over the counter alternatives for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits.
There have been judicial challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by Congress to modify, and by agencies to alter the implementation of, certain aspects of the ACA. For example, Congress eliminated the tax penalty for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the ACA to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the "donut hole"

(the IRA sunsets the coverage gap discount program and replaces it with a new manufacturer discount, beginning in 2025).
34
It is possible that the ACA, as currently enacted or may be amended in the future, as well as other healthcare reform measures including those that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, and less favorable payment methodologies, or other downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement or restriction on coverage under Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction or restriction by private payers. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year required by the Budget Control Act of 2021, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (“ATRA”).

Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, generally to 2031. Sequestration is currently set at 2% and will increase to 2.25% for the first half of fiscal year 2030, to 3% for the second half of fiscal year 2030, and to 4% for the remainder of the sequestration period that lasts through the first six months of fiscal year 2031. ATRA, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Other new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations.
Moreover, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 ("MMA") established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates and in establishing their formulary placement.
Further, the IRA introduces several changes to the Medicare Part D benefit, including a limit on annual out-of-pocket costs and a change in manufacturer liability under the program which could negatively affect the profitability of our product candidates. The IRA sunsets the current Part D coverage gap discount program starting in 2025 and replaces it with a new manufacturer discount program. Failure to pay a discount under this new program will be subject to a civil monetary penalty. In addition, the IRA established a Medicare Part B inflation rebate scheme effective January 2023 and a Medicare Part D inflation rebate scheme effective October 2022, under which, generally speaking, manufacturers will owe rebates if the price of a Part B or Part D drug increases faster than the pace of inflation. Failure to timely pay a Part B or D inflation rebate is subject to a civil monetary penalty. The IRA also creates a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for Medicare units of certain high Medicare spend drugs and biologicals without generic or biosimilar competition will be capped by reference to, among other things, a specified non-federal average manufacturer price starting in 2026. Failure to comply with requirements under the drug price negotiation program is subject to an excise tax and/or a civil monetary penalty. Congress continues to examine various policy proposals that may result in pressure on the prices of prescription drugs with respect to the government health benefit programs and otherwise. The IRA or other legislative changes could impact the market conditions for our product candidates.
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Finally, some states have established Prescription Drug Affordability Boards (or similar entities) to review high-cost drugs and, in some cases, set upper payment limits.
