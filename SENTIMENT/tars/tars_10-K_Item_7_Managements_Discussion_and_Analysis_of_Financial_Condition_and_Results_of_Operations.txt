Overview
Our Business
We are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics, starting with eye care. We launched XDEMVY
®
 (lotilaner ophthalmic solution) 0.25%, formerly known as TP-03, for the treatment of 
Demodex 
blepharitis, in August 2023 after receiving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approval in July 2023. 
Demodex 
blepharitis is caused by the infestation of 
Demodex
 mites. Blepharitis (“Blephar” is a reference to eyelid and “itis” is a reference to inflammation) is an ophthalmic lid margin disease characterized by inflammation of the eyelid margin, redness and ocular irritation, including a specific type of eyelash dandruff called collarettes, which are pathognomonic for 
Demodex
 blepharitis. Poorly controlled and progressive blepharitis can lead to corneal damage over time and, in extreme cases, blindness. There may be as many as approximately 25 million people in the U.S. who suffer from 
Demodex
 blepharitis. XDEMVY is the first and only therapeutic approved by the FDA and we believe is the definitive standard of care for the treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis.
XDEMVY targets and eradicates the root cause of 
Demodex
 blepharitis – 
Demodex
 mite infestation. The active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") of XDEMVY, lotilaner, paralyzes and eradicates mites and other parasites through the inhibition of parasite-specific gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride ("GABA-Cl") channels with no GABA-Cl inhibition in humans.
To date, we have completed seven clinical trials that include a Phase 3 Saturn-2 trial, a Phase 2b/3 Saturn-1 trial, four Phase 2 trials, and a Phase 1 trial for XDEMVY in 
Demodex
 blepharitis, all of which met their primary, secondary and/or certain exploratory endpoints, with the drug well tolerated throughout each trial. We have also completed, and/or have ongoing clinical trials for the potential treatment of 
Demodex 
blepharitis in patients with Meibomian Gland Disease ("MGD"), including the Ersa clinical trial involving XDEMVY, and the Rhea clinical trial involving an XDEMVY vehicle; TP-04 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea; and TP-05 for potential Lyme disease prophylaxis, among others.
We intend to further advance our pipeline with the lotilaner API to address several diseases in human medicine, including eye care, and infectious disease prevention. We are investigating the development of our product candidates to address targeted diseases with high unmet medical needs, which currently include TP-04, a novel gel formulation of lotilaner for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea, and TP-05, a novel investigational oral formulation of lotilaner, for potential Lyme disease prophylaxis and community malaria reduction.

TP-03 
Demodex
 blepharitis in patients with Meibomian Gland Disease, Ersa and Rhea Trials

In December 2023, we announced positive topline results of the Ersa trial evaluating XDEMVY administered twice daily ("BID") or three times a day ("TID") for 6 weeks and 12 weeks for the treatment of MGD in patients with Demodex mites. XDEMVY demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements compared to baseline in two objective measures of the disease: the presence and quality of liquid secretion as measured by the Meibomian Gland Secretion Score; and the number of glands secreting normal or clear liquid. In November 2024, additional positive data was presented from the Ersa trial as well as data from the Rhea trial, a pilot study evaluating XDEMVY vehicle for the treatment of MGD in patients with Demodex mites, at the American Academy of Optometry ("AAOpt") Annual Meeting 2024. The Rhea trial enrolled a similar patient population as the Ersa trial, and evaluated the same outcomes, with the same dosing regimens, except the Rhea trial participants received XDEMVY vehicle. Both the Ersa and Rhea trials also assessed patient reported outcomes for some of the most commonly reported patient symptoms in Demodex blepharitis and MGD, namely fluctuating vision, itching, redness, and burning.  
The AAOpt presentation, which combined the Ersa and Rhea trials data in a pooled analysis, demonstrated that XDEMVY provided statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements from baseline and when compared to vehicle. These improvements were shown across three objective measures of MGD: 1) the presence and quality of liquid secretion as measured by the Meibomian Gland Secretion Score; 2) the number of glands secreting normal or clear liquid; and 3) the number of glands yielding any liquid. Improvements were also demonstrated across certain patient reported outcomes, including fluctuating vision, itching and redness. Further, XDEMVY demonstrated statistically significant rates of collarette cure and lid margin erythema cure that are consistent with previous XDEMVY studies. No statistically significant differences were observed between the BID and TID treatment arms in both the Ersa and Rhea trials, respectively, and XDEMVY and the XDEMVY vehicle were well tolerated. Given the positive results of these trials, plus the FDA’s feedback that these patients are already covered under XDEMVY’s label for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis, our medical affairs team is moving forward with sharing this data with ECPs.
TP-04 Rosacea, Galatea Trial

In March 2023, we initiated the Galatea trial, a Phase 2a trial evaluating TP-04, a novel gel formulation of lotilaner, for the treatment of rosacea. In February 2024, we announced positive topline results from the Galatea trial evaluating TP-04 for the treatment of rosacea which demonstrated statistically significant improvements (p<0.05) in inflammatory lesions and Investigator's Global Assessment score (change in baseline and success rate) were observed compared to vehicle at week 12. TP-04 was generally well tolerated. After review of this data with the FDA and Key Opinion Leaders, we decided to pursue development of TP-04 for the potential treatment for Ocular Rosacea. In January 2025, we announced plans to initiate a Phase 2 study in the second half of 2025 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea.
TP-05 Lyme Disease, Carpo Trial

In February 2024, we announced positive topline results from the Carpo trial, which demonstrated statistical significance in the mortality of ticks compared to vehicle (p<0.001), regardless of treatment arm, and was well tolerated. The Carpo trial is designed to evaluate TP-05, a novel investigational oral, non-vaccine pharmacological prophylactic for the potential prevention of Lyme disease in humans. The Carpo trial evaluated the efficacy of TP-05 in killing lab grown, non-disease carrying ticks after they have attached to the skin of healthy volunteers, as well as confirm the safety, tolerability, and blood concentration of TP-05.
In December 2024, we met with the FDA about our Lyme disease program. The FDA agreed to our proposed approach for a Phase 2b clinical trial, which would include several hundred subjects. Additionally, the FDA confirmed that a Phase 3 clinical study would require a disease prevention field study that would likely require the enrollment of thousands of patients. We continue to believe that the best approach to get this potential prophylactic therapy to patients is to partner this program either prior to the initiation of the Phase 2b study or after the completion of the study.   
99
Table of Content
We believe TP-05 is currently the only non-vaccine, drug-based prophylaxis in development that targets ticks, and potentially prevents Lyme disease transmission. It is designed to rapidly and durably provide systemic blood levels of lotilaner potentially sufficient to kill infected ticks attached to the human body before they can transmit the 
Borrelia
 bacteria that causes Lyme disease. 
Officer and Board Appointments

We expanded and strengthened our eye care leadership with two key appointments to our executive team and Board of Directors. Elizabeth Yeu, M.D. was appointed Chief Medical Officer in November 2024. Dr. Yeu is a distinguished ophthalmologist with more than two decades of experience who transitioned from her role as our Chief Medical Advisor and a member of our Board of Directors. Katherine H. Goodrich, M.D., MHS was appointed to our Board of Directors in November 2024. Dr. Goodrich is currently the Chief Medical Officer of Humana Inc., and brings decades of experience driving innovative and value-based initiatives designed to improve patient outcomes.
Additional Potential Growth Drivers in 2025 and Beyond
We are on track for potential European regulatory approval of a preservative-free formulation of XDEMVY for the potential treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis in 2027. We have initiated market development work, including Key Opinion Leader engagement, disease education and scientific presentations at major conferences. 
In Japan, we expect to share results from a 
Demodex
 blepharitis prevalence study in the first half of 2025 and meet with Japanese regulatory authorities to help determine a regulatory path forward. 
The Chinese regulatory agency, National Medical Products Administration, accepted the New Drug Application ("NDA") submitted by our partner, Grand Pharmaceutical Group Ltd., for TP-03 for 
Demodex
 blepharitis.
Corporate and Financial Overview
We were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in November 2016, and our headquarters are located in Irvine, California. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, acquiring intellectual property, clinical development of our product candidates, commercializing XDEMVY, building our research and development capabilities, raising capital, and enhancing our corporate infrastructure. 
To date we have financed our operations through private placements of preferred stock, convertible promissory notes, net proceeds from issuance of common stock in our Initial Public Offering ("IPO"), our subsequent follow-on public offerings in May 2022 (the "May 2022 Public Offering"), August 2023 (the "August 2023 Public Offering"), and March 2024 (the "March 2024 Public Offering", collectively the "Follow-On Public Offerings"), and our Open Market Sale Agreement
TM
 (the "2023 ATM Prospectus"), as well as proceeds from net product sales, our China Out-License, and drawdowns from the Credit Facilities.
We have incurred significant net operating losses ("NOLs") in every year since our inception and expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses as we commercialize XDEMVY for 
Demodex
 blepharitis, and, as we advance our other product candidates through clinical trials, regulatory submissions, and potential commercialization. Our net losses were $115.6 million, $135.9 million and $62.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and could be substantial. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we:
•
continue to commercialize XDEMVY and our other product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approvals;
•
maintain regulatory approval for XDEMVY and seek regulatory approval for our other product candidates that successfully complete clinical development, if any;
•
advance the clinical development of TP-04 for the potential treatment of Ocular Rosacea and TP-05 for the potential Lyme disease prophylaxis;
•
engage with contract manufacturers to ensure a sufficient supply chain capacity to provide commercial quantities of XDEMVY and any other products for which we may obtain marketing approval;
•
maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
100
Table of Content
•
hire additional staff, including clinical, scientific, technical, regulatory, marketing, sales, operations, financial, and other support personnel, to execute our business plan; and
•
add information systems and personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts, and to enable us to operate as a public company.
We began generating product sales during the year ended December 31, 2023, following the FDA approval of XDEMVY in July 2023 and our subsequent commercial launch in August 2023. Our reported revenue within license fees and collaboration revenue is from our China Out-License and clinical supply agreement; we expect to report additional revenue under this caption in future periods.
Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales and achieve profitability, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through public equity or debt financings, or collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties. Adequate funding may not be available to us when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our intellectual property, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we could be forced to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue our product development and/or commercialization plans, which would negatively and adversely affect our financial condition.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate significant revenue from net product sales we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels.
As of December 31, 2024, our aggregate cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $291.4 million – see the section below titled "

Impact of the Macroeconomic Environment
Recently, 
the economy has experienced downward pressure, and together with high rates of inflation and energy supply issues experienced in certain regions, 
war and geopolitical conflicts, 
have led to regional and/or global macroeconomic challenges, the effects of which may be of an extended duration.
In addition, we may be exposed to credit risk on deposits at financial institutions to the extent our account balances exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). We maintain cash held in deposit at financial institutions in the U.S. While these deposits are insured by the FDIC in an amount up to $250,000 for any depositor, to the extent we hold cash deposits in amounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limitation, we may incur a loss in the event of a failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain deposits. We invest our excess cash in highly liquid investments, including money market fund accounts, that are readily convertible into cash without penalty. We believe the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions and the types of accounts we hold, but we will continue to monitor regularly and adjust, if needed, to mitigate risk, including any ongoing or new events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions.
See the section titled "
Risk Factors
" for a further discussion of the potential adverse impact of unfavorable global and geopolitical economic conditions on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Components of our Results of Operations
Product Sales, Net
We recognize product sales, net when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery of the Company's product to the customer. We record the amount of revenue that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We apply the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance obligations, including whether they are capable of being distinct; (iii) measurement of the transaction 
101
Table of Content
price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.
We sell XDEMVY to customers in the U.S., which became available for commercial sale during the third quarter of 2023. We sell XDEMVY to a limited number of specialty pharmacies and distributors (i.e., its customers) who in turn sell it directly to clinics, hospitals, pharmacies and federal healthcare programs. Revenue from product sales is primarily recognized upon physical delivery of the product (when the customer obtains control of the product), in return for agreed-upon consideration. Shipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities rather than a separate performance obligation and are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or the transaction price, which may include fixed or variable consideration for (i) invoice discounts for prompt payment and distribution service fees, (ii) commercial and government rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, (iii) product returns and (iv) costs of co-pay assistance programs for patients, as well as other incentives. Estimates of variable consideration are calculated based on the actual product sales each reporting period and the nature of the variable consideration related to those sales. Where appropriate, we utilize the expected value method to determine the appropriate amount for estimates of variable consideration based on factors such as the current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in product sales, net only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. These estimates reflect our best estimate of the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled based on the terms of the contract. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ materially from estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect product sales, net and earnings in the period such variances are adjusted. We categorize product sales deduction estimates as follows:
Distribution Service Fees:
 We engage with wholesalers and specialty pharmacies to distribute our products to end customers. We pay the wholesalers and certain specialty pharmacies a fee for services such as: inventory management, chargeback administration, and service level commitments. We estimate the amount of distribution services fees to be paid to the customers and adjust the transaction price with the amount of such estimate at the time of sale to the customer. An accrued liability is recorded for unpaid distribution service fees.
Prompt Pay Discounts: 
We provide our customers with a percentage discount on their invoice if the customers pay within the agreed upon timeframe. We expect that our customers will earn prompt pay discounts. We estimate the probability of customers paying promptly based on the percentage of discount outlined in the purchase agreement between the two parties, and deduct the full amount of these discounts from gross product sales and accounts receivable at the time revenue is recognized. 
Product Returns: 
Our customers are contractually permitted to return the product within the contractual allowable time before and after the applicable expiration date. In the initial sales period, we estimate a provision for returns based on industry data and adjust the transaction price at the time of the product sale to the customer. Once sufficient history has been collected for product returns, we will utilize that history to inform our returns estimate. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed since it cannot be resold.
Chargebacks:
 A chargeback is the difference between our invoice price to the wholesaler and the wholesaler’s customer's contract price. The wholesaler tracks these sales and charges us back for the difference between the negotiated prices paid between the wholesaler's customers and the wholesaler's acquisition cost. We estimate the percentage of goods sold that are eligible for chargeback and adjust the transaction price and accounts receivable at the time of sale of the product to the customer.
Co-payment Assistance:
 Patients who meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co-payment assistance funded by the Company. We record contra-revenue for co-payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party administrators. An accrued liability is recorded on unredeemed co-payment assistance related to products for which control has been transferred to the customer.
Rebates:
 We accrue rebates for contractually agreed-upon discounts with commercial payers and mandated discounts under government programs such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program, and other government health care programs in the U.S. Our estimates for expected utilization of commercial payer rebates based on data received from our customers. The estimates for rebates under government programs are based on 
102
Table of Content
statutory discount rates and expected utilization as well as historical data we have accumulated since product launch. We calculate the accruals for commercial and government rebates based on various assumptions, including payer mix, with actual rebates potentially requiring accrual adjustments affecting product sales, net. Rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current period's activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior periods’ unpaid rebates. An accrued liability is recorded for unpaid rebates related to product for which control has transferred to the customer.
License Fees and Collaboration Revenue
License fees and collaboration revenue is primarily attributable to contractual milestones under the China Out-License. These amounts represent the contractual milestones achieved or allocated under the China Out-License that had been fully or partially completed by period end. These allocated amounts represented the satisfaction of the transfer of license rights to LianBio and GrandPharma and the completion of related performance obligations. License fees and collaboration revenue also includes the satisfaction of performance obligations under an existing clinical supply agreement. 
We will recognize additional license fees and collaboration revenue under the China Out-License to the extent other events occur, specifically related to (i) milestone achievement of an additional drug supply agreement execution, (ii) milestone achievement of certain regulatory events in the China Territory, and (iii) royalties and milestones from our licensee's product sales of TP-03 in the China Territory. As of the date of this filing, it is uncertain if and when we will receive any royalties or future milestone consideration under the China Out-License, including but not limited to the milestone achievement of an additional drug supply agreement execution.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales consists of direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of XDEMVY, including raw materials, third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight-in, third-party royalties payable on our product sales, net and amortization of capitalized intangible assets associated with XDEMVY. Cost of sales may also include period costs related to certain inventory warehouse and distribution operations and inventory adjustment charges. Prior to FDA approval of XDEMVY, manufacturing and other inventory costs were recorded to research and development expenses in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of December 31, 2024, we have sold materially all inventory that was recorded to research and development expense prior to FDA approval of XDEMVY.
Cost of License Fees and Collaboration Revenue
Cost of license fees and collaboration revenue includes the expense recognized under the terms of the China Out-License payable under the terms of our in-license agreement for lotilaner.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the development of our product candidates, including:
•
fees paid to third parties to conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf, including under agreements with CROs;
•
payments under licensing agreements, such as our upfront in-license fee for lotilaner;
•
consulting costs and certain allocated payroll, employee benefit and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation, salaries, payroll taxes) for personnel engaged in research and development functions;
•
costs related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements;
•
costs of procuring drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials; and
•
facilities expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent of our laboratory.
We expense both internal and external research and development expenses as incurred or as certain upfront or milestone payments become contractually due to licensors upon achievement of clinical or regulatory events. We recognize external research and development costs based on an evaluation of the progress-to-completion of (i) specific tasks performed or 
103
Table of Content
deliverables provided by CROs and CMOs and (ii) patient visits for dosing or other follow-up. To estimate period expense for recognition, we use information provided to us by our service providers and we then apply the corresponding fee schedule.
We track our external research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis, such as fees paid to CROs, CMOs, and research laboratories in connection with our pre-clinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. However, we do not currently track employee time on a program-by-program basis. Prior to commercialization of XDEMVY, the vast majority of our external and internal research and development expenses were attributable to the development of XDEMVY. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related costs including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and other personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, sales and marketing, and other administrative functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include sales and marketing costs to support our commercial launch starting in August 2023, consulting fees, legal services, rent and other facilities costs, patient assistance donations, the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee on Branded Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers, and other general operating expenses, not otherwise classified as research and development expenses.
We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase substantially in the future as a result of expanding our operations, including hiring personnel, continued commercialization of XDEMVY, preparing for potential commercialization of our other product candidates, and additional facility occupancy costs, as well as various incremental costs associated with being a public company, including: increased legal and accounting fees, regulatory costs associated with maintaining compliance with the rules of Nasdaq and SEC regulations, investor relations activities, directors and officers liability insurance premiums, and other accompanying compliance and governance costs.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net primarily consists of (i) interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, (ii) interest expense on the Credit Facilities, and (iii) the change in estimated fair value of the LianBio equity warrants and LianBio common stock we received as part of the China Out-License.

Product Sales, Net
Product sales, net increased by $165.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 to $180.1 million, as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by more than 163,000 bottles of XDEMVY dispensed to patients, compared to 17,400 bottles dispensed to patients in the prior year period. XDEMVY was approved by the FDA in July 2023 and was commercially launched in August 2023.
License Fees and Collaboration Revenue
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $2.9 million of license fees and collaboration revenue including (i) $2.5 million for the Termination Payment related to the Novation Agreement, and (ii) $0.4 million for the Warrant Termination Payment. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $2.7 million related to (i) the achievement of a $2.5 million contractual milestone under the China Out-License, and (ii) $0.2 million from the satisfaction of performance obligations under an existing clinical supply agreement. These allocated amounts represented the satisfaction of the transfer of license rights to LianBio and the completion of related performance obligations.
We will recognize additional license fees and collaboration revenue under the China Out-License to the extent other events occur, specifically related to (i) milestone achievement of regulatory events and/or patent issuance in the China Territory, and (ii) royalties and milestones from our licensee's product sales of TP-03 in the China Territory.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales increased by $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 to $12.8 million, as compared to the prior year period as a result of the increase in bottles of XDEMVY that were dispensed. Cost of sales consists of direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of XDEMVY, including raw materials, third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, and freight-in, as well as third-party royalties payable on our product sales, net and amortization of capitalized intangible assets associated with XDEMVY.

Research and development expenses increased by $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 to $53.4 million, as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to (i) $3.5 million of increased indirect expenses related to payroll and personnel-related costs (including increased stock-based compensation expense of $1.0 million) for employee additions to drive our product development initiatives, (ii) $0.7 million of increased other indirect expenses, (iii) a $1.5 million increase in milestone expense related to our in-license agreements (see 
Note 9
), and (iv) $1.2 million of increased TP-03 program expenses. These increases were partially offset by (i) $2.7 million of decreased TP-05 program expenses including $1.5 million for the food effect study and $1.2 million for the Carpo trial, and (ii) a $1.2 million decrease in TP-04 program expenses related to completion of the Galatea trial.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $128.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, to $237.3 million as compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to (i) $39.7 million of increased payroll and personnel-related costs (including increased stock-based compensation expense of $6.6 million) for commercial and corporate employee additions to support our business growth and commercial leadership hires for XDEMVY, (ii) $52.0 million of increased commercial and marketing costs as we continued our commercial expansion of XDEMVY, (iii) $36.8 million of increased information technology applications, legal, professional and other corporate expenses. Our field sales headcount and associated vendor expenses continued to increase during 2024 due to further growth and expansion of our commercial activities for XDEMVY. XDEMVY was approved by the FDA in July 2023 and was commercially launched in August 2023.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net decreased by $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 due to (i) $1.9 million of loss on debt extinguishment related to the termination of our 2022 Credit Facility (defined below), (ii) $4.5 million of increased interest expense related to the Credit Facilities, (iii) a $0.9 million decrease related to the change in fair value of the LianBio common stock sold in June, and (iv) a $0.3 million decrease related to the change in fair value related to the final mark-to-market adjustment on the unvested third tranche equity warrant. These decreases were partially offset by (i) $4.7 million of increased interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and (ii) $0.7 million of dividend income from LianBio.

Overview
Since our inception, we have financed our operations substantially through private placements of preferred stock, net proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our IPO, Follow-on Public Offerings, and the 2023 ATM Prospectus, as well as proceeds from product sales, net, the China Out-License, and drawdowns from our Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $291.4 million.
Follow-On Public Offerings
In August 2023, we completed the August 2023 Public Offering in which 5,714,285 shares of our common stock were sold at a public offering price of $17.50 per share. In September 2023, the underwriters partially exercised an option to purchase an additional 355,164 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $17.50 per share. After giving effect to the exercise of the underwriters' option, we sold a total of 6,069,449 shares and received aggregate net proceeds of $99.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering-related expenses.
In February 2024, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 ASR (the "2024 Shelf Registration Statement"). In March 2024 we completed the March 2024 Public Offering. The 2024 Public Offering was an underwritten follow-on public offering under the 2024 Shelf Registration Statement, pursuant to which we sold 2,812,500 shares of our common stock, and, in lieu of common stock to a certain investor, pre-funded warrants to purchase 312,500 shares of our common stock. The price to the public was $32.00 per share and $31.9999 per pre-funded warrant, which was the price to the public of each share of common stock sold in the March 2024 Public Offering, minus the $0.0001 exercise price per pre-funded warrant. We also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 468,750 additional shares of its common stock at the public offering price of $32.00 per share, which the underwriters exercised in full in March 2024. We received $107.7 million in aggregate net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other estimated offering-related expenses.
Open Market Sales Agreement
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 1,000,000 shares of our common stock for $20.00 per share under a sales agreement prospectus filed in November 2023, pursuant to the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement (defined below) covering the sale of up to $100.0 million of our common stock pursuant to the 2023 ATM Prospectus with Jefferies LLC ("Jefferies"). This resulted in net proceeds of $19.2 million, after deducting broker commissions and offering related expenses.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, there were no sales of our common stock pursuant to the 2023 ATM Prospectus.
China Out-License
As of the date of this filing, we have received $86.1 million of total proceeds in connection with our China Out-License comprised of (i) $15.0 million of initial consideration, (ii) $67.5 million for the achievement of specified milestones, (iii) $0.7 million related to a special cash dividend, (iv) $2.5 million related to the Novation Agreement, and (v) $0.4 million related to the Warrant Termination Agreement.
As of December 31, 2024 we are eligible to receive further consideration from GrandPharma upon the achievement of additional TP-03 events, including: (i) $20.0 million of potential future regulatory and/or patent milestones; (ii) $100.0 million of potential future China-based TP-03 sales threshold milestones; and (iii) tiered low-to-high-teen royalties for China Territory TP-03 product sales.
Credit Facilities
In February 2022, we executed the Credit Facility with Hercules Capital, Inc. and SVB (the "2022 Credit Facility"). Concurrent with the execution of the 2022 Credit Facility we drew $20.0 million. The 2022 Credit Facility was amended in January 2023 and August 2023. The Credit Facility, as amended, set a maximum interest rate, updated the terms of prepayment and included an extended period to drawdown the tranche associated with the NDA submission. During 2023, we made two 
107
Table of Content
separate draws for an aggregate of $10.0 million from the $25.0 million tranche associated with the NDA submission of TP-03. We did not incur lender fees as part of the 2022 Credit Facility.
In April 2024, we executed the 2024 Credit Facility with Pharmakon with maturity in April 2029 (collectively, with the 2022 Credit Facility, the “Credit Facilities”). The 2024 Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Company's presently existing and subsequently acquired assets. Upon execution, we made a $75.0 million draw from the initial tranche, a portion of which was utilized to repay all outstanding indebtedness associated with the 2022 Credit Facility, for total net proceeds of $39.6 million. The 2024 Credit Facility provides for three potential additional term loan tranches in principal amounts up to $25.0 million, $50.0 million, and $50.0 million, respectively, subject to customary conditions to funding and, in the case of the last two tranches, achieving minimum net sales milestones. The three additional tranches may be requested on or prior to December 31, 2024, June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2025, respectively.
The 2024 Credit Facility bears interest at a floating rate based upon the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), plus a margin of 6.75% per annum. The SOFR is subject to a 3.75% floor. The 2024 Credit Facility contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants in each case. There is also no warrant coverage to the lenders and no financial covenants associated with the financing.
Funding Requirements
Liquidity 
Our operating expenditures currently consist of cost of sales, research and development costs (including activities within our preclinical, clinical, regulatory, and drug manufacturing initiatives) and selling, general and administrative costs. Our use of cash is impacted by the timing and extent of payments for each of these activities and other business requirements. We have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of $360.2 million and $244.7 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $291.4 million as of December 31, 2024 is sufficient to fund our current and planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We also have additional availability from our 2024 Credit Facility of $100.0 million contingent on maintaining certain sales milestones. Our cash runway estimate is predicated on current assumptions for future revenue, operating expenses, and debt availability and may require future adjustments. Accordingly, we may be required to raise additional capital earlier than we currently expect based on our cash requirements and market dynamics.
Shelf Registration Statements
In February 2024, we filed the 2024 Shelf Registration Statement, which permits us to offer and sell from time to time, in one or more series of issuances and on terms that we will determine at the time of the offering, our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, units or any combination of such securities.
In November 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC on November 21, 2023, (the "2023 Shelf Registration Statement"), which replaced the November 2021 Shelf Registration Statement, as defined below, and permits us to offer up to $300.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings and in any combination, including in units from time to time.
As part of the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement, we concurrently filed the 2023 ATM Prospectus with Jefferies covering the sale of up to $100.0 million of our common stock pursuant to an Open Market Sales Agreement
TM
 we entered into with Jefferies in 2021 (the "ATM Sales Agreement"). Under the terms of the 2023 ATM Prospectus and ATM Sales Agreement, Jefferies will act as the Company's sales agent and is entitled to compensation for its services equal to 3% of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold. We have not sold any shares of our common stock under the 2023 ATM Prospectus during the year ended December 31, 2024. In December 2023, we sold 1,000,000 shares of our common stock under the 2023 ATM Prospectus for $20.00 per share and received net proceeds of $19.2 million, after deducting broker commission and offering-related expenses.
In November 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the SEC on November 5, 2021 (the “2021 Shelf Registration Statement”), which permitted us to offer up to $300.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings and in any combination, including in units from time to time. The 2023 Shelf Registration Statement replaced the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement.
108
Table of Content
Also, as part of the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement, we concurrently filed a sales agreement prospectus (the “2021 ATM Prospectus”) covering the sale of up to $100.0 million of our common stock pursuant to an Open Market Sale Agreement
TM
.

We did not sell any shares of our common stock under the 2021 ATM Prospectus. In July 2023, in connection with the August 2023 Public Offering, we terminated the sales agreement prospectus relating to the 2021 ATM Prospectus.
Other Liquidity Risks
We expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future, and for these losses to further increase, as we expand our clinical development programs for our other product candidates and continue to commercialize XDEMVY. We may also encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other currently unknown factors that could adversely affect our business.
We may require additional capital to fully develop our product candidates and to execute our business strategy. Our requirements of a future capital raise will depend on many factors, including:
•
the amount of revenue received from commercial sales of XDEMVY or our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;
•
the cost and timing associated with commercializing XDEMVY or our product candidates, if they receive marketing approval;
•
the scope, timing, rate of progress and costs of our drug discovery efforts, preclinical development activities, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates;
•
the number and scope of clinical programs we decide to pursue;
•
the cost, timing and outcome of preparing for and undergoing regulatory review of our product candidates;
•
the scope and costs of development and commercial manufacturing activities;
•
the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration agreements we might have at such time;
•
the availability of our 2024 Credit Facility;
•
the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;
•
the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;
•
our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;
•
our efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the development of our product candidates and, ultimately, the sale of our products, following FDA approval;
•
our implementation of various computerized information systems;
•
impact of health epidemics on our clinical development or operations; and
•
the costs associated with being a public company.
A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we will continue to require additional capital to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. Any future debt financing into which we enter may impose upon us additional covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay 
109
Table of Content
dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments or engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders.
Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our potential inability to raise capital when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. If we are unable to raise additional funds as required, we may need to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all development programs and clinical trials. We may also be required to sell or license our rights to product candidates in certain territories or indications that we would otherwise prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves. If we are required to enter into collaborations and other arrangements to address our liquidity needs, we may have to give up certain rights that limit our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates or may have other terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial prospects. See the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Risk Factors” for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
We have entered into arrangements that contractually obligate us to make payments that will affect our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Such arrangements include those related to the contractual obligations described below:
Lease Commitments
Our operating lease commitments reflect payments due for our active lease agreements in Irvine, California, for adjacent office and laboratory suites. In December 2024, we entered into a lease agreement for office space located in Irvine, California for a 10-year lease term. The lease payments are expected to commence in late 2025 following the earlier of: (i) eleven months following the lease execution date, or (ii) the date the Company commences its regular business activities at the premises following completion of tenant improvements. The base rent for the first year of the lease will be approximately $2.5 million and is subject to annual increases of 3% thereafter. The Company is entitled to an abatement of base rent for the first five full calendar months from the beginning of the lease commencement date for an aggregate amount of $0.7 million. As of December 31, 2024, our contractual commitments for our leases were $0.8 million, which will be paid over the remaining lease term of 0.8 years.
Purchase Obligations
As of December 31, 2024, we have entered into manufacturing supply agreements for the commercial supply of XDEMVY. These amounts do not represent all of our anticipated purchases, but instead represent the contractually obligated minimum purchases or firm commitments of non-cancelable minimum amounts, as follows:

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $83.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, which primarily consisted of our net loss of $115.6 million, partially offset by net increases in non-cash and other charges of $28.7 million and net operating assets and liabilities of $3.8 million. The increase in net non-cash and other charges were primarily related to stock-based compensation expense of $27.8 million and a loss on debt extinguishment of $1.9 million. The increase in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to cash increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of $40.3 million and $2.6 million of accrued payroll and benefits, partially offset by cash decreases including $30.1 million of accounts receivable, $7.0 million of prepaid expenses, and $2.0 million of inventory.
Net cash used in operating activities was $117.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which primarily consisted of our net loss of $135.9 million, partially offset by net increases in non-cash and other charges of $18.1 million and net operating assets and liabilities of $0.3 million. The increase in net non-cash and other charges primarily related to stock-based compensation of $19.8 million. The increase in net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to cash increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of $13.2 million, accrued payroll and benefits of $7.7 million, partially offset by cash decreases including $16.6 million of account receivables, $2.9 million of prepaid expenses, and $0.7 million of other non-current assets.
Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $199.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and consisted of (i) $262.6 million of purchased marketable securities, (ii) $3.0 million of purchased long-term investments, (iii) $5.0 million of intangible asset additions, and (iv) $1.6 million of purchased property, plant and equipment. These cash decreases were partially offset by $73.0 million of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $140.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, 
and consisted of 
$174.8 million

of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by (i) $28.7 million of purchased marketable securities, (ii) $4.0 million of intangible asset additions, and (iii) $1.5 million of purchased property, plant and equipment.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $154.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and consisted of (i) $98.3 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our March 2024 Public Offering, (ii) $9.4 million from the issuance of pre-funded warrants related to the March 2024 Public Offering, (iii) $75.0 million of proceeds from an initial draw against our 2024 Credit Facility, (iv) $5.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of vested employee stock options, and (v) $1.8 million of proceeds from our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). These increases to cash were partially offset by $31.9 million of debt extinguishment payments on the 2022 Credit Facility and $3.5 million of cash paid for loan issuance costs on the 2024 Credit Facility.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $130.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and consisted of (i) $99.4 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our August 2023 Public Offering, (ii) $19.2 million of net proceeds from common stock sold under the 2023 ATM Prospectus, (iii) $10.0 million of proceeds from our 2022 Credit Facility, (iv) $1.0 million of proceeds from our ESPP, and (v) $0.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of vested employee stock options.
For a discussion of the statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, please refer to Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024.

Table of Content
Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments and Use of Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements, as well as the reported revenue earned and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Historically, revisions to our estimates have not resulted in a material change to the financial statements.
While our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements also included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe this critical accounting policy is the most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
Rebates
We accrue rebates for contractually agreed-upon discounts with commercial payers and mandated discounts under government programs such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program, and other government health care programs in the U.S. Our estimates for expected utilization of commercial payer rebates are based on data received from our customers. The estimates for rebates under government programs are based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization as well as historical data we have accumulated since product launch. We calculate the accruals for commercial and government rebates based on various assumptions, including payer mix, with actual rebates potentially requiring accrual adjustments affecting product sales, net. Rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current period's activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior periods’ unpaid rebates. If actual rebates vary from estimates, we may need to adjust accruals, which would affect product sales, net in the period of adjustment. An accrued liability is recorded for unpaid rebates related to product for which control has transferred to the customer.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in the notes to which they relate within our financial statements.
Indemnification Agreements
As permitted under Delaware law and in accordance with our bylaws, we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving in such capacity. We are also party to indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. We believe the fair value of the indemnification rights and agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have not recorded any liabilities for these indemnification rights and agreements as of December 31, 2024.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
The market risk inherent in our financial instruments and in our financial position represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $291.4 million, consisting of interest-bearing money market accounts, for which the fair market value would be affected by changes in the general level of United States interest rates. However, due to the short-term maturities and the low-risk profile of our investments, an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had $75.0 million of debt principal outstanding. Our 2024 Credit Facility accrues interest at a floating rate based upon the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), plus a margin of 6.75% per annum. The SOFR is subject to a 3.75% floor. As a result, we are exposed to risks related to our indebtedness from changes in interest rates. We do not believe that a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate would have had a significant impact on our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Inflation, interest rate changes, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations did not have a significant impact on our results of operations for any periods presented herein. However, with further inflationary pressures, certain significant increased costs could have an adverse impact on the results of our operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Accrued Commercial and Government Rebates Impacted by Estimated Payer Mix
Description of the Matter
As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, where appropriate, the Company utilizes the expected value method to estimate variable consideration based on factors such as current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The Company accrues variable consideration for rebates for contractually agreed-upon discounts with commercial payers and mandated discounts under government programs such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program, and other government health care programs in the U.S. The Company calculates the accruals for commercial and government rebates based on various assumptions, including payer mix, with actual rebates potentially requiring accrual adjustments affecting net product sales. 
Auditing the Company’s estimated payer mix used in the calculation of the accrued commercial and government rebates was especially challenging because it involved subjective management assumptions based on variability of rebates with commercial payers and government programs. Changes in the payer mix assumptions could have a material impact on the accrued commercial and government rebates.

To test management’s payer mix assumptions, our audit procedures included, among others, comparing management’s estimate to our independently developed expectation based on historical results and inquiring of sales and marketing personnel. We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of changes in management’s estimated payer mix on the accrued commercial and government rebates. Additionally, we compared the accrued rebates, based on the estimated payer mix, to actual rebate invoices received in the subsequent period.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(all tabular amounts presented in thousands, except share, per share, per unit, and number of years)
1. 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Description of Business
Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Tarsus” or the “Company”) is a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics, starting with eye care. The Company launched XDEMVY
® 
(lotilaner ophthalmic solution) 0.25%, formerly known as TP-03, for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis, in August 2023, after receiving United States ("U.S.") Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") approval in July 2023. 
Follow-On Public Offerings
In February 2024, the Company filed an automatic shelf registration on Form S-3 ASR (the "2024 Shelf Registration Statement"). In March 2024, the Company completed an underwritten follow-on public offering under the 2024 Shelf Registration Statement of 
2,812,500
 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share, and, in lieu of common stock to a certain investor, pre-funded warrants to purchase 
312,500
 shares of its common stock (the “March 2024 Public Offering”). The price to the public was $
32.00
 per share and $
31.9999
 per pre-funded warrant, which was the price to the public of each share of common stock sold in the March 2024 Public Offering, minus the $
0.0001
 exercise price per pre-funded warrant. The pre-funded warrants are exercisable, subject to certain beneficial ownership restrictions, at any time after their original issuance and will not expire; as of December 31, 2024, 
312,500
 of pre-funded warrants are exercisable. The Company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 
468,750
 additional shares of its common stock at the public offering price of $
32.00
 per share, which the underwriters exercised in full and was completed in March 2024. The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company were $
107.7
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other estimated offering-related expenses.
In August 2023, the Company completed a follow-on public offering under its shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the "2021 Shelf Registration Statement") of 
5,714,285
 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $
17.50
 per share. In September 2023, the underwriters partially exercised the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares resulting in the Company's issuance of an additional 
355,164
 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $
17.50
 per share. The aggregate net proceeds received by the Company were $
99.3
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering-related expenses. 
In November 2023, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on November 21, 2023, (the "2023 Shelf Registration Statement"), which replaced the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement and permits the Company to offer up to $
300.0
 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants in one or more offerings and in any combination, including in units from time to time.
In May 2022, the Company completed a follow-on public offering under the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement for an initial underwritten sale of 
5,600,000
 shares of its common stock at the public offering price of $
13.50
 per share. The Company also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 
840,000
 additional shares of its common stock at the public offering price, which the underwriters partially exercised in June 2022 for an additional 
289,832
 shares at the public offering price of $
13.50
 per share. Total aggregate net proceeds received by the Company were $
74.2
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering-related expenses.
Open Market Sales Agreement
As part of the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement, the Company concurrently filed a sales agreement prospectus covering the sale of up to $
100.0
 million of common stock pursuant to an Open Market Sale Agreement (the "2023 ATM Prospectus") with Jefferies LLC ("Jefferies"), which replaced the November 1, 2021 Open market Sale Agreement
TM
 (the "2021 ATM Prospectus"). Under the terms of the 2023 ATM Prospectus, Jefferies will act as the Company's sales agent and is entitled to compensation for its services equal to 
3
% of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold.

TARSUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(all tabular amounts presented in thousands, except share, per share, per unit, and number of years)
During the year ended December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 sales of the Company's common stock pursuant to the 2023 ATM Prospectus. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold 
1,000,000
 shares of common stock under the 2023 ATM Prospectus for net proceeds of $
19.2
 million, after deducting broker commissions and offering-related expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, there were 
no
 sales of the Company's common stock pursuant to the 2021 ATM Prospectus.
Liquidity
The Company has a limited operating history, limited history of product sales and has accumulated losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. The Company has funded its inception-to-date operations through the Initial Public Offering ("IPO"), subsequent follow-on public offerings, and the 2023 ATM Prospectus, as well as from proceeds from product sales, the development and license agreement (the "China Out-License"), and draws on the current loan and security agreement (the "2024 Credit Facility") with Pharmakon Advisors, LP ("Pharmakon") and the previous loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. ("Hercules") and Silicon Valley Bank, a division of First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company ("SVB") (collectively, the "Credit Facilities").

The Company estimates that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet projected operating expense requirements and other liquidity needs for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the accompanying Financial Statements that have been prepared on a going-concern basis.
The Company plans to fund its operations, capital funding and other liquidity needs using existing cash and investments and, to the extent available, cash generated from commercial operations. Management expects the Company to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may be required to raise additional capital to fund its ongoing operations. However, no assurance can be given as to whether financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds as required, it may need to delay, reduce, or terminate some or all of its development programs and clinical trials. The Company may also be required to sell or license its rights to product candidates in certain territories or indications that it would otherwise prefer to develop and commercialize on its own and/or enter into collaborations and other arrangements to address its liquidity needs, which could materially and adversely affect its business and financial prospects, or even its ability to remain a going concern.

2. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES
Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the U.S. and with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and with the rules and regulations of the SEC requires management to make informed estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these accompanying Financial Statements and Notes. These estimates and assumptions are based upon historical experience, knowledge of current events and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources and involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and may materially differ from the amounts ultimately realized and reported due to the inherent uncertainty of any estimate or assumption. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates including those related to the recognition of revenue, clinical trial accruals, contract manufacturing accruals, expected demand for inventory, fair value of assets and liabilities, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other market-specific and relevant assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the accompanying Financial Statements under different assumptions and conditions. 
The Company’s Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 reflect the Company’s estimates of the impact of the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, including the impact of inflation, interest rates, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The duration and the scope of these conditions cannot be predicted; therefore, the extent to which these conditions will directly or indirectly impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, is uncertain. The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates, judgments and assumptions or a revision of the carrying value of the Company’s assets or liabilities as of the issuance date of the accompanying Financial Statements.

Table of Contents
TARSUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(all tabular amounts presented in thousands, except share, per share, per unit, and number of years)
The accounting policies and estimates that most significantly impact the presented amounts within these accompanying Financial Statements are further described below:
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits and highly liquid investments, including money market fund accounts, that are readily convertible into cash without penalty, with original maturities of three months or less from the purchase date. The carrying amounts reported in the accompanying Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents are valued at cost, which approximate their fair value.

Restricted Cash
As of December 31, 2024, the Company held $
2.6
 million of restricted cash as collateral for a letter of credit related to the Company's new office space lease that was executed in December 2024 (see 
Note 9
). The restricted cash will be held for longer than one year and is reported in non-current assets on the accompanying Balance Sheet.
Marketable Securities and Long-Term Investments
Marketable securities consist primarily of short-term fixed income investments carried at estimated fair value as determined based upon quoted market prices or pricing models for similar securities (see

). Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in fixed income securities at the time of purchase. Available-for-sale securities with original maturities beyond three months at the date of purchase, including those that have maturity dates beyond one year from the balance sheet date, are classified as current assets on the accompanying Balance Sheets due to their highly liquid nature and availability for use in current operations.
Marketable securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within the accompanying Statements of Stockholders' Equity until realized. The Company periodically evaluates whether declines in fair values of its available-for-sale securities below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as the Company’s ability and intent to hold the available-for-sale security until a forecasted recovery occurs. The cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion, as well as interest and dividends, are included in interest income. Realized gains and losses as well as credit losses, if any, on marketable securities identified on a specific identification basis are included in other income (expense) in the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The Company evaluates the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers during the period. To date, the Company has not identified any other-than-temporary declines in fair value of its investments and no credit losses associated with credit risk have occurred or have been recorded. Interest earned on marketable securities is included in interest income within the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
In April 2024, the Company made a preferred stock investment in a privately-held eye care company which does not meet the criteria for in-substance common stock. This preferred stock investment is included in long-term investments in the accompanying Balance Sheet given the Company's intent to hold these securities for longer than one year. In accordance with the measurement alternative under the Accounting Standards Codification 321,
 Investments— Equity Securities
, at each subsequent reporting period the Company records its preferred stock investment at cost, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar equity financings at each subsequent reporting period. In addition, at each subsequent reporting period the Company will assess for possible impairment indicators. If the Company determines that the preferred stock fair value is less than its carrying value, it will recognize an impairment loss through other income (expense) on the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of December 31, 2024, there have been no observable transactions or impairment indicators that would result in a change to the fair value of the Company's preferred stock investment. As of December 31, 2023, there were no preferred stock investments.
As of December 31, 2023, the LianBio common stock was classified as long-term investments due to the Company's intent at that time to hold these shares for longer than one year. These equity securities were designated as

available-for-sale with associated unrealized gains or losses reported in other income (expense) within the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable generally consists of amounts due from the Company's customers, which includes pharmaceutical wholesalers and specialty pharmacy providers related to product sales of XDEMVY in the U.S. Payment terms are typically 30-60 days following delivery to customers. Accounts receivable are recorded net of discounts, chargebacks, allowances and other adjustments. The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers so it can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses based on existing contractual payment terms, actual payment patterns of customers and individual customer circumstances. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the reserve when it is probable that the receivable will not be collected. The Company did not record a reserve for estimated credit losses as of and during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Inventory
Inventories include the costs of material, third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, and freight-in. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.

Inventory is measured at the lower-of-cost and net realizable value, based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, damage, expiration, or changes in price level.
The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Product that may be used in clinical development programs are excluded from inventory and the costs are charged to research and development expense in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as incurred, as long as they do not have an alternative use. Prior to FDA approval of XDEMVY in July 2023, costs related to the production of such inventory were recorded as research and development expense on the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss in the period incurred. The Company evaluates inventory levels that would be sold within one year. The portion of inventory that is not expected to be sold or used within one year is classified as inventory, non-current in the accompanying Balance Sheet.

Intangible Assets, Net
Intangible assets are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date or, in the case of commercial milestone payments, the date they become due. The evaluation of intangible assets includes assessing the amortization period for which the asset is expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the Company. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, primarily on a straight-line basis when the Company is unable to reliably estimate the pattern of cash flow. 
The carrying value of intangible assets as a result of achieving certain commercial milestones was $
8.3
 million and $
3.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Intangible assets are amortized to cost of sales over the remaining useful life of 
8.7
 years as of December 31, 2024, with an initial useful life of 
10
 years from the date of first commercial sale (see 
Note 9
). Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $
0.5
 million and $
0.1
 million, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $
0.7
 million and $
0.1

no
 intangible assets or amortization expense as of and during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Long-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be fully recoverable. To do so, the Company compares the carrying value of the intangible asset to the undiscounted net cash flows over its remaining useful life, and if not recoverable, will estimate the fair value of the asset. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. There have been 
no
 impairments of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:
•
Level 1:
 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are publicly accessible at the measurement date.
•
Level 2:
 Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but that are corroborated by market data. These inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted market prices in markets that are not active to the general public.
•
Level 3:
 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The carrying amounts for financial instruments consisting of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturities for each. The Company's equity warrant holdings disclosed as other assets are carried at fair value based on unobservable market inputs (see 
Note 3
).
Assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. The Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain assets or liabilities within the fair value hierarchy. The Company did not have any transfers of assets and liabilities between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the years presented.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment, net are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets that range from 
three
 to 
five years
. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of 
125

(all tabular amounts presented in thousands, except share, per share, per unit, and number of years)
related improvements. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its property and equipment, net whenever events or changes in circumstances of the business indicate that the asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over the remaining useful lives of the assets. If a long-lived asset fails a recoverability test, the Company measures the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. There were no impairments recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception and evaluates each lease agreement to determine whether the lease is an operating or finance lease. Right-of-use assets (“ROU assets”) represent the Company’s right to control an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the initial non-cancelable lease term, unless there is a renewal option that is reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date in determining the discount rate utilized to present value the future minimum lease payments since an implicit interest rate in each at-market lease agreement was not determinable. Lease expense for the Company's operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company's variable lease costs, consisting primarily of real estate taxes, insurance costs, and common area maintenance, are expensed as incurred and excluded from the reported ROU assets and lease liabilities amounts presented in the accompanying Balance Sheets. The current and noncurrent portion of the operating lease liability are included in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying Balance Sheets. Rent expense is allocated to research and development and general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Concentration Risk
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash held on deposit at financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") in an amount up to $250,000 for any depositor. To the extent the Company holds cash deposits in amounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limitation, it may incur a loss in the event of a failure of any of the financial institutions where it maintains deposits. The Company invests its excess cash in highly liquid investments, including money market fund accounts, that are readily convertible into cash without penalty. 
Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions, but will continue to monitor regularly and adjust, if needed, to mitigate risk, including any ongoing or new events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions. The Company has established guidelines regarding diversification of its investments and their maturities, which are designed to maintain principal and maximize liquidity. To date, the Company has not experienced any losses associated with this credit risk and continues to assess that this exposure is not significant.
Major Customers
The Company enters into agreements with certain limited specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors for the sale of XDEMVY in the U.S. Major customers are defined as customers that individually accounted for greater than 10% of the

 The Company believes that the concentration of credit risk in its accounts receivable is mitigated by its credit evaluation process, relatively short collection terms, and the level of credit worthiness of its customers.
Major Suppliers
The Company does not currently own manufacturing facilities and depends on an outsourced manufacturing strategy for the production of XDEMVY for commercial use and for the production of its other product candidates for clinical trials. The Company enters into agreements with third-party manufacturers that are approved for the commercial production of XDEMVY and third-party suppliers that are approved for XDEMVY's active pharmaceutical ingredient. Although there are potential sources of supply other than the Company's existing manufacturers and suppliers, any new supplier would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements. The loss of certain manufacturers and third-party suppliers could result in a temporary disruption of the Company’s commercialization efforts.
Revenue Recognition
(i) Product Sales, Net
The Company recognizes product sales, net when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery of the Company's product to the customer. The Company records the amount of revenue that reflects the consideration that it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods are performance obligations, including whether they are capable of being distinct; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company sells XDEMVY to customers in the U.S., which became available for commercial sale during the third quarter of 2023. The Company sells XDEMVY to a limited number of specialty pharmacies and distributors (i.e., its 
127

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(all tabular amounts presented in thousands, except share, per share, per unit, and number of years)
customers) who in turn sell it directly to clinics, hospitals, pharmacies and federal healthcare programs. Revenue from product sales is primarily recognized upon physical delivery of the product (when the customer obtains control of the product), in return for agreed-upon consideration. Shipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities rather than a separate performance obligation and are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or the transaction price, which may include fixed or variable consideration for (i) invoice discounts for prompt payment and distribution service fees, (ii) commercial and government rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, (iii) product returns and (iv) costs of co-pay assistance programs for patients, as well as other incentives. Estimates of variable consideration are calculated based on the actual product sales each reporting period and the nature of the variable consideration related to those sales. Where appropriate, the Company utilizes the expected value method to determine the appropriate amount for estimates of variable consideration based on factors such as the current contractual and statutory discount rates, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in product sales, net only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. These estimates reflect the Company’s best estimate of the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled based on the terms of the contract. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ materially from estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, the Company will adjust these estimates, which would affect product sales, net and earnings in the period such variances are adjusted. The Company categorizes product sales deduction estimates as follows:
Distribution Service Fees:
 The Company engages with wholesalers and specialty pharmacies to distribute its products to end customers. The Company pays the wholesalers and certain specialty pharmacies a fee for services such as: inventory management, chargeback administration, and service level commitments. The Company estimates the amount of distribution services fees to be paid to the customers and adjusts the transaction price with the amount of such estimate at the time of sale to the customer. An accrued liability is recorded for unpaid distribution service fees.
Prompt Pay Discounts: 
The Company provides its customers with a percentage discount on their invoice if the customers pay within the agreed upon timeframe. The Company expects that its customers will earn prompt pay discounts. The Company estimates the probability of customers paying promptly based on the percentage of discount outlined in the purchase agreement between the two parties, and deducts the full amount of these discounts from gross product sales and accounts receivable at the time revenue is recognized. 
Product Returns: 
The Company's customers are contractually permitted to return the product within the contractual allowable time before and after the applicable expiration date. In the initial sales period, the Company estimates its provision for returns based on industry data and adjusts the transaction price at the time of the product sale to the customer. Once sufficient history has been collected for product returns, the Company will utilize that history to inform its returns estimate. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed since it cannot be resold.
Chargebacks:
 A chargeback is the difference between the Company's invoice price to the wholesaler and the wholesaler’s customer's contract price. The wholesaler tracks these sales and charges back the Company for the difference between the negotiated prices paid between the wholesaler's customers and the wholesaler's acquisition cost. The Company estimates the percentage of goods sold that are eligible for chargeback and adjusts the transaction price and accounts receivable at the time of sale of the product to the customer.
Co-payment Assistance:
 Patients who meet certain eligibility requirements may receive co-payment assistance funded by the Company. The Company records contra-revenue for co-payment assistance based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party administrators. An accrued liability is recorded on unredeemed co-payment assistance related to products for which control has been transferred to the customer.
Rebates:
 The Company accrues rebates for contractually agreed-upon discounts with commercial payers and mandated discounts under government programs such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program, and other government health care programs in the U.S. The Company's estimates for expected utilization of 
128
Table of Contents
TARSUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(all tabular amounts presented in thousands, except share, per share, per unit, and number of years)
commercial payer rebates are based on data received from its customers. The estimates for rebates under government programs are based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization as well as historical data the Company has accumulated since product launch. The Company calculates the accruals for commercial and government rebates based on various assumptions, including payer mix, with actual rebates potentially requiring accrual adjustments affecting product sales, net. Rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current period's activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior periods’ unpaid rebates. If actual rebates vary from estimates, the Company may need to adjust accruals, which would affect product sales, net in the period of adjustment. An accrued liability is recorded for unpaid rebates related to product for which control has transferred to the customer.
(ii) License Fees and Collaboration Revenue
China Out-License 
License fees and collaboration revenue in the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss have historically related to the China Out-License that allows the third-party licensee to market the Company's TP-03 product candidate (representing functional intellectual property) in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (the "China Territory")— see 
Note 10
. The accounting and reporting of revenue for out-license arrangements requires significant judgment for: (a) identification of the number of performance obligations within the contract; (b) the contract’s transaction price for allocation (including variable consideration); (c) the stand-alone selling price for each identified performance obligation; and (d) the timing and amount of revenue recognition in each period. 
The China Out-License was analyzed under GAAP to determine whether the promised goods or services are distinct or must be accounted for as part of a combined performance obligation. In making these assessments, the Company considers factors such as the stage of development of the underlying intellectual property and the capabilities of the customer to develop the intellectual property on their own, and/or whether the required expertise is readily available. If the license is not distinct, the license is combined with other promised goods or services as a combined performance obligation for revenue recognition.
The China Out-License arrangement included the following forms of consideration: (i) non-refundable upfront license payment; (ii) equity-based consideration; (iii) sales-based royalties; (iv) sales-based threshold milestones; (v) one-time payment for executing a drug supply agreement; (vi) development milestone payments; (vii) regulatory milestone payments and the issuance of a related patent; and (viii) a one-time termination payment to transition the rights to develop and commercialize TP-03 in China for the treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis and Meibomian Gland Disease ("MGD") to Xi An Grand Chang An Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. ("GrandPharma"). Revenue is recognized in proportion to the allocated transaction price when (or as) the respective performance obligation is satisfied. The Company evaluates the progress related to each milestone at each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the probability of achievement and related revenue recognition. The measure of progress, and thereby periods over which revenue is recognized, is subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the agreement.
Contractual Terms for Receipt of Payments
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service and is the unit of accounting. A contract’s transaction price is allocated among each distinct performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price and recognized when, or as, the applicable performance obligation is satisfied.
The contractual terms that establish the Company’s right to collect specified amounts from its customers and that require contemporaneous evaluation and documentation under GAAP for the corresponding timing and amount of revenue recognition, are as follows: 

Upfront License Fees:
 The Company determines whether non-refundable license fee consideration is recognized at the time of contract execution (i.e., when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license) or over the actual (or implied) contractual period of the China Out-License.

The Company also evaluates whether it has any other requirements to provide substantive services that are inseparable from the performance obligation of the license transfer to determine whether any combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. 
129
Table of Contents
TARSUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(all tabular amounts presented in thousands, except share, per share, per unit, and number of years)
Upfront payments may require deferral of revenue recognition to a future period until the Company performs obligations under these arrangements.
Development Milestones:

The Company utilizes the most likely amount method to estimate the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled for achievement of development milestones as these represent variable consideration. For those payments based on development milestones (e.g., patient dosing in a clinical study or the achievement of statistically significant clinical results), the Company assesses the probability that the milestone will be achieved, including its ability to control the timing or likelihood of achievement, and any associated revenue constraint. Given the high degree of uncertainty around the occurrence of these events, the Company determines the milestone and other contingent amounts to be constrained until the uncertainty associated with these payments is resolved. At each reporting period, the Company re-evaluates this associated revenue recognition constraint. Any resulting adjustments are recorded to revenue on a cumulative catch-up basis, and reflected in the financial statements in the period of adjustment. 
Regulatory Milestones:
 The Company utilizes the most likely amount method to estimate the consideration to which it will be entitled and recognizes revenue in the period regulatory approval occurs (the performance obligation is satisfied) as these represent variable consideration. Amounts constrained as variable consideration are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The Company evaluates whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and not otherwise constrained. Accordingly, due to the inherent uncertainty of achieving regulatory approval, associated milestones are deemed constrained for revenue recognition until achievement.
Royalties:
 Under the sales-or-usage-based royalty exception the Company recognizes revenue based on the contractual percentage of the licensee’s sale of products to its customers at the later of (i) the occurrence of the related product sales or (ii) the date upon which the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, the Company has not recognized any royalty revenue from the China Out-License.
Sales Threshold Milestones:
 Similar to royalties, applying the sales-or-usage-based royalty exception, the Company recognizes revenue from sales threshold milestones at the later of (i) the period the licensee achieves the one-time annual product sales levels in their territories for which the Company is contractually entitled to a specified lump-sum receipt, or (ii) the date upon which the performance obligation to which some or all of the milestone has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied. To date, the Company has not recognized any sales threshold milestone revenue from the China Out-License. 
The Company re-evaluates the measure of progress to each performance obligation in each reporting period as uncertain events are resolved and other changes in circumstances occur.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales consists of direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of XDEMVY, including raw materials, third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight-in, third-party royalties payable on the Company’s product sales, net and amortization of capitalized intangible assets associated with XDEMVY. Cost of sales also includes period costs related to certain inventory warehouse and distribution operations and inventory adjustment charges. The Company began capitalizing inventory costs upon FDA approval of XDEMVY in July 2023. Prior to FDA approval of XDEMVY, manufacturing and other inventory costs were recorded to research and development expenses in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. As of December 31, 2024 the Company has sold materially all inventory that was recorded to research and development expenses prior to FDA approval of XDEMVY.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative costs consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and other personnel-related costs for the Company's executive, finance, sales and marketing, and other administrative functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include sales and marketing costs to support the Company's commercial launch starting in August 2023, consulting fees, legal services, rent and other facilities costs, patient assistance donations, the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee on Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers, and other general

 million and $
9.4
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were 
no
 advertising costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred or as certain upfront or milestone payments become contractually due to licensors upon the achievement of clinical or regulatory events. Research and development expenses include internal costs directly attributable to in-development programs, including the costs of salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefit and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation expense), license fees, materials, supplies, and the cost of services provided by outside contractors to conduct nonclinical studies, clinical trials and contract manufacturing activities. All costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with third-party service providers under the service agreements. As it relates to clinical trials, the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received. Such payments are evaluated for current or long-term classification based on when they will be realized. The Company's objective is to reflect the appropriate expense in its financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which the services and efforts are expended. The Company accounts for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial taking into consideration discussions with applicable personnel and outside service providers. The clinical trial accrual is dependent in part upon the timely and accurate reporting of progress and efforts incurred from contract research organizations ("CROs"), contract manufacturers and other third-party vendors. Although estimates are expected to be materially consistent with actual amounts incurred, the Company's understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed can vary and may result in changes in estimates in any particular period. The Company makes significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities balance at each reporting period. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its accrued liabilities. To date, there have been no material differences between estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.
The Company has entered into, and may continue to enter into, license agreements to access and utilize certain technology. In each case, the Company evaluates if the license agreement results in the acquisition of an asset or a business. To date, none of the Company's license agreements have been considered an acquisition of a business. For asset acquisitions, the upfront payments to acquire such licenses, as well as any future milestone payments made before product approval that do not meet the definition of a derivative, are immediately recognized as research and development expense in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss when paid or become payable, provided there is no alternative future use of rights in other research and development projects.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for equity awards granted to employees, consultants, and members of its Board of Directors. Stock option awards are at an exercise price of not less than 
100
% of the fair market value of common stock on the respective date of grant. The grant date is the date the terms of the award are formally approved by the Company’s Board of Directors or its designee. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards as of the date of grant. The fair value of restricted stock units is representative of the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date preceding the award grant-date.
Stock awards granted typically have 
one
 to 
four-year
 service conditions and a contractual term of 
10
 years. Any performance conditions for vesting are explicitly stated in each award agreement and are associated with clinical, business development, or operational milestones. For stock-based awards that vest subject to the satisfaction of a service requirement, the related expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over each award’s actual or implied vesting period. For stock-based awards that vest subject to a performance condition, the Company recognizes related expense on an accelerated attribution method, if and when it concludes that it is highly probable that the performance condition will be achieved. At each reporting period, the Company reassesses the probability of the achievement of the performance vesting conditions. As applicable, the Company reverses previously recognized expense for unvested awards in the same period of forfeiture.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(all tabular amounts presented in thousands, except share, per share, per unit, and number of years)
The measurement of the fair value of stock option awards and recognition of stock-based compensation expense requires assumptions to be estimated by management that involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment, including (i) the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the option grant for all awards granted prior to the IPO, (ii) the expected term of the stock option until its exercise by the recipient, (iii) stock price volatility over the expected term, (iv) the prevailing risk-free interest rate over the expected term, and (v) expected dividend payments over the expected term.
All stock-based compensation expense is reported in the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss within cost of sales, research and development expense or selling, general and administrative expense, based upon the assigned department of the award recipient. The measurement of the fair value of stock option awards and recognition of stock-based compensation expense requires assumptions to be estimated by management that involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment, including:
Fair Value of Common Stock
 — The fair value of the Company’s common stock is based on the closing quoted market price of its common stock as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of the option grant. 
Expected Term
 — The Company’s expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock option awards are expected to be outstanding. Management estimates the expected term of awarded stock options utilizing the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term) to determine the expected term since the Company does not yet have sufficient exercise history. 
Expected Volatility
 — Prior to 2023, the Company did not have sufficient trading history for its common stock to use its own historical volatility. Management estimated the expected volatility based on a designated peer-group of publicly-traded companies for a look-back period (from the date of grant) that corresponded with the expected term of the awarded stock option. Beginning in January 2023, the Company began using its own historical stock price for expected volatility.
Risk-Free Interest Rate
 — The Company estimates the risk-free interest rate based upon the U.S. Department of Treasury yield curve in effect at award grant date for the time period that corresponds with the expected term of the awarded stock option.
Dividend Yield
 — The Company’s expected dividend yield is 
zero
 because it has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to for the foreseeable future.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the financial statements, as well as operating losses and tax credit carry forwards using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of enactment. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain due to the Company’s historical operating performance and recorded cumulative net losses in prior fiscal periods. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets, because based upon a weighting of positive and negative factors, it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. If or when the Company were to determine that deferred tax assets are realizable, an adjustment to the corresponding valuation allowance would increase the net income in the period that such determination was made.
The Company’s income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of the Company’s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While the Company believes it has appropriate support for the positions

taken on its tax returns, the Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. The Company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of potential revisions and adjusts the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are recorded as a component of income tax expense.
Net Loss per Share 
Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, without consideration for potential dilutive shares of common stock. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method and if-converted method as applicable. 
 Due to net losses in all periods presented, all otherwise potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive, and accordingly, the reported basic net loss per share equals diluted net loss per share.
Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss represents (i) net loss for the periods presented, and (ii) unrealized gains or losses on the Company's reported marketable securities and cash equivalents.

Recently Issued or Effective Accounting Standards
Recently issued or effective accounting pronouncements that impact, or may have an impact, on the Company’s financial statements have been discussed within the footnote to which each relates. Outside of the pronouncements below, other recent accounting pronouncements not disclosed in these Financial Statements have been determined by the Company’s management to have no impact, or an immaterial impact, on its current financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. This requires publicly traded entities to provide enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses regularly reviewed by the CODM, including publicly traded entities with a single reportable segment. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted this standard during the year ended December 31, 2024. Refer to the Segment Reporting Footnote (
Note 8
) for related disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosure
 ("ASU 2023-09"). ASU 2023-09 requires annual disclosures of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold and a disaggregation of income taxes paid, net of refunds. The standard also eliminates certain existing disclosure requirements related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities and is effective for the Company beginning with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending 2025. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2023-09 should be applied prospectively. Retrospective adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact this standard will have on its financial statements.

Money Market Funds and U.S. Treasury Securities
Money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities are highly liquid investments and are actively traded with readily-available market prices that are publicly observable and independently validated as of the measurement date. This approach results in the classification of these securities as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
Commercial Paper, Corporate Debt Securities, and Government-related Debt Securities
Commercial paper, corporate debt securities and government-related debt securities were valued using Level 2 inputs that utilized industry standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate fair value. The Company reviews trading activity and pricing for these investments as of each measurement date.
LianBio Common Stock and Equity Warrants
In March 2021, contemporaneous with the China Out-License transaction, the Company and LianBio executed a warrant agreement for the Company to purchase, in 
three
 tranches, common shares in LianBio at an exercise price equal to common stock par value, which converted into warrants of the parent company of LianBio (a pharmaceutical company focused on the Greater China and other Asian markets; Nasdaq: LIAN; any references to common stock or warrants of LianBio shall refer to common stock or warrants of the publicly-traded parent of LianBio) in connection with LianBio's previous initial public offering. The first 
two
 tranches were vested, exercised, and converted into 
156,746
 shares of LianBio common stock as of December 31, 2022 and were recognized at fair value within long-term investments on the Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, LianBio common stock was classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, given its publicly reported price.
In February 2024, LianBio announced its plan to wind down its operations. In March 2024, LianBio's Board of Directors made a special cash dividend payment to the Company for $
0.7
 million (equivalent to $
4.80
 per share), which was recorded to other income (expense) in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2024. LianBio was delisted from Nasdaq in March 2024 and trades on the over-the-counter markets. In June 2024, the Company sold its LianBio common stock and recognized a realized loss within other income (expense) in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss during the year ended December 31, 2024, which was not material.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
2020 and 2016 Equity Incentive Plans
The Company's Board of Directors and stockholders adopted and approved the Company's 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”) in October 2020. The 2020 Plan replaced the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan that was earlier adopted in December 2016 (the "2016 Plan", collectively "the 2020 and 2016 Plans"). However, awards outstanding under the 2016 Plan will continue to be governed by its original terms. The number of shares of the Company's common stock that were initially available for issuance under the 2020 Plan equaled the initial sum of 
9,000,000
 shares plus 
2,432,980
 shares that were then available for issuance under the 2016 Plan. The 2020 Plan provides for the following types of awards: incentive and non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, and restricted stock units.
The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan are increased automatically on the first business day of each fiscal year, commencing in 2021 and ending in 2030, by a number equal to the lesser of: (i) 
4
% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the last business day of the prior fiscal year; or (ii) the number of shares determined by the Company's Board of Directors. In general, to the extent that any awards under the 2020 Plan are forfeited, terminate, expire or lapse without the issuance of shares, or if the Company reacquires the shares subject to awards granted under the 2020 Plan, those shares will again become available for issuance under the 2020 Plan, as will shares applied to pay the exercise or purchase price of an award or to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to any award.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under the terms of the Company's 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), eligible employees can purchase common stock through scheduled payroll deductions. The purchase price is equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the first or last day of the offering period (whichever is less), minus a 
15
% discount. To determine the value of ESPP expense to be recognized during each offering period, the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used, in combination with the discounted employee price. A participant may purchase a maximum of 
3,000
 shares of common stock during a 
six-month
 offering period, not to exceed $
25,000
 at full market value on the offering date during each ESPP year.
Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP are increased automatically on the first business day of each fiscal year, commencing in 2021 and ending in 2040, by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 
one
 percent of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last day of the year, (ii) 
2.5
 million shares, or (iii) a number determined by the Board of Directors.
Common Stock Outstanding and Reserves for Future Issuance
As of December 31, 2024 the Company had 
38.3
 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding, which excludes 
312,500
 of pre-funded warrants that remained exercisable at period end and are reserved for future issuance. As of December 31, 2023 the Company had 
34.2
 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Common stockholders have 
one
 vote for each share of common stock held and are entitled to receive dividends declared by the Company’s Board of Directors when legally available for distribution, then-subject to the dividend rights of the holders of preferred stock. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, 
no
 dividends were declared.

SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company manages business activities on an aggregated basis and operates in 
one
 reportable segment: therapeutics. The therapeutics segment derives revenue primarily through sales of XDEMVY to specialty pharmacies and distributors in the U.S, who in turn sell it directly to clinics, hospitals, pharmacies and federal healthcare programs. The segment also generates license fees and collaboration revenue related to the China Out-License arrangement (see 
Note 10
). The accounting policies of the therapeutics segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see 
Note 2
).
The Company’s chief operating decision-maker ("CODM") is its Chief Executive Officer. The CODM uses net loss, as reported in the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, to assess performance of the therapeutics segment and in deciding whether to allocate resources into the therapeutics segment or outside the segment, such as for acquisitions or new in-license agreements. The CODM uses net loss to regularly monitor budget versus actual results which are used in assessing performance of the segment and in establishing management’s compensation. The CODM does not review assets in evaluating the results of the therapeutics segment, and therefore, such information is not presented.

COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES
Lease Agreements
Current Lease Agreement
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into lease agreements with unaffiliated third parties for its facilities and office equipment. As of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company had 
six
, 
five
, and 
four
 active leases, respectively, for adjacent office and laboratory suites in Irvine, California.
In March 2024, the Company executed an amendment for an additional office suite. This amendment was accounted for as a lease modification and resulted in the recognition of an operating lease ROU asset valued at $
0.4
 million as of the execution date. 
In December 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to terminate its existing facility lease agreements (the "Current Lease") and entered into a new lease agreement (the "New Lease"), both with the same landlord, to relocate its corporate headquarters. The Current Lease will terminate upon the earlier of the substantial completion of tenant improvements at the New Lease premises or the commencement of the Company's regular business activities at the New Lease premises, which the Company expects to begin occupying in late 2025, as discussed in more detail below.

New Lease Agreement
In December 2024, the Company entered into the New Lease agreement for 
59,626
 square feet of office space located in Irvine, California for a 
10-year
 lease term. The lease payments are expected to commence in late 2025 following the earlier of: (i) eleven months following the lease execution date, or (ii) the date the Company commences its regular business activities at the premises following completion of tenant improvements. The base rent for the first year of the lease will be $
2.5
 million and is subject to annual increases of 
3
% thereafter. The Company is entitled to an abatement of base rent for the first five full calendar months from the beginning of the lease commencement date for an aggregate amount of $
0.7
 million. The lease also provides for a tenant improvement allowance, not to exceed $
6.0
 million, to be applied to the construction costs of the premises. The tenant improvement allowance must be used within one year of the Company commencing its regular business activities otherwise it will be forfeited with no further obligation by the landlord. As of December 31, 2024, no rent payments were made and the landlord had not provided any of the tenant improvement allowance. 
Upon lease execution, the Company provided the landlord a letter of credit for $
2.6
 million to serve as a security deposit. Provided that no defaults occur, and the Company meets certain financial milestones for certain time periods, the security deposit can be subsequently be reduced.
In-License Agreements
Elanco In-License Agreement for Skin and Eye Disease or Conditions in Humans
In January 2019, the Company executed a license agreement with Elanco Tiergesundheit AG (“Elanco”) for exclusive worldwide rights to certain intellectual property for the development and commercialization of lotilaner in the treatment or cure of any eye or skin disease or condition in humans, as amended in June 2022 (the "Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement"). The Company has sole financial responsibility for related development, regulatory, and commercialization activities.
In March 2023, a clinical milestone was triggered to Elanco under the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement upon enrollment of the first patient in the Phase 2a Galatea trial, evaluating the potential treatment of rosacea. The related milestone payment of $
1.0
 million was included in research and development expense in the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2023.
The Company made cash payments to Elanco under the Eye and Derm Agreement comprised of $
1.0
 million upfront upon contract execution in January 2019 and a total of $
4.0
 million for three specified clinical milestone achievements in September 2020, April 2021, and March 2023, which were all recorded in research and development expense in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. During 2023, a milestone of $
4.0
 million was achieved and paid to Elanco upon the first commercial sale of XDEMVY in the U.S., which was recorded to intangible assets, net in the accompanying Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. In September 2024, a $
5.0

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(all tabular amounts presented in thousands, except share, per share, per unit, and number of years)
The Company is obligated to make further cash payments to Elanco of $
2.0
 million under the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement upon achievement of the last clinical milestone in the treatment of human skin diseases using lotilaner and a maximum of $
70.0
 million for various commercial and sales threshold milestones for the treatment of human skin diseases and the treatment of blepharitis in humans using lotilaner. 
In addition, the Company is obligated to pay tiered contractual royalties to Elanco in the mid to high single digits of its net sales. If the Company receives certain types of payments from its sublicensees, it will be obligated to pay Elanco a variable percentage in the low to mid double-digits of such proceeds, until achievement of the first applicable regulatory approval of a product covered under the license, which occurred in July 2023 with the FDA approval of XDEMVY. As a result of the commercialization of XDEMVY, the Company began accruing royalties payable to Elanco during the third quarter of 2023, which are recorded to cost of sales in the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities in the accompanying Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Royalty expense during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
9.0
 million, and $
0.7
 million, respectively. There was 
no
 royalty expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022.
Elanco In-License Agreement for All Other Diseases or Conditions in Humans
In September 2020, the Company executed a license agreement with Elanco granting it a worldwide license to certain intellectual property for the development and commercialization of lotilaner for the treatment, palliation, prevention, or cure of all other diseases and conditions in humans (i.e., beyond that of the eye or skin), as amended in June 2022 (the "All Human Uses Elanco Agreement"). 
The Company made cash payments under the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement of $
0.5
 million related to a clinical milestone that was triggered in December 2022 upon enrollment of the first patient in the Phase 2a Carpo trial, for the potential treatment of Lyme disease.

Other In-License Agreement for All Ophthalmic Uses in Humans
In October 2024, the Company executed a new in-license agreement for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize a compound for all ophthalmic uses. The Company made an upfront payment of $
2.5
 million upon contract execution in October 2024, which was recorded to research and development expense in the accompanying Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Indemnities and Guarantees
The Company has certain indemnity commitments, under which it may be required to make payments to its officers and directors in relation to certain transactions to the maximum extent permitted under applicable laws.

The Company has not been obligated to make any such payments to date and no liabilities have been recorded for this contingency in the accompanying Balance Sheets.
10. 
OUT-LICENSE AGREEMENT
Out-License of TP-03 Commercial Rights in the China Territory in March 2021
In March 2021, the Company entered into the China Out-License agreement with LianBio for its exclusive development and commercialization rights of TP-03 (lotilaner ophthalmic solution) 0.25% in the China Territory for the treatment of 
Demodex
 blepharitis and Meibomian Gland Disease. LianBio is contractually responsible for all clinical development and commercialization activities and costs within the China Territory.
The Company assessed this arrangement and identified the following material promises under the arrangement: (i) the exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, make, offer for sale, sell, and import TP-03 in the China Territory; and (ii) the research and development services in the form of clinical study materials for the respective Phase 2b/3 trial (Saturn-1) and Phase 3 (Saturn-2) TP-03 trials. The promises to provide research and development services for Saturn-1 and Saturn-2 clinical trials were evaluated and determined to be distinct promises in the contract and each of the two clinical trials are separate performance obligations apart from the promise to provide the license.
The assessment of the initial transaction price for the China Out-License included an analysis of amounts the Company expected to receive, which at contract inception consisted of: (i) the upfront cash payment of $
15.0
 million; (ii) a second cash payment of $
10.0
 million; (iii) a $
10.0
 million milestone that was determined to be within the control of the Company; and (iv) $
1.2
 million representing the initial fair value of the equity warrant.
The Company accounted for each performance obligation as follows: 
Out-License
The Company determined that this license was distinct based on an evaluation of the delivery of the functional license that was in the later stages of development, and it met the criteria for being distinct from the research and development services required under the China Out-License. The Company determined the standalone selling price of this license using a discounted projected sales model and recognized as license fees and collaboration revenue the total allocated transaction price at contract inception, upon delivery of the license.
Research and Development Services
The standalone selling price of these performance obligations was determined using the adjusted market assessment approach. The Company analyzed costs expected to be incurred for each of the clinical trials through completion to estimate the price that a customer would be willing to pay for these services in order to benefit from the clinical trials. The Company determined that LianBio simultaneously benefited from the research and development services that are satisfied over time, as they were able to request and access the clinical trial data at any point through the trial completion. Therefore, the Company recognized the amounts allocated to the respective research and development performance obligations for the Saturn-1 and Saturn-2 clinical trials within license fees and collaboration revenue as the research and development services were provided using an input method, based on the costs incurred for each clinical trial and the total costs expected to be incurred to satisfy each performance obligation. The Company believes this method most faithfully depicted its performance in transferring the promised services during the expected period of time that each clinical trial was ongoing. The Company monitored the expected completion dates for each clinical trial and updated its estimated time to completion at each reporting period, as necessary.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(all tabular amounts presented in thousands, except share, per share, per unit, and number of years)
 In February 2023, a specified milestone event was triggered based upon the signing of an agreement for which the Company has no ongoing obligations, resulting in $
2.5
 million recognized as license fees and collaboration revenue in the accompanying Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
In February 2024, LianBio announced its plan to wind down its operations and in March 2024 made a special cash dividend payment to the Company of $
0.7
 million (equivalent to $
4.80
 per share - see 
Note 3
). In March 2024, the Company executed the Novation Agreement and upon execution of the Novation Agreement, the China Out-License agreement with LianBio was assigned to GrandPharma and a one-time payment of $
2.5
 million (the "Termination Payment") was made to the Company from LianBio in April 2024. This Termination Payment was recorded as license fees and collaboration revenue in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Novation Agreement amended the $
15.0
 million future development milestone payable on China regulatory approval of the China Out-License agreement with a combined condition of patent issuance related to TP-03 in China.
Simultaneous with the execution of the Novation Agreement, the Company entered into the Warrant Termination Agreement for a total cancellation payment of $
0.4
 million (the "Warrant Cancellation Payment"). This Warrant Cancellation Payment was recorded as license fees and collaboration revenue in the Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Through December 31, 2024, the Company received aggregate payments from LianBio totaling $
86.1
 million, comprised of (i) initial consideration of $
15.0
 million, (ii) $
67.5
 million for the achievement of specified milestones, (iii) $
2.5
 million upon execution of the Novation Agreement, (iv) $
0.4
 million upon execution of the Warrant Termination Agreement, and (v) $
0.7
 million related to a special cash dividend.
As of December 31, 2024 the Company is eligible to receive further consideration from GrandPharma upon the achievement of additional TP-03 events, including: (i) additional regulatory approval and/or patent issuance milestones and one-time payments of up to an aggregate of $
20.0
 million; (ii) China-based TP-03 sales threshold milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $
100.0
 million; and (iii) tiered low-to-high-teen royalties for China Territory TP-03 product sales. The variable consideration related to the remaining milestone payments was fully constrained as of December 31, 2024.
11. 
CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENTS
In February 2022, the Company executed the Credit Facility with Hercules and SVB (the "2022 Credit Facility") and concurrently made a $
20.0
 million draw. The 2022 Credit Facility was amended in January 2023 and August 2023. As amended, the 2022 Credit Facility set a maximum interest rate, updated the terms of prepayment and extended the period for the Company to drawdown the $
25.0
 million tranche associated with the submission of the New Drug Application ("NDA") for T0-03. During 2023, the Company made two separate draws totaling $
10.0
 million from this $
25.0
 million tranche associated with the NDA submission of TP-03. The Company did not incur any lender fees as part of the 2022 Credit Facility.
In April 2024, the Company executed a loan and security agreement (the "2024 Credit Facility") with Pharmakon with maturity in April 2029. The 2024 Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Company's presently existing and subsequently acquired assets. Upon execution, the Company made a $
75.0
 million draw from the initial tranche of the 2024 Credit Facility, a portion of which was utilized to repay all outstanding indebtedness on the 2022 Credit Facility, resulting in total net proceeds of $
39.6
 million. The 2024 Credit Facility provides for 
three
 potential additional term loan tranches in principal amounts up to $
25.0
 million, $
50.0
 million, and $
50.0
 million, respectively, subject to customary conditions to funding and, in the case of the last 
two
 tranches, achieving minimum net product sales milestones. The 
three
 potential additional tranches may be requested on or prior to December 31, 2024, June 30, 2025, and December 31, 2025, respectively. The Company did not draw on the first additional tranche of $
25.0
 million prior to December 31, 2024.
Under the 2024 Credit Facility, the outstanding principal draws accrue interest at a floating rate based upon the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), plus a margin of 
6.75
% per annum. The SOFR is subject to a 
3.75
% floor. Under the First Amendment of the 2022 Credit Facility, the outstanding principal draws accrued interest at a floating interest rate per annum equal to the greater of either (i) The Wall Street Journal ("WSJ") prime rate plus 
4.45
% with an aggregate cap of 
11.45
%, or (ii) 
8.45
%. At the execution date of the 2022 Credit Facility, the WSJ prime rate was 
3.25
% and increased to 
8.50
% as of the date of its extinguishment.

The Company was required to pay a specified fee upon the earlier of (i) February 2, 2027, or (ii) the date the Company prepays, in full or in part, the outstanding principal balance of the 2022 Credit Facility ("End of Term Charge"). As the 2022 Credit Facility was paid in full upon the signing of the 2024 Credit Facility, the End of Term Charge of $
1.4
 million was paid in April 2024, which was derived by multiplying 
4.75
% by the $
30.0
 million outstanding principal balance. Prior to being paid, the End of Term Charge was accreted to interest expense over the expected maturity date. The Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $
1.9
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 in the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the effective interest rate for the full term of the Credit Facilities was 
12.61
%, 
11.96
%, and 
13.61

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company maintains a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty that such assets will be realized and evaluates the recoverability of its deferred tax assets on at least an annual basis. The Company has determined that its deferred tax assets, with the exception of amounts supported by the reversal of taxable temporary differences, are not realizable. Consequently, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $
88.0
 million and $
60.3
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
At December 31, 2024, the Company has federal and state NOL carryforwards of approximat
ely $
138.5
 million a
nd $
111.5
 million, respectively. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"), for U.S. income tax purposes, NOLs generated prior to December 31, 2017 can be carried forward for up to 20 years, while NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but are limited to 80% utilization against taxable income. The Company’s total federal NOL of $
138.5
 million

will not expire but will only be able to offset 80% of future taxable income within each year. The other state NOLs will begin to expire in 2029. At December 31, 2024, the Company had federal and other state research and development tax credits of $
8.4
 million and $
3.0
 million, respectively. The federal research and development tax credits begin to expire in 2040 unless previously utilized, and of the other state credit carryforwards $
0.2
 million begin to expire in 2037 while the remaining $
2.8
 million do not expire.
The Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Sections 382 and 383 limit annual use of NOL and research and development credit carryforwards in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% occurs within a three-year period. The Company has completed an ownership change analysis, which resulted in some ownership changes.  Of the total federal and state NOLs of $
138.5
 million and $
111.5
 million respectively, $
80.1
 million and $
53.7
 million are available as of December 31, 2024 and $
136.9
 million and $
110.5
 million are available as of December 31, 2025 to offset future taxable income. The remaining $
1.6
 million and $
1.0
 million will become available in future years. If a requisite ownership change occurs in the future, the amount of remaining tax attribute carryforwards available to offset taxable income and income tax expense in future years may be restricted or eliminated. If eliminated, the related asset would be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, limitations created by future ownership changes, if any, will not impact the Company’s effective tax rate.
Uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period. Subsequent changes in judgement based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, derecognition, and

measurement. Adjustment may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more-likely-than-not that it will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $
4.8
 million, 
none
 of which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months. The Company's policy is to recognize the interest expense and/or penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense. The Company had no accrual for interest or penalties in the accompanying Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024 and has not recognized interest and/or penalties in the accompanying Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, or 2023.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Conclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, among other processes, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective 
to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). We maintain internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2024, covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
On June 28, 2024, the last business day of the second quarter in 2024, the aggregate market value of the shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million. As such, during the year ended December 31, 2024, we formally implemented certain internal controls over all business and information technology processes in order to comply with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Additionally, we will no longer (i) qualify as an emerging growth company, (ii) qualify as a smaller reporting company, and (iii) be exempt from providing an auditor's attestation report on internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control 
151
system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of t
wo or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Tarsus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
