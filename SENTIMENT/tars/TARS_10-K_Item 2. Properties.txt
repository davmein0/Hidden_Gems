Item 2. Properties.
We currently lease approximately 39,181 square feet of office and laboratory space in Irvine, California. In December 2024, we entered into a new lease agreement for 59,626 square feet of office space located in Irvine, California for a 10-year lease term. The lease payments are expected to commence in late 2025 following the earlier of: (i) eleven months following the lease execution date, or (ii) the date the Company commences its regular business activities at the premises following completion of tenant improvements. We believe that this space will be sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future and that any additional space we may require will be available on commercially reasonable terms (see 
Note 9
).
