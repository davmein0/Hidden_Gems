1A.  Risk Factors.
​
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
​
Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risk factors. Consequently, the following is not a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
​
If semiconductor chip manufacturers do not make sufficient capital expenditures, our sales and profitability will be harmed.
​
New systems orders and used tool sales depend upon demand from semiconductor chip manufacturers who build or expand fabrication facilities. When the rate of construction or expansion of fabrication facilities declines, demand for our systems will decline, reducing our revenue. In addition, all or a portion of the demand for increased capacity may be satisfied by a semiconductor chip manufacturer’s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment they already own.  Revenue decline also hurts our profitability because our established cost structure and our continued investments in engineering, research and development, and marketing necessary to develop new products and to maintain extensive customer service and support capabilities, limit our ability to reduce expenses in proportion to declining sales. 
​
If we fail to develop and introduce reliable new or enhanced products and services that meet the needs of semiconductor chip manufacturers, our results will suffer.
​
Rapid technological changes in semiconductor chip manufacturing processes require us to respond quickly to changing customer requirements. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully introduce new systems and product lines with improved capabilities. This will depend upon a variety of factors, including new product selection, timely and efficient completion of product design and development as well as manufacturing and assembly processes, product performance in the field and effective sales and marketing. In particular:
​
●
We must continue to develop competitive technical specifications for new systems, or enhancements to our existing systems, and manufacture and ship these systems or enhancements in volume in a timely manner.
​
●
We will need to accurately predict the schedule on which our customers will be ready to transition to new products, in order to accurately forecast demand for new products while managing the transition from older products.
​
●
We will need to effectively manage product reliability or quality problems that often exist with new systems, in order to avoid higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance and payment and additional service and warranty expenses, and ultimately, a lack of repeat orders.
​
●
Our new products must be accepted in the marketplace.
​
Our failure to meet any of these requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operating results and profitability.
​
Axcelis is subject to the risks of operating internationally: we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from outside the United States, especially from Asia.
​
We are substantially dependent on sales of our products and services to customers outside the United States. International sales, including export sales from our U.S. manufacturing facilities to non-U.S. customers and sales by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, accounted for 85.8% of total revenue in 2024. Customers based in Asia dominate our international sales. Ion implanter system shipments to customers in Asia represented 81.0% of total system revenue in 2024. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In particular, we expect 
12

Table of Contents
that sales to Chinese customers (both global and domestic Chinese chip manufacturers) will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales, creating both risk and opportunity. 
​
U.S. export controls on shipments to Chinese customers have been notably increasing since 2020.  Since the placement of SMIC on the U.S. Entity List in 2020, we are required to obtain export control licenses to ship to mature process SMIC fabs, which to date, we have been able to obtain.  Other chipmakers have been placed on the Entity List, some with, and some without, a similar policy allowing licensed shipments on specified conditions.  A new export controls regulatory framework issued by the U.S. in October 2022 and supplemented in 2023, prohibits all semiconductor equipment shipments to Chinese customers (other than certain multi-nationals) who are producing or developing logic, DRAM and NAND chips meeting specific advanced parameters.  While these regulations have further excluded exports to certain Chinese customers, we currently are able to continue to ship to the majority of our Chinese customers.  In general, however, continuing revenue from Chinese customers is at higher risk than continuing revenue form customers in other international locations because of trade tensions between the United States government and the Chinese government, and other challenges reflecting China’s stage of development and rapid growth. 
​
Increased U.S. export controls and other political and trade tensions exacerbate the risk that Chinese customers will change suppliers to non-U.S. vendors, such as Advanced Ion Beam Technology, Inc., Nissin Ion Equipment Co., 
Ltd. and Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ion Technology Co., Ltd.  In addition, two Chinese entities, known as Kingstone Semiconductor and CETC Electronics Equipment Group Co., Ltd., are developing ion implanters for the Chinese domestic market.  The loss of a significant customer or any reduction or delays in our ability to ship to any significant customer will adversely affect us.
​
We source a substantial portion of our materials from outside of the United States. Because of our dependence upon international sales and our global supply chain, our results and prospects may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
​
●
changes in laws or regulations resulting in more burdensome governmental controls, tariffs, restrictions, embargoes or export license requirements;
●
volatility in currency exchange rates;
●
political and economic instability;
●
global health emergencies, such as pandemics have the potential to disrupt our manufacturing operations and those of our supply chain, as well as cause our customers to delay or cancel shipments;
●
difficulties in accounts receivable collections;
●
extended payment terms beyond those customarily offered in the United States;
●
difficulties in managing suppliers, service providers or representatives outside of the United States;
●
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations; and
●
potential adverse tax consequences.
​
The U.S. government has proposed or enacted tariffs and substantial changes to trade policies, which could adversely affect our business. For example, the U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain foreign products, including most recently from Canada, Mexico and China, that in the past have resulted in and may result in future retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and products. We cannot predict whether these policies will continue, or if new policies will be enacted, or the impact, if any, that any policy changes could have on our business.
​
Our dependence upon suppliers for many components and sub-assemblies could result in increased costs or delays in the manufacture and sale of our products.
​
We rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to manufacture many of the components and sub-assemblies of our products. We obtain many of these components and sub-assemblies from a limited group of suppliers. Accordingly, based on situations outside of our control, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of required components on a timely basis, on price and other terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, we often quote prices to our customers and accept customer orders for our products before purchasing components and sub-assemblies from our suppliers. If our 
13

Table of Contents
suppliers increase the cost of components or sub-assemblies, we may not have alternative sources of supply and may not be able to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of components, negatively impacting our gross margin.
​
The manufacture of some of these components and sub-assemblies is an extremely complex process and requires long lead times. As a result, we could experience delays or shortages. If we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required components or sub-assemblies, we may have to seek alternative sources of supply or manufacture these components internally. This could delay our ability to manufacture or to ship our systems on a timely basis, causing us to lose sales, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions, and suffer harm to our reputation.
​
Moreover, if actual demand for Axcelis’ products is different than expected, Axcelis may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing, or expediting delivery of parts. If Axcelis purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Axcelis may incur excess inventory charges.
​
A significant portion of our revenue depends on customers electing to buy aftermarket products and services from Axcelis.
​
Historically, a significant portion of our product revenue and all of our service revenue relates to our sale of “aftermarket” products and services, which include parts, consumables, upgrades, service contracts, and time and materials billings. Some of our customers purchase fewer aftermarket products and services, often training their own staff to maintain and service semiconductor capital equipment rather than relying on the equipment manufacturer for these services. In addition, we compete against third-party parts suppliers for the sale of parts and consumables that are not protected by patents or otherwise proprietary. To the extent our customers purchase parts and services from other vendors or provide their own system maintenance labor, our revenue and profitability will be reduced.
​
If we fail to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor capital equipment industry, our sales and profitability will decline.
​
The ion implant segment is highly competitive and includes one company with substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support resources that may better position it to compete successfully than we can, as well as several smaller companies that could provide innovative systems with technology that may have performance advantages. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics. If we are unable to improve or introduce competing products when demanded by the markets, our business will be harmed. Finally, if we must lower prices to remain competitive without commensurate cost of goods savings, our gross margin and profitability will be adversely affected.
​
We are dependent on sales to a limited number of large customers; the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders from them could materially affect our sales.
​
Historically, we have sold a significant portion of our products and services to a limited number of semiconductor chip manufacturers. In 2024, our top ten customers accounted for 45.9% of our net sales, in comparison to 51.7% and 59.4% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. None of our customers have entered into a long-
term agreement requiring it to purchase our products. Our customers located in China represent a significant portion of our revenue, and are subject to U.S. export controls restrictions, as discussed above.  Although the composition of the group comprising our largest customers has varied from year to year, the loss of a significant customer or any reduction or delays in orders from any significant customer will adversely affect us. Consolidation of semiconductor chip manufacturers may result in the loss of a customer.
​
Our international operations involve currency risk.
​
Substantially all of our system sales are billed in U.S. dollars. We also pay almost all non-U.S. vendors providing materials, components, and subassemblies to our U.S. factory in U.S. dollars. Aftermarket revenues of our non-U.S. 
14

Table of Contents
subsidiaries are denominated in both local currency and U.S. dollars. The majority of operating expenses of these non-U.S. subsidiaries, are received and incurred in local currencies. The establishment of the Axcelis Asia Operations Center in South Korea has increased the volume of our transactions in non-U.S. dollar currencies and increased the impact of foreign exchange gain / loss on the Company’s financial results.  The Company experiences translation adjustments when local currency accounts payable on non-U.S. subsidiary books are re-measured for consolidated financial reporting. Similarly, the translation of long-term asset and liability values to U.S. dollars are recorded in stockholders’ equity as an element of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  The value of the asset or liability in U.S. dollars will increase or decrease relative to the local currency based on changes in the exchange rate between the two currencies over the period.  As a result, any unplanned non-cash gains or losses are recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates can impact reported revenues, expense, and profitability and asset values in our Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 6.2% of our revenue was derived in local currencies from foreign operations with this inherent risk. In addition, at December 31, 2024, our operations outside of the United States accounted for approximately 9.2% of our total assets, the majority of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 
​
We may not be able to maintain and expand our business if we are not able to hire, retain and integrate qualified personnel.
​
Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified, experienced employees. There is substantial competition for experienced engineering, technical, financial, sales and marketing personnel in our industry. In particular, we must attract and retain highly skilled design and process engineers. Competition for such personnel is intense, both in the Boston metropolitan area and in other locations around the world. If we are unable to retain our existing key personnel, or attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we may experience insufficient levels of staffing to fully develop, manufacture and market our products and perform services for our customers. As a result, our growth could be limited or we could fail to meet our delivery commitments or experience deterioration in service levels or decreased customer satisfaction, all of which could adversely affect our financial results.
​
Our financial results may fluctuate significantly.
​
We derive our new systems revenue from the sale of a small number of expensive products to a relatively small number of customers. The selling prices on our ion implant systems range from approximately $2.6 million to $12.0 million. We also sell used equipment in our aftermarket business. Each sale, or failure to make a sale, may have a significant effect on us in a particular quarter. In a given quarter, a number of factors can adversely affect our revenue and results, including changes in our product mix, increased fixed expenses per unit due to reductions in the number of products manufactured, and higher fixed costs due to increased levels of research and development and expansion of our worldwide sales and marketing organization. Our financial results also fluctuate based on gross profit realized on sales. A variety of factors may cause gross profit as a percentage of revenue to vary, including the mix and average selling prices of products sold, costs to manufacture and customize systems, warranty costs and the impact of changes to inventory reserves. New product introductions may also affect our gross margin. Fluctuations in our financial results may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.
​
Our financial results may fall short of anticipated levels because forecasting revenue and profitability is complex and may be inaccurate.
​
Management may from time to time provide financial forecasts to investors. These forecasts are based on assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable when made, of the timing of system orders, system shipments, system acceptance and aftermarket revenue. Any of these assumptions can prove erroneous and the level of revenue recognizable in a particular quarter may vary from the forecast. Our lengthy sales cycle, coupled with customers’ competing capital budget considerations, make revenue difficult to predict. In addition, our backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all orders required to achieve our sales objectives for that quarter and is not a reliable indicator of our future sales. As a result, our revenue and operating results for a quarter depend on our shipping systems on previous orders as scheduled during that quarter, receiving customer acceptance of previously shipped products, and obtaining new orders for products and services to be provided within that same quarter. Any delay in, or cancellation of, scheduled shipments and 
15

Table of Contents
customer acceptances or in revenue from new orders, including aftermarket revenue, could materially affect our financial results.
​
Accounting rules addressing revenue recognition add more complexity in forecasting quarterly revenue and profitability. Orders for our products usually contain multiple performance obligations that result in revenue deferral under generally accepted accounting principles. Due to the foregoing factors, investors should understand that our actual financial results for a quarter may vary significantly from our forecasts of financial performance for that quarter. Failure to meet forecasted financial performance may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.
​
The semiconductor equipment industry is cyclical and we expect that demand for our products will increase and decrease, making it difficult to manage the business and potentially causing harm to our sales and profitability.
​
The semiconductor industry is cyclical, experiencing upturns when the demand for our products is high and downturns when our customers are not investing in new or expanded fabrication facilities. From time to time, inventory buildups in the semiconductor device industry produce an oversupply of semiconductors. This can cause a reduced demand for capital equipment such as our products, negatively impacting our sales and level of profitability. Our revenue can vary significantly from one point in the cycle to another, making it difficult to manage the business, both when revenue is increasing and when it is decreasing. In addition, a substantial portion of our operating expenses do not fluctuate with changes in volume. Significant decreases in revenue can therefore have a disproportionate effect on profitability. In addition, reduced demand for our products and services may require Axcelis to implement cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Axcelis’ ability to capitalize on opportunities that arise in the future.
Axcelis is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.
In the conduct of our business, Axcelis collects, uses, transmits, and stores data on information

technology systems. This data includes confidential information belonging to Axcelis, our employees or our customers or other business partners, some of which is personally-identifiable information of individuals. As reported in the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report, cyber-attacks in the manufacturing industries are almost entirely financially motivated.  Axcelis has been and expects to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents, including through employee error or misuse; individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems; and sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have had a material impact on the Company to date. 
​
Axcelis implements a “Layered Security Strategy” that aligns with National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework.  To do so, we devote resources to network security, data encryption, employee training and other measures to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse.  This includes continuously monitoring and reacting to the cybersecurity environment, by implementing best-in-class solutions from several vendors.  On an on-going basis, we engage a cybersecurity consultant to validate and advise on the Company’s cyber landscape and to drive employee vigilance through employee cyber training and messaging.  We continually replace less secure legacy systems to improve internal and external cyber defenses and maintain a cyber incident response plan including reporting and recovery processes.  See Item IC “Cybersecurity” below.  In addition, as discussed in our proxy statement, the Audit Committee and the full Board of Directors receive quarterly reports on cybersecurity risks and annual reports on management initiatives to promote cybersecurity.
​
However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Axcelis’ and that of third parties); reputational damage; unnecessary expense; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Axcelis’ investment in research, development, and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. These adverse outcomes could negatively impact our revenues, expenses, profitability, and asset values.
​
Axcelis is subject to risks associated with compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations.
​
Axcelis is subject to environmental, health and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture, shipping, and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the 
16

Table of Contents
operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale, shipment or use of certain of its products; limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and a decrease in the value of its real property. Axcelis could be required to alter its manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could subject Axcelis to significant costs and liabilities that could adversely affect Axcelis’ business, financial condition, and results of operations.
​
Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by global pandemics.  
​

Global pandemics have in the past and may again in the future cause disruptions and restrictions on our operations and ability to travel, and similar disruptions and restrictions impacting our suppliers or customers could adversely affect our sales and operating results.  Axcelis’ products rely on an extensive global supply chain, and shortages of certain parts could impact our ability to meet customers’ shipment expectations, negatively affecting our revenues.  Such pandemics may drive changes in the demand for certain of our customers’ products, resulting in their delay or cancelation of purchases from us. The extent to which pandemics may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
​
Our proprietary technology may be vulnerable to efforts by competitors to challenge or design around, potentially reducing our market share.
​
We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademark and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, our competitors may be able to challenge, design around or legitimately use the proprietary technology embedded in our systems or other technology or information used in our business. If this occurs, the value of our proprietary technology will be diminished. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our patents may not be sufficient to prevent others from using technology that is similar to or the same as our technology. Patents issued to us may be challenged and might be invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under our patents may not provide adequate protection to us. Our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate features of our products or design around patents that may be issued to us. As a result of these threats to our proprietary technology, we may have to resort to costly litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights. Finally, all patents expire after a period of time (in the U.S., patents expire 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application). Our market share could be negatively impacted by the invalidation or expiration of a patent which had created a barrier for our competitors.
​
Axcelis also has agreements with third parties for licensing of patented or proprietary technology with Axcelis as the licensor or the licensee. Termination of license agreements or claims of infringement with respect to such technology could have an adverse impact on our financial performance or ability to ship products with existing configurations.
​
We (or customers that we indemnify) might face intellectual property infringement claims or patent disputes that may be costly to resolve and, if resolved against us, could be very costly to us and prevent us from making and selling our systems.
​
From time to time, claims and proceedings may be asserted against us relative to patent validity or infringement matters. We typically agree to indemnify our customers from liability to third parties for intellectual property infringement arising from the use of our products in their intended manner. Therefore, we may receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties. Our involvement in any patent dispute or other intellectual property dispute or action to protect trade secrets, even if the claims are without merit, could be very expensive and could divert the attention of our management. Adverse determinations in any litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to remove certain features from our products or seek costly licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing and selling our systems. In addition, infringement indemnification clauses in system sale agreements may require us to take other actions 
17

Table of Contents
or require us to provide certain remedies to customers who are exposed to indemnified liabilities. Any of these situations could have a material adverse effect on our business results.
​
If operations were to be disrupted at Axcelis’ manufacturing facilities, it would have a negative impact on our business.
​
Our primary manufacturing facility is located in Massachusetts, with a smaller facility located in South Korea. Our operations could be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to severe weather events, other effects of climate change, natural disasters, work stoppages, operational facility constraints and terrorism. Such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers and could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers, which could seriously harm our business.
​
If we do not have access to capital on favorable terms, on the timeline we anticipate, or at all, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
​
We require a substantial amount of capital to meet our operating requirements and remain competitive. We routinely incur significant costs to purchase inventory to meet expected system sales, to develop and introduce new products, and to place evaluation systems at new customer sites. There can be no assurance that we will realize a return on the capital expended. Although our current cash levels and borrowing capacity are expected to be adequate for our foreseeable cash requirements, if our operating results falter, or our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, we may incur debt to fund these requirements. Significant volatility or disruption in the global financial markets may result in us not being able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, on the timeline we anticipate, or at all, and we may not be able to refinance, if necessary, any outstanding debt when due, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any inability to obtain financing on favorable terms, on the timeline we anticipate, or at all, may cause us to curtail our operations significantly, reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development, or obtain funds through arrangements that management does not currently anticipate, including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies, the occurrence of any of which may significantly impair our ability to remain competitive, and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
​
The market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors. 
​
The stock markets in general, and the markets for semiconductor equipment stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. The market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, among others, some of which are beyond our control: 
​
●
variations in our quarterly results;
●
the issuance or repurchase of shares of our common stock;
●
changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our financial performance;
●
changes in market valuations of similar companies;
●
announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new products or product enhancements;
●
loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions;
●
additions or departures of key personnel; and
●
new positions adopted by investor stewardship groups and proxy advisory firms regarding desired environmental, social and governance disclosures, policies, ranking systems, and other initiatives.
​
The trading price of our common stock in the past has been significantly volatile, and we cannot accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price. 
​
We operate in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws. 
​
We are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been 
18

Table of Contents
earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. In the United States, for example, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) imposes a 15% book minimum tax on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion. To date, the IRA has not materially impacted our effective tax rate.
​
Corporate tax reform, anti-base-erosion rules and tax transparency continue to be high legislative or regulatory priorities in many jurisdictions. Changes in laws and regulations regarding these matters could impact the jurisdictions where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn adversely affect our tax liability and results of operations. As of December 31, 2024, 54 countries have enacted various aspects of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 2.0 Pillar Two global minimum tax (GMT).  In 35 of those countries, the GMT is effective beginning in 2024.  Based on currently enacted law and countries we operate in, the impact of GMT on our 2024 results did not have an impact on our business.

Axcelis implements an enterprise risk management (“ERM”) process in which management annually identifies and reviews the principal risks to which the Company’s business is subject, rating each risk in terms of likelihood of occurrence and severity of impact. Risks that have either a high likelihood or a high potential impact on our business are assessed quarterly with respect to the trend (an increasing or decreasing risk) and whether additional mitigation actions are needed.  
These quarterly risk assessments are shared with our Board of Directors, with the 
Audit Committee
 reviewing any changes in risk identification or ranking on an annual basis.
​
Cybersecurity risks are integrated
 into our overall ERM, and 
our 
Chief Information Officer
 assesses the trends and need for additional mitigations on a quarterly basis
. Our main concerns are (i) the unauthorized exfiltration of personal information pertaining to Axcelis employees, (ii) the unauthorized exfiltration of confidential business or technical information, and (iii) an inability to use our business systems for a period of time following a cybersecurity event.

​
Management has adopted a Cybersecurity Incident Response plan which lays out the roles of IT personnel, senior leadership, and legal resources in responding to a cybersecurity incident.  This plan is shared with our Board of Directors and reviewed annually.  These risks could materially impact the business of the Company.  
To date, the Company has not experienced a material cybersecurity incident
.
​
To implement risk management and protective strategies, management implements a “Layered Security Strategy” that aligns with National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework.  We consider the various factors that can play a role in the occurrence of a cybersecurity incident, such as:
​
●
Unauthorized system access
●
User errors
●
Undetected system vulnerabilities
●
Mobile device risks
●
Vulnerabilities in software applications and specific hardware
●
Third party cybersecurity risks
●
Insider threats
Management has implemented specific mitigation strategies for each of these factors, such as (i) user training to avoid fraud and other scams, (ii) utilizing multi-factor authentication processes for system access, (iii) engaging in vulnerability scanning applications, (iv) upgrading software and hardware to those with the greatest security protections, and (v) ensuring third parties to whom sensitive information is provided have appropriate security.  Management has also developed a vendor assessment form to evaluate potential “Software as a Service” providers, which is incorporated in the Company’s RFP processes. 
The Company routinely obtains and reviews SOC 2 reports from third parties who have access to the Company’s information, some of which are part of management’s internal controls over financial reporting.
