Industry Overview
​
Semiconductor chips, also known as integrated circuits, are used in a continuously evolving range of consumer and industrial products, including for example, personal computers, mobile devices, automobiles, sensors and controllers for the “internet of things” and data storage servers. Types of semiconductor chips include dynamic random-access memory 
2

Table of Contents
(“DRAM”) and “Not AND” (“NAND”) Flash memory; logic devices to process information; and “system on chip” devices (which have both logic and memory features). The demand for chips continues to increase, as a result of the electrification of vehicles, the evolution of digital communications (including the introduction of 5G mobile networks), artificial intelligence, large language models e.g. (ChatGPT), data analytics and visualization, and the growth in the Internet of Things, and the increasing complexity of device features. These chips are used in power management, data input, such as image sensors, which are often manufactured using mature processing technologies, as well as for memory to support the storage of data, internet streaming and “cloud computing” data analytics.
​
Most semiconductor chips are built on silicon or silicon carbide (“SiC”) wafers of 150mm (6 inches), 200mm (8 inches) or 300mm (12 inches) in diameter. Each semiconductor chip is made up of millions of tiny transistors or “switches” to control the functions of the device. Transistors are created in the wafer by introducing various precisely placed dopants into the silicon or SiC in specific patterns. 
​
Semiconductor chip manufacturers own or manage wafer fabrication facilities (often referred to as “fabs”), which utilize many different types of equipment in the making of integrated circuits. Over 300 process steps utilizing over 50 different types of process tools are required to make a single device like a microprocessor. Semiconductor chip manufacturers seek device performance benefits through new products and technology enhancements and productivity improvements through increased throughput, equipment utilization and higher manufacturing yields. Capacity is added by increasing the amount of manufacturing equipment in existing fabrication facilities and by constructing new fabrication facilities. 
​
We have different types of customers, which impacts the timing of purchases and technology requirements. Some customers are integrated electronics manufacturers, making semiconductor chips for their own devices.  These same companies may also act as foundries, manufacturing semiconductor chips for other electronic manufacturers or chip design companies.  Some customers only function as foundries.  A few companies design and manufacture branded chips that are sold to device manufacturers.  In addition, some customers have partnerships or joint ventures with two or more semiconductor chip manufacturers to share the technology development and capital investment.  The timing of purchases by foundry customers will depend on their success in securing manufacturing contracts.  Also, foundry customers will look for equipment that can deliver the broadest capabilities to be prepared to manufacture all chip types, while integrated electronics manufacturers may invest in processing equipment dedicated to a specific application they require for their products.
​
The semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been cyclical as global chip production capacities successively exceed, then lag behind, global chip demand. When chip demand is high, and inventories are low, chip manufacturers add capacity through capital equipment purchases. Given the difficulties of forecasting and calibrating chip demand and production capacity, the industry periodically experiences excess chip inventories and softening chip prices. Device manufacturers react with muted capital spending, lowering the demand for capital equipment. Changes in consumer and business demand for products in which chips are used also affect the industry. A successful semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer must not only provide some of the most technically complex products manufactured in the world but also must manage its business to thrive during downturns in the cycle.
​

​
Ion Implantation Systems
​
Ion implantation is a principal step in the transistor formation cycle of the semiconductor chip manufacturing process. Ion implantation is also used to change the material characteristics of the silicon or silicon carbide for reasons other than electrical doping, a process known as “material modification.” An ion implanter is a large, technically advanced system that injects dopants such as arsenic, boron or phosphorus into a wafer. These dopants are ionized and therefore have an electrical charge state. This electric charge state allows the dopants to be accelerated, focused and filtered with electric and magnetic fields. Ion implanters use these fields to create a beam of ions with a precisely defined energy level (ranging between several hundred and eight million electron-volts) and with a precisely defined beam current level (ranging from microamps to milliamps). Certain areas of the silicon wafer are blocked off by a polymer material known as photoresist, which acts as a “stencil” to pattern devices so that the dopants will only enter the wafer where needed. Typical process flows require twenty implant steps, with the most advanced processes requiring substantially more steps. Each implant step is characterized by four key parameters: dopant type, dose (amount of dopant), energy (depth into the silicon) and tilt/twist (angle of wafer relative to the ion beam).
​
To efficiently cover the wide range of implant steps, three different broad categories of implanters have been developed, each targeted at a specific range of applications, primarily defined by dose and energy. The three traditional implanter categories are referred to as high current, high energy and medium current:
​
●
High current implanters were the second type of implanter to emerge, having low energy capability and high dose range.
​
●
High energy implanters emerged to address the need for deeper implants with a high energy range and low dose.
​
●
Medium current implanters are the original model of ion implanter, with mid to low-range energy and dose capability.
​
Axcelis Ion Implanters
​
Axcelis offers a complete line of high energy, high current, and medium current implanters for all application requirements. Our Purion flagship systems are all based on a common platform which enables a unique combination of implant purity, precision, and productivity.

architectures (that ensures all points across the wafer see the same beam condition at the same beam angle), Purion products enable exceptional process control to optimize device performance and yield, at high productivity.
​
In addition to the Purion family of ion implanters, the Company offers the Ovation™ family of multi-wafer, or “batch” implanters. These systems extend Axcelis’ industry benchmark GSD platform into the future, delivering the highest reliability, serviceability, and lowest cost of operations. The Ovation configuration is designed to seamlessly integrate with the existing fleet of Axcelis batch implanters, while providing incremental performance improvements with updated components for long-term sustainability.
​
Beyond the traditional categories of implanters, Axcelis has developed systems designed for specific applications. For example, the Axcelis 
Purion Power Series
, which provides full recipe coverage for power device applications critical to electric vehicles and industrial applications. The Purion Power Series is comprised of a group of high current, medium current and high energy implanters that optimize semiconductor devices created on SiC wafers, which is advantageous for certain power devices.  
​
An overview of specific Axcelis ion implantation products is below:
​

​
Sales and Marketing
​
We primarily sell our equipment and services through our direct sales force. We conduct sales and marketing activities from our sales offices located in the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, China, Singapore, Japan, Germany and Italy. 
​
International revenue, including export sales from our U.S. manufacturing facilities to foreign customers and sales by foreign subsidiaries and branches, accounted for 85.8%, 84.1% and 84.4% of total revenue in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2024, approximately 93.8% of our sales were denominated in U.S. dollars. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a breakdown of our revenue and long-lived assets in the United States, Europe and Asia. See also Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for information about risks attendant to our foreign operations.
​
Customers
​
In 2024, according to Gartner Inc., the top 20 semiconductor chip manufacturers accounted for approximately 87.6% of total semiconductor capital equipment spending, which decreased from 92.0% in 2023. These manufacturers are from the largest semiconductor chip manufacturing regions in the world: the United States, Asia Pacific (Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Japan and China) and Europe. 
​
Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers is included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2024, no customer represented 10% or more of our consolidated revenues.  
​
U.S. export controls impact our ability to sell to certain customers in China, a country that has represented a significant portion of our sales in recent years.  One of our major Chinese customers, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (“SMIC”), is on the U.S. Entity List, but is subject to a 2020 licensing policy that allows shipments to certain mature process SMIC fabs, which to date, we have been able to obtain.  Other Chinese chipmakers are on the U.S. Entity List, without a similar policy allowing licensed shipments.  In October 2022 (with modifications in 2023), the U.S. Commerce Department established an export controls regulatory framework for U.S. exports of semiconductor equipment to China.  This framework limits all semiconductor equipment shipments to Chinese customers who are producing or developing logic, DRAM and NAND chips that meet specific advanced parameters.  The U.S. Commerce Department implemented further regulatory changes in December 2024, creating a new Export Controls Classification Number for certain 300mm ion implanters and adding certain Chinese customers to the U.S. Entity List, some of which have a licensing policy that should allow us to continue to support them.  While these regulations have further excluded exports to certain Chinese customers, we currently are able to continue to ship to substantially all of our Chinese customers.  In general, however, sales to Chinese customers represent a higher risk than sales to customers in other international locations because of trade tensions between the U.S. government and the Chinese government, and other challenges reflecting China’s stage of development and rapid growth. For example, the U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain foreign products, including most recently from Canada, Mexico and China, that in the past have resulted in and may result in future retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and products. We cannot predict whether these policies will continue, or if new policies will be enacted, or the impact, if any, that any policy changes could have on our business.
​
Research and Development
​
Our industry continues to experience rapid technological change, requiring us to frequently introduce new products and enhancements. Our Beverly, Massachusetts Advanced Technology Center houses a process development

Table of Contents
laboratory with a 13,500 square feet class 10/100/1000 clean room for product demonstrations and process development and a 17,500 square feet customer training center. The Advanced Technology Center provides infrastructure and process capabilities that allow customers to test their unique process steps on our systems under conditions that substantially replicate the customers’ production environments. This facility also provides significant capability for our research and development efforts.
​
We devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers to remain responsive to their product needs. We have also sought to reduce the development cycle for new products through a collaborative process whereby our engineering, manufacturing and marketing personnel work closely together with one another and with our customers at an earlier stage in the process. We use 3D, computer-aided design, finite element analysis and other computer-based modeling methods to test new designs and accelerate the technology innovation process.
​
Our expenses for research and development were $105.5 million, $96.9 million and $78.4 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, or 10.4%, 8.6% and 8.5% of revenue, respectively. 
​
Manufacturing
​
We manufacture products at our 417,000 square feet ISO 9001:2015, ISO 4001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 certified plant in Beverly, Massachusetts as well as our 38,000 square feet ISO 4001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 certified Axcelis Asia Operations Center in South Korea and our 101,800 square feet state-of-the-art logistics and flex manufacturing Axcelis Logistics Center in Beverly, Massachusetts. Our facilities employ best in class manufacturing techniques, including lean manufacturing, six sigma controls and advanced inventory management, purchasing and quality systems.
​
Our clean manufacturing process uses class 1,000/10,000 space to facilitate most of our manufacturing requirements.
​
Our core competency in manufacturing and supply chain management is built around system assembly and testing, which remains an in-house capability due to the high degree of expertise and intellectual property associated with the process and design. Non-core work is sourced to global partners and includes items such as vacuum systems, wafer handling and commodity-level components. We continuously pursue outsourcing opportunities where the economics are justified, with a goal of enabling quality and margin improvement. Our supply chain team is globally focused and is located in Beverly, South Korea and Singapore. Customized and commercially available software solutions drive our planning, purchasing and inventory tracking process.
​
The companies supplying Axcelis play a critical part in our success.  We want to ensure these companies share our values and have adopted a Supplier Code of Conduct, which contains our expectation that our suppliers will comply with our Environmental Policy, our Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, and other industry standards and policies.  Our Supplier Code of Conduct provides that if a supplier fails to comply with these policies, our business relationship with that company will be permanently severed, although a compliance remediation period of up to 90 days may be allowed.  
​
Our products are designed to be assembled and tested in a modular fashion, which facilitates our industry-recognized “ship-from-cell” process. Specially developed test stands, software and tooling provide the framework for this accelerated delivery process. Customers that choose the “ship-from-cell” process substantially improve their delivery times while receiving the same high level of quality provided by more traditional, longer cycle integration techniques. Product margins and inventory turns also improve because of shorter factory cycle times and increased labor productivity.
​
Installation of our equipment is provided by factory and field teams. The process includes assembling the equipment at our installation site, and after it has been connected, recalibrating it to factory specifications.

Competition
​
The semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive and is characterized by a small number of participants ranging in size. Significant competitive factors in the semiconductor capital equipment market include price, cost of ownership, equipment performance, customer support, capabilities, and breadth of product line. 
​
In the market for ion implantation systems, we mainly compete against Applied Materials, Inc. (“Applied Materials”). Axcelis and Applied Materials are the only ion implant system manufacturers with a full range of implant products.  Other implantation equipment manufacturers we compete with include Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ion Technology Co. Ltd. and Nissin Ion Equipment Co., Ltd in Japan, Advanced Ion Beam Technology, Inc. in Taiwan, as well as Kingstone Semiconductor and CETC Electronics Equipment Group Co., Ltd. in the People’s Republic of China. Non-U.S. suppliers may have an advantage over U.S. suppliers under recently established U.S. export controls regulation for shipments to China.  We also provide aftermarket service and parts to service our customers globally. In this market, there are many competitors, often based in the customer’s location, offering alternatives to Axcelis services and certified products.
​
Intellectual Property
​
We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection in the United States and in other countries, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our proprietary rights in our products and our business. As of December 31, 2024, we had 185 active patents issued in the United States and 349 active patents granted in other countries, as well as 160 patent applications (58 in the United States and 102 in other countries) on file with various patent agencies worldwide. Patents are generally in effect for up to 20 years from the filing of the application.
​
We intend to file additional patent applications and grow our intellectual property portfolio as appropriate. Although patents are important to our business, we do not believe that we are substantially dependent on any single patent or any group of patents.
​
We have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that are maintained to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace. Trademark registrations generally remain in effect as long as the trademarks are in use. From time to time, we enter into license agreements with third parties under which we obtain or grant rights to patented or proprietary technology. We do not believe that any of our licenses are currently material to us. 
​
Backlog
​
Systems backlog, including deferred systems revenue, was $645.8 million and $1,061.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The systems backlog amount at December 2023 reflects a correction reported in our Form 8-K filed on November 6, 2024. We believe it is meaningful to investors to include deferred systems revenue as part of our backlog. Deferred systems revenue represents revenue that will be recognized in future periods based on prior shipments or customer prepayments. Our policy is to include in backlog only those system orders for which we have accepted purchase orders. All orders are subject to cancellations or rescheduling by customers with limited or no penalties.
​
Backlog does not include orders received and fulfilled within a quarter. Our backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all orders required to achieve our sales objectives for that quarter. Backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future business trends because orders for services or parts received during the quarter are generally performed or shipped within the same quarter.
​
Bookings in the quarter ended December 31, 2024 were $84.5 million compared to $235.5 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2023.
​
Human Capital 
​
As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,524 employees and 39 agency temporary staff worldwide.  During 2024, our total employee and temporary staff headcount decreased by approximately 8%. While the majority of our headcount is 
8

Table of Contents
based in the U.S. at our main manufacturing facility in Beverly, Massachusetts, our business requires our presence where our customers are located around the world, resulting in Axcelis employees working in 28 different countries. Of our total year end 2024 employees and agency temporary staff, 1,081 work in North America, 396 in Asia and 86 in Europe.
​
Our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled

employees. We

provide competitive compensation and benefits programs. In addition to salaries, all Axcelis employees are eligible for cash incentive programs with annual payouts tied to annual financial metrics, as described in our proxy statements, with two exceptions: (i) certain sales staff receive commission and other sales compensation, and (ii) in order to provide greater certainty of compensation to lower level U.S. employees, we pay quarterly bonuses to those employees in amounts communicated at the start of the year.  Beyond these basic forms of cash compensation, we offer recognition bonuses, equity awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) plan with a competitive employer match, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs, and tuition assistance.  These programs all contribute to both attracting and retaining a highly skilled employee base, including those with critical leadership and industry skills and experience.
​
During 2024, our voluntary turnover rate for employees was 9.1%, or 6.5% without retirements, below the worldwide technology industry (all reported) voluntary turnover average of 11.4% reported in the Aon 2024 Salary Increase and Turnover Study -- December 2024.
​
We also recognize that training is an important aspect of both employee retention and talent development. Axcelis conducts an annual talent review process and establishes individualized development programs agreed upon by employees and their managers.  Human Resources provides training on personal development planning and leadership skills.  All Axcelis employees have access to LinkedIn Learning to pursue independent training on business subjects.  Our manufacturing staff each receives 35 hours of training upon commencement of employment, and our field service and other technical employees receive training on various ion implanter systems to develop product support, applications and service skills on all of our products.  Finally, all staff are required to complete monthly, annual or biennial training on cybersecurity, various health and safety topics, and legal matters, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls compliance, ethical business practices, and confidentiality.  At a minimum, all Axcelis employees are required to complete at least 15 hours of training per year, and they can access additional voluntary training at the Company’s expense.
​
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to health and wellness insurance and programs that offer choice

where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, we have maintained flexible working opportunities for those employees who can, and wish to, work remotely. This flexibility allows us to access workers who do not live near our facilities and provides a desired quality of life benefit to those who wish to work remotely for personal reasons. 
​
Axcelis is dedicated to accessing a workforce that has the skills and qualities required for our jobs, fostering a culture built on the principle of inclusion, and maintaining a workplace free from discrimination. We strongly believe that a the experiences, perspectives and backgrounds of our entire workforce will lead to a better environment for our employees and better products for our customers.  Axcelis’ commitment extends to our Board of Directors, our leadership team and all teams and functions across our global locations.
