​
Overview
​
The semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to cyclical swings in capital spending by semiconductor chip manufacturers. Capital spending is influenced by demand for semiconductors and the products using them, the utilization rate and capacity of existing semiconductor chip manufacturing facilities and changes in semiconductor technology, all of which are outside of our control. As a result, our revenue may fluctuate from year to year and period to period. Our established cost structure does not vary significantly with changes in volume. We may also experience fluctuations in operating results and cash flows depending on our revenue level.
​
Revenue for 2024 was $1,017.9 million, compared to $1,130.6 million in 2023. Systems revenue for 2024 was $782.6 million, compared to $883.6 million in 2023. Gross margin percent for the year was 44.7% compared to 43.5% in 2023. Operating profit was $210.8 million in 2024, compared to $265.8 million in 2023. Net income for the year was $201.0 million, compared to $246.3 million in 2023.
​
The Company is in a strong competitive position. A focused strategy on ion implant, combined with the hard work and dedication of our employees and the encouragement and support of our customers and suppliers, enabled us to achieve numerous critical milestones in our drive to market leadership. Important accomplishments in 2024 included:
​
●
We delivered revenue of $1,017.9 million in 2024 and earnings per share of $6.15.  
●
We remained a technology leader and supplier of choice in the implant-intensive power device segment, which accounted for 56% of the value of our 2024 system shipments.
●
We continued working to expand our footprint with existing and new customers and currently have two Purion evaluation systems in the field at strategic customer sites in key market segments.
●
We continued our investment in our Customer Solutions & Innovation (“CS&I”) aftermarket business to drive financial growth and increased customer satisfaction levels, including the “Digital Tool Box,” an innovative service offering with online training, remote diagnosis and install, and automated troubleshooting guide.  
●
We received 22 customer satisfaction awards in 2024.  In addition, Axcelis was named to both the 2023 and 2024 editions of Forbes’ List of America’s Best Mid-Cap Companies and to both the Fortune Magazine’s 2023 and 2024 lists of the Top 100 Fastest Growing Companies.    
​
We continue to work diligently to ensure that manufacturing and operating expense levels remain well aligned to business conditions. 
​
The market for our systems and aftermarket products and services is represented by a relatively small number of companies. In 2024, the top 20 semiconductor chip manufacturers accounted for approximately 87.6% of total semiconductor capital equipment spending, down from 92.0% in 2023. Our net revenue from our ten largest customers accounted for 45.9% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 51.7% and 59.4% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2024, no customers represented ten percent or more of total revenue.

Table of Contents
Critical Accounting Estimates
​
Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon Axcelis’ consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Management’s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
​
We believe the following accounting policies are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For additional accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
​
Revenue Recognition
​
Our accounting policies relating to the recognition of revenue require management to make estimates, determinations and judgments based on historical experience and on various other assumptions, which include (i) the existence of a contract with the customer, (ii) the identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) the value of any variable consideration in the contract, (iv) the standalone selling price of multiple obligations in the contract, for the purpose of allocating the consideration in the contract, and (v) determining when a performance obligation has been met. Our revenue recognition policies are set forth in section (j) of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Recognition of revenue based on incorrect judgments, including an erroneous allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting, could result in inappropriate recognition of revenue, or incorrect timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
​
Inventory—Provision for Excess and Obsolescence and Lower of Cost or Net Realizable Value
​
We record a provision for estimated excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value. The provision is determined using management’s assumptions of materials usage, based on estimates of forecasted and historical demand and market conditions. Specifically, our assumptions of forecasted system sales and the size and utilization of the installed base of systems may have a significant effect on estimated materials usage. If actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
​
Although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts or product demand and pricing assumptions, any significant unanticipated changes in demand, pricing, or technical developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results. In the future, if we determine that inventory needs to be written down, we will recognize such costs in our cost of revenue at the time of such determination. If we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down, our gross margin in that period will be favorably impacted.
​
Product Warranty
​
We generally offer a one-year warranty for all of our systems, the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold. For all systems sold, we accrue a liability for the estimated cost of standard warranty at the time of system shipment and defer the portion of systems revenue attributable to the relative fair value of non-standard warranty. Costs for non-standard warranty are expensed as incurred. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical and anticipated product failure rates, material usage and service labor costs. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded liability and adjust the amount as necessary.
​
24

Table of Contents
Income Taxes
​
We record income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
​
We establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against those net deferred tax assets.
​
We evaluate the weight of all available evidence such as historical losses, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and projected future taxable income to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
​
Our income tax expense includes the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. Settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as operating expense.

Product
​
Product revenue, which includes new system sales, sales of spare parts, product upgrades and used system sales was $976.9 million or 96.0% of revenue in 2024, compared with $1,095.7 million or 96.9% of revenue in 2023. The decrease in product revenue in 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in the number of Purion systems sold.
​
26

Table of Contents
A portion of our revenue from system sales is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed. The total amount of deferred revenue at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $138.2 million and $210.9 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in system prepayments.
​
Services
​
Services revenue, which includes the labor component of maintenance and service contracts and fees for service hours provided by on-site service personnel, was $41.0 million, or 4.0% of revenue for 2024, compared with $35.0 million, or 3.1% of revenue for 2023. Although services revenue typically increases with the expansion of the installed base of systems, it can fluctuate from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers’ manufacturing facilities, which affects the need for equipment service.
​
Revenue Categories used by Management
​
In addition to the line-item revenue categories discussed above, management also uses revenue categorizations which break down revenue into other groupings. Management regularly disaggregates revenue in the following categories, which it finds relevant and useful:
​
●
Systems and Customer Solutions and Innovation (“CS&I”, or “aftermarket”) revenue is 
​
A.
The portion of Product revenue relating to spare parts, product upgrades and used systems combined with; 
B.
Service revenue, which is the labor component of aftermarket revenues
​
Aftermarket revenue reflects current fab utilization as opposed to System revenue, which reflects capital investment decisions by our customers, which have differing economic drivers; 
​
●
Revenue by geographic regions, since economic factors impacting customer purchasing decisions may vary by geographic region; and
​
●
Revenue by our customers’ end markets, since they tend to be subject to different economic environments at different periods of time, impacting a customer’s likelihood of purchasing capital equipment during any particular period; currently, management uses three end market categories: Memory, mature process technology and leading edge foundry and logic.  
​
The CS&I/aftermarket revenue categories for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are discussed below. 
​
CS&I/Aftermarket 
​
Revenue from our aftermarket business was $235.3 million in 2024, compared to $247.0 million for 2023. Aftermarket revenue generally increases with the expansion of the installed base of systems but can fluctuate from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers’ manufacturing facilities which affects the sale of spare parts and demand for equipment service.

Our ability to remain competitive depends largely on continuously developing innovative technology, with new and enhanced features and systems and introducing them at competitive prices on a timely basis. Accordingly, based on our strategic plan, we establish annual research and development budgets to fund programs that we expect will drive competitive advantages.
​
Research and development (“R&D”) expense was $105.5 million in 2024, an increase of $8.6 million, or 8.9%, compared with $96.9 million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased outside services, materials and supplies expense to support ongoing R&D projects as well as higher personnel expenses associated with an increase in wages and benefits partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense and temporary employee expenses.

Our sales and marketing expenses result primarily from the sale of our equipment and services through our direct sales force.
​
Sales and marketing expense was $68.0 million in 2024, an increase of $5.2 million, or 8.3%, compared with $62.8 million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel expenses associated with an increase in wages and stock compensation partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense.

Our general and administrative expenses result primarily from the costs associated with our executive, finance, information technology, legal and human resource functions.
​
General and administrative expense was $70.3 million in 2024, an increase of $4.5 million, or 6.9%, compared with $65.8 million in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher bad debt expense and higher personnel expenses associated with an increase in wages and benefits partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense.
​
Other Income (Expense)
​
Other income (expense) consists of interest earned and accretion on our invested cash balances, interest expense relating to the finance lease obligation we incurred in connection with the 2015 sale of our headquarters facility (“sale

Income tax expense was $29.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $32.3 million in 2023. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 12.7% compared to 11.6% for year the ended December 31, 2023.  The increase in the effective tax rate in 2024 is primarily due to a decrease in the benefit associated with stock-based compensation. 
​
Liquidity and Capital Resources
​
Our liquidity is affected by many factors. Some of these relate specifically to the operations of our business. For example, our sales and other factors are influenced by the uncertainties of global economies, including the availability of credit and the condition of the overall semiconductor capital equipment industry. Our industry requires ongoing investments in operations and research and development that are not easily adjusted to reflect changes in revenue. As a result, profitability and cash flows can fluctuate more widely than revenue.
​
In 2024, $140.8 million of cash was provided by operating activities. This compares to $156.9 million of cash provided by operations in 2023. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 was $123.5 million, compared to $167.3 million at December 31, 2023. Approximately $41.8 million of cash was located in foreign jurisdictions as of December 31, 2024. In addition to the cash and cash equivalent balance at December 31, 2024, we had $7.6 million in restricted cash which relates to a $5.9 million cash collateral relating to our lease for our headquarters in Beverly, Massachusetts, a $0.9 million letter of credit for customs purposes, a $0.7 million letter of credit relating to workers’ compensation insurance and a $0.1 million deposit relating to customs activity. Working capital at December 31, 2024 was $916.1 million. At December 31, 2024, we had no bank debt.
​
In 2024, $108.7 million of cash was used in investing activities, $12.2 million of which was used for capital expenditures. We used $539.1 million of cash for purchases of short-term investments in 2024, partially offset by maturities of short-term investment of $442.6 million. We held $447.8 million of short-term investments at December 31, 2024. These short-term investments consist of U.S. Government securities and agency investments. In 2023, $100.9 million of cash was used in investing activities, $20.7 million of which was used for capital expenditures. We used $388.8 million of cash for purchases of short-term investments in 2023, partially offset by maturities of short-term investments of $308.6 million. Total capital expenditures for 2025 are projected to be approximately $20 million. Future capital expenditures beyond 2025

will depend on a number of factors, including the timing and rate of expansion of our business and our ability to generate cash to fund them.
​
Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $71.2 million, which consisted of $60.5 million related to our stock repurchase program, $11.6 million related to net settlement of restricted stock issuances and $1.5 million related to principal reduction on our finance lease. These amounts were partially offset by $2.4 million in proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing activities was $68.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which consisted of $52.5 million related to our stock repurchase program, $16.6 million related to net settlement of restricted stock issuances, and $1.2 million of principal reduction on our finance lease. These amounts were partially offset by $2.1 million in proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan. 
​
We have outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and deposits in the amount of $17.5 million to cover the security deposit under the lease of our headquarters, our workers’ compensation insurance program, customs and bank deposits and certain value added tax claims in Europe.

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2024. See Note 18 – Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to our unrecognized tax benefits.
​
We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon. As of December 31, 2024, there was no cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business. Upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we could be subject to withholding taxes payable to the various foreign tax jurisdictions.
​
Under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we qualify as a “well-known seasoned issuer,” which allows us to file shelf registration statements to register an unspecified amount of securities that are effective upon filing. On August 3, 2023, we filed such a shelf registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, various series of debt securities and/or warrants to purchase any of such securities, either individually or in units, from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offering. This registration statement was effective upon filing and will expire in August 2026. We may file another shelf registration statement to maintain the availability of this financing option.

We have a cash collateralized letter of credit of $5.9 million, which is classified as long-term restricted cash on our balance sheet at December 31, 2024.   
​
We believe that based on our current market, revenue, expense and cash flow forecasts, our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the short and long-term.

There are no significant related-party transactions that require disclosure in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, or in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

​
Item 
7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
​
Interest Rate Sensitivity
​
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, which consists of cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2024. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal. This is accomplished by investing in marketable investment grade securities. We do not use derivative financial instruments in managing our investment portfolio. Due to the nature of our investments, we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by any change in market interest rates.
​
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
​
Substantially all of our sales are billed in U.S. dollars, thereby reducing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on our results. We are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating margins of certain foreign operations can fluctuate with changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent revenue is billed in U.S. dollars and operating expenses are incurred in the local currency. We have entered forward exchange contracts in order to mitigate risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates on forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows. These contracts have month-to-month settlement dates. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 6.2% and 5.8% of our revenue, respectively, were derived in local currencies from foreign operations with this inherent risk. In addition, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, our operations outside the United States accounted for approximately 9.2% and 9.4% of our total assets, respectively, the majority of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
​
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
​
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
​
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
​
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
​
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) Internal Control—2013 Integrated Framework.
​
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
​
The independent registered public accounting firm of Ernst & Young LLP, as auditors of our consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.

​
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
​
We have audited Axcelis Technologies, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. 
​
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
​
Basis for Opinion
​
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
​
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  
​
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
​
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
​
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
​
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Axcelis Technologies, Inc.
​
Opinion on the Financial Statements
​
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  
​
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
​
Adoption of ASU 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280)
​
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its segment disclosures in 2024 and 2023 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting.
​
Basis for Opinion 
​
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
​
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
​
Critical Audit Matters
​
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
Systems Revenue recognition

​
Description of the Matter
​
As discussed in Note 2 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generates revenue from the sale of ion implantation and other processing equipment used in the manufacture of semiconductor chips (“systems revenue”). The Company’s revenue contracts for systems have multiple performance obligations, including the systems themselves and obligations that are not delivered simultaneously with the systems. Systems revenue accounted for $782.6 million of the Company’s total revenue of $1.0 billion in 2024.
​
38

Table of Contents
Auditing management’s recognition of revenue was challenging because of the higher extent of audit effort and because the amounts are material to the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. During our risk assessment process, we identified a higher inherent risk related to revenue primarily due to the size of the account, as well as the focus on revenue from readers of the financial statements.
​
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
​
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s systems revenue recognition process, including controls designed to mitigate the risk of override of controls. This included testing controls over management’s review of manual journal entries and revenue related account reconciliations. 
​
To test systems revenue recognition, we reconciled revenue recognized to the Company’s general ledger to test completeness and performed substantive test of details over significant transactions deemed to be key items and a representative sample of the remaining transactions.   For example, we selected and read a sample of arrangements to evaluate the completeness of the promised products and services and the related revenue recognized. We also confirmed directly with certain of the Company’s customers the terms of the selected system revenue arrangements.

Estimate of Excess Inventory
​
Description of the Matter
​
The Company’s inventories totaled $282.2 million, net, as of December 31, 2024. As described in Note 2 and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records a provision for estimated excess inventory. Management determines the provision using its assumptions of future materials usage, based on estimates of demand and market conditions.
​
Auditing the Company’s provision for excess inventory is complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the factors used to estimate demand and market conditions. Specifically, the Company’s estimated materials usage may be significantly affected by management’s assumptions of forecasted system sales and the size and utilization of the installed base of systems. Management’s identification and measurement of these factors are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions that could have a significant effect on the excess inventory reserve.
​
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
​
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls, including management review controls, over the Company’s excess inventory reserve estimation process. This included management’s assessment of the assumptions and data underlying the excess inventory provision. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of its systems sales forecasts, as well as management’s review of the assumptions relating to the market size and utilization of installed systems. We also tested management’s controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the estimation model.

​
Our substantive audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions stated above and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used by management to compute the value of excess inventory. For example, we compared the quantities of on-hand inventories to historical and forecasted materials usage and evaluated adjustments to forecasts for specific product considerations, such as technological changes or alternative uses. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses over the significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the excess inventory estimates that would result from changes in the underlying assumptions.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
​
Note 1. Nature of Business
​
Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (“Axcelis” “We” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware in 1995, and is a worldwide producer of ion implantation and other processing equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductor chips in the United States, Europe and Asia. In addition to equipment, we provide extensive aftermarket lifecycle products and services, including spare parts, equipment upgrades, maintenance services and customer training.
​
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
​
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and elsewhere in the footnotes.
​
(a)          Basis of Presentation
​
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned, controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
​
Events occurring subsequent to December 31, 2024 have been evaluated for potential recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.
​
(b)          Use of Estimates
​
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, the realizable value of accounts receivable and inventories, warranty reserves, valuing stock-based compensation instruments and reserves relating to tax assets and liabilities. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.
​
(c)          Foreign Currency
​
The functional currency for substantially all operations outside the United States is the local currency. Financial statements for these operations are translated into United States dollars at year-end rates as to assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the year as to revenue and expenses. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders’ equity as an element of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
​
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 we had foreign exchange losses of $
9.1
 million, $
0.5
 million, and $
6.6
 million, respectively.
​
(d)          Derivative Instruments
​
We are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have entered into forward exchange contracts in order to mitigate risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates on forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows. These contracts have month-to-month settlement dates. As of December 31, 2024, we had open contracts with a notional value of $
112.0
 million. We measure these instruments at fair value and recognize assets or liabilities associated with the fair value on these open contracts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the end of each reporting period. At December 31, 2024, the recognized unrealized gain 
45

Table of Contents
on these forward exchange contracts was approximately $
0.3
 million. Unrealized gains and losses are shown in our cash flows from operating activities within our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We have not designated these forward exchange contracts as hedging instruments and we record changes in the fair values at each measurement date in Other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded $
9.1
 million of gain on forward currency exchange contracts.
​
We do not offset fair value amounts of derivative instruments. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
​
(e)          Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
​
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds, U.S. Government and Agency Securities and deposit accounts. Cash equivalents are carried on the balance sheet at fair market value. Short-term investments are h
ighly liquid investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days but less than one year from date of purchase and are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost. Our short-term investments consist primarily of U.S. Government and Agency securities and are classified as held-to-maturity based on our positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Income related to these securities is recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
.
​
(f)          Inventories
​
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, determined using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. We periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary for estimated obsolescence or damaged goods to ensure values approximate lower of cost or net realizable value. The amount of such markdowns is equal to the difference between cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demands, selling prices, and market conditions.
​
We record a provision for estimated excess inventory. The provision is determined using management’s assumptions of materials usage, based on estimates of demand, market conditions, and the size and utilization of our installed base. If actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
​
(g)          Property, Plant and Equipment and Leased Assets
​
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
​
On January 30, 2015, we sold our corporate headquarters facility. As part of this sale, we also entered into a 
22-year
 lease agreement. We accounted for the sale leaseback transaction as a financing arrangement for financial reporting purposes. We retained the historical costs of the property and the related accumulated depreciation on our financial books within property, plant and equipment and will continue to depreciate the property for financial reporting purposes over the lesser of its remaining useful life or its initial lease term of 
22 years
. 
​
Depreciation and amortization are recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
Asset Classification

Estimated Useful Life
Land, buildings and equipment (under lease)

​
Lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset
​
​
Machinery and equipment

​
3
 to 
10 years
​
​
​
Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures greater than $
2.5
 thousand for renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives.
​

(h)          Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
​
We record impairment losses on long-lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that these assets might not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by a comparison of the assets’ carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.
​
We did not have any indicators of impairment during the period ending December 31, 2024. We did 
no
t record an impairment charge in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.
​
Actual performance could be materially different from our current forecasts, which could impact estimates of undiscounted cash flows and may result in the impairment of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets in the future. This could be caused by strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, or a material adverse change in our relationships with significant customers. 
​
 (i)         Concentration of Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk
​
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are principally maintained in investment grade money-market funds, U.S. Government and Agency Securities and deposit accounts.
​
Other than our currency exchange contracts, we have no significant off-balance sheet risk relating to option contracts or other hedging arrangements.
​
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to cash equivalents and short-term investments. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal without significantly increasing risk. This is accomplished by investing in marketable investment grade securities. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage our investment portfolio and do not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by any change in market interest rates.
​
We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally require no collateral to secure accounts receivable. For selected overseas sales, we require customers to obtain letters of credit before product is shipped. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectability of accounts receivable. We review the allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly. We do not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers.
​
Our customers consist of semiconductor chip manufacturers located throughout the world and net sales to our 
ten
 largest customers accounted for 
45.9
%, 
51.7
% and 
59.4
% of revenue in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
​
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 
no
 customers representing 
10
% or greater of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had 
two
 customers representing 
13.1
% and 
11.5
% of total revenue, respectively. 
​
As of December 31, 2024, we had 
one
 customer account for 
10.0
% of consolidated accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023, we had 
one
 customer account for 
12.2
% of consolidated accounts receivable. 
​
Some of the components and sub-assemblies included in our products are obtained either from a sole source or a limited group of suppliers. Disruption to our supply source, resulting either from economic conditions or other factors, could affect our ability to deliver products to our customers.
​
(j)          Revenue Recognition
​
We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
or (“ASC 606”). Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of 
47

Table of Contents
promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We measure revenue based on the consideration specified in the customer arrangement, and revenue is recognized when the performance obligations in the customer arrangement are satisfied. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to the customer. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based upon the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the customer receives the benefit of the performance obligation. To account for and measure revenue, we apply the following five steps:
​
1)
Identify the contract with the customer
​
A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the related payment terms, (ii) the contract has commercial substance, and (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. 
​
2)
Identify the performance obligations in the contract
​
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other available resources, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods and services, we must apply judgment to determine whether promised goods and services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods and services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.
​
Systems sales consist of multiple performance obligations, including the system itself and obligations that are not delivered simultaneously with the system. These undelivered obligations might include a combination of installation services, extended warranty and support and spare parts, all of which are generally covered by a single sales price.
​
The Aftermarket business includes both products and services type arrangements. Performance obligations in these contracts consist of used tools, spare parts, equipment upgrades, maintenance services and customer training. 
​
Customers who purchase new systems are provided an assurance-type warranty for 
one year
 after acceptance of the tool. For aftermarket transactions, we provide customers an assurance-type warranty for 
90 days
. Customers can choose to purchase extended warranty terms with enhanced support similar to a service-type warranty ranging from 
one
 to 
three years
. In accordance with ASC 606, assurance-type warranties are not considered a performance obligation, whereas service-type warranties are.  
​
3)
Determine the transaction price 
​
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Any estimates, including the effect of the constraint on variable consideration, are evaluated at each reporting period for any changes. In applying this guidance, Companies must also consider whether any significant financing components exist. 
​
The transaction price for all transactions is based on the price reflected in the individual customer’s purchase order. Variable consideration has not been identified as a significant component of the transaction price for any of our transactions. 
​
For those transactions where all performance obligations will be satisfied within one year or less, we apply the 
48

Table of Contents
practical expedient outlined in ASC 606-10-32-18. This practical expedient allows us not to adjust promised consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect at contract inception that the period between when we transfer the promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. For those transactions that are expected to be completed after one year, we have assessed that there are no significant financing components because any difference between the promised consideration and the cash selling price of the good or service is for reasons other than the provision of financing. 
​
4)
Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract
​
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. 
​
Where required, we determine standalone selling price (“SSP”) for each obligation based on consideration of both market and Company specific factors, including the selling price and profit margin for similar products, the cost to produce, and the anticipated margin.
​
For those contracts that contain multiple performance obligations (primarily systems sales, as well as some aftermarket contracts requiring both time and material inputs), we must determine the SSP. We use a cost plus margin approach in determining the SSP for any materials related performance obligations (such as upgrades, spare parts, systems). To determine the SSP for labor related performance obligations (such as the labor component of installation), we use directly observable inputs based on the standalone sale prices for these services. 
​
5)
Recognize revenue when or as we have satisfied a performance obligation 
​
We satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized over time if either 1) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance, 2) the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or 3) the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. If the entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the related performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time by transferring the control of a promised good or service to a customer. Examples of control are using the asset to produce goods or services, enhance the value of other assets or settle liabilities, and holding or selling the asset. For over time recognition, ASC 606 requires us to select a single revenue recognition method for the performance obligation that faithfully depicts our performance in transferring control of the goods and services. The guidance allows entities to choose between two methods to measure progress toward complete satisfaction of a performance obligation: 
​
Output methods - recognize revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contract (e.g., surveys of performance completed to date, appraisals of results achieved, milestones reached, time elapsed, and units produced or units delivered); and 
​
Input methods - recognize revenue on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation (e.g., resources consumed, labor hours expended, costs incurred, or time elapsed) relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation.
​
We have the right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity’s performance completed to date (i.e., certain aftermarket contracts), as such we have elected a practical expedient to recognize revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice for such services.
​
Product related revenues (whether for systems or aftermarket business) are recognized at a point in time, when they are shipped or delivered, depending on shipping terms.  
49

Table of Contents
​
For installation services, revenue is recognized at a point in time, once the installation of the tool is complete. The nature of the installation services is such that the customer does not simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the entity’s performance, nor does performance of installation services create or enhance an asset that the customer controls. Installation services do not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity, and the entity does not have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.  
​
Contract liabilities are reflected as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. Contract liabilities relate to payments invoiced or received in advance of completion of performance obligations under a contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue upon the fulfillment of performance obligations.
​
Service-type warranties for any product are recognized over time, as these represent a stand ready obligation to service the product during the warranty period. Progress in the satisfaction of these performance obligations is measured using an input method of time elapsed. 
​
Maintenance and service contracts are recognized over time.  Progress in the satisfaction of these performance obligations is measured using an input method of either time elapsed in the case of fixed period contracts, or labor hours expended, in the case of project-based contracts.
​
(k)          Recognizing Assets related to Recoverable Customer Contract Costs
We recognize an asset related to incremental costs incurred by us to obtain a contract with a customer if we expect to recover those costs. We will recognize an asset from costs incurred to fulfill a contract only if such costs relate directly to a contract with an entity that we can specifically identify, the costs incurred will generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future, and the costs are expected to be recovered. Any assets recognized related to costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates.
In substantially all of our business transactions, we incur incremental costs to obtain contracts with customers, in the form of sales commissions. We maintain a commission program which awards our employees for System sales, aftermarket activity and other individual goals. Under ASC 606, an asset is amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. However, ASC 606 provides a practical expedient to allow for the recognition of commission expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Based on the nature of our commission agreements, all commissions are expensed as incurred based upon the expectation that the amortization period would be one year or less.  
​
(l)          Shipping and Handling Costs
​
Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenue.
​
(m)          Stock-Based Compensation
​
We generally recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units, based on the grant-date fair value of those stock-based payments. For stock option awards, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Other valuation models may be utilized in the limited circumstances where awards with market-based vesting considerations, such as the price of our common stock, or performance-based awards, are granted. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period. For each stock option or restricted stock unit grant with vesting based on a combination of time, market or performance conditions, where vesting will occur if either condition is met, the related compensation costs are recognized over the shorter of the explicit service period or the derived service period.
​
See Note 13 for additional information relating to stock-based compensation.
​
50

Table of Contents
(n)         Income Taxes
​
We record income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
​
We establish a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets is reduced based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against those net deferred tax assets. We evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
​
Income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. Settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions, or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties within operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
​
See Note 18 for additional information relating to income taxes.
​
(o)         Computation of Net Income per Share
​
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding (the denominator) for the period. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive shares of common stock had been issued, calculated using the treasury stock method.
​
The components of net income per share are as follows:

(q)         Recent Accounting Guidance
In November 2023 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 ("ASU 2023-07"). ASU 2023-07 is intended to enhance disclosures for significant segment expenses for all public entities required to report segment information in accordance with ASC Topic 280, 
Segment Reporting
 ("ASC 280"). ASC 280 requires a public entity to report for each reportable segment a measure of segment profit or loss that its chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) uses to assess segment performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. ASU 2023-07 is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to develop more useful financial analyses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted ASU 2023-07 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K and we applied the update retrospectively for all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. 
See Note 17 for 
related disclosures.
In December 2023 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
("ASU 2023-09")
. 
ASU 2023-09 is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 addresses investor requests for enhanced income tax information primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. Early adoption is permitted. A public entity should apply ASU 2023-09 prospectively to all annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its future consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2024 the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2024-03, 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
 (“ASU 2024-03”). ASU 2024-03 is intended to enhance the disclosures for expenses for all public entities in accordance with ASC Topic 220, 
Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income
. ASU 2024-03 addresses investor requests for more detailed information about expenses, specifically cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”). ASU 2024-03 requires a public entity to disclose the amounts of (a) purchases of inventory, (b) employee compensation, (c) depreciation, (d) intangible asset amortization, and (e) depreciation, depletion, and amortization recognized as part of oil- and gas-producing activities (or other amounts of depletion expense) included in each relevant expense caption presented on the face of the income statement as well as a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in the relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively. ASU 2024-03 also requires a public entity to disclose the total amount of selling expenses and the entity’s definition of selling expenses. 
ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. A public entity should apply ASU 2024-03 either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2024-03 on its future consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

(a)
Alternative Operational Revenue Categories used by Management
​
To reflect the organization of our business operations, management reviews revenue in two categories: revenue from sales of new systems and revenue arising from the sale of used systems, parts and labor to customers who own systems, which we refer to as Customer Solutions & Innovation (“CS&I”) or “aftermarket.” 
​
Below are the revenues by categories used by management for the periods covered in this report:

Economic Factors Affecting our Revenue: Geographic Breakdown of Revenue
​
Global economic conditions have a direct impact on our revenue. We are substantially dependent on sales of our products and services to customers outside of the United States. Adverse economic conditions, political instability, potential adverse tax consequences, regulatory changes and volatility in exchange rates pose a risk that our clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending for our products and services, which would impact our revenue. 
​
Revenue by geographic markets is determined based upon the location to which our products are shipped and where our services are performed. Revenue in our principal geographic markets is as follows:

* Amount is net of a reclassification of $

 million from deferred revenue to refund liability for the year ended December 31, 2024.
​
Contract liabilities are reflected as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. Contract liabilities relate to payments received or amounts invoiced in advance of completion of performance obligations under a contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue upon the fulfillment of performance obligations. 
​
As of December 31, 2024, we had deferred revenue of $
138.2

million. This represents the portion of the transaction price for contracts with customers allocated to the performance obligations that remain unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied.  Short-term deferred revenue of 
$
94.7
 million as of December 31, 2024 represents performance obligations that are expected to be satisfied within the next 12 months. This amount relates primarily to prepayments made prior to system delivery as well as to installation and non-standard warranty performance obligations for system sales. Long-term deferred revenue of $
43.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 relates to prepayments made prior to system delivery as well as to extended warranty performance obligations that we expect to be completed in excess of the next 12 months but within the next 
24 months
. 
​
The majority of our system transactions have either (1) payment terms that are 
90
% due upon shipment of the system and 
10
% due upon acceptance or (2) a pre-shipment deposit ranging from 
20
% to 
60
%, with the remainder due upon shipment, less 
10
% due at acceptance. Aftermarket transaction payment terms are such that payment is due either within 
30
 or 
60 days
 of service provided or parts delivered.

​
Note 5. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses
​
All trade receivables are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their amortized cost adjusted for any write-offs and net of allowances for credit losses. 
​
Axcelis maintains an allowance for credit losses, which represents an estimate of expected losses over the remaining contractual life of its receivables considering current market conditions and estimates for supportable forecasts when 
54

Table of Contents
appropriate. The estimate is a result of the Company’s ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability, historical loss experience, and future expectations in estimating credit losses in its receivable portfolio. Axcelis uses historical loss experience rates and applies them to a related aging analysis while also considering customer and/or economic risk where appropriate. Determination of the proper amount of allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, as a result, net earnings. The allowance takes into consideration numerous quantitative and qualitative factors that include receivable type, historical loss experience, delinquency trends, collection experience, current economic conditions, estimates for supportable forecasts, when appropriate, and credit risk characteristics. 
​
Axcelis evaluates the credit risk of the customer when extending credit based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that may affect its customers’ ability to pay. These factors may include the customer’s financial condition, past payment experience, and credit ratings from credit bureaus, as well as the value of the underlying collateral.
​
Management performs detailed reviews of its receivables on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowances and to determine if any impairment has occurred. Amounts determined to be uncollectable are charged directly against the allowance, while amounts recovered on previously written-off accounts increase the allowance. Changes to the allowance for credit losses are maintained through adjustments to the provision for credit losses, which are charged to current period earnings.
​
The following table shows changes of the allowances for credit losses related to trade receivables for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

We regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of inventories based on a combination of factors including the following: forecasted sales and the size and utilization of our installed base,

estimated product end of life dates, estimated current and future market value and new product introductions. Purchasing and usage alternatives are also explored to mitigate inventory exposure. In 2024, we recorded an increase of $
0.6
 million in inventory reserves. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, inventories are stated net of inventory reserves of $

Note 9. Leases
​
We have operating leases for manufacturing, office space, warehouse space, computer and office equipment and vehicles used in our business operations. We have a finance lease in relation to the 2015 sale-leaseback of our corporate headquarters in Beverly, Massachusetts. We review all agreements to determine if the agreement contains a lease component. An agreement contains a lease component if it provides the use of a specific physical space or a specific physical item. 
56

Table of Contents
​
We recognize operating lease obligations under Accounting Standards Codification - 
Leases
 (Topic 842). The guidance in Topic 842 requires recognition of lease assets and related liabilities on a discounted basis using the explicit or implicit discount rate stated within the agreement. We recognize a corresponding right-of-use asset, which is initially determined based upon the net present value of the associated liability and is adjusted for deferred costs and possible impairment, if any. For those lease agreements that do not indicate the applicable discount rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate. The value of the right-of-use asset is initially determined based on the net present value of the associated liability, and is adjusted for deferred costs and possible impairments, if any. We have made the following policy elections: (i) operating leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet; (ii) we recognize lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term; and (iii) we account for lease components and non-lease components that are fixed payments as one component. Some of our operating leases include one or more 
options to renew
, with renewal terms that can extend the respective lease term 
1
 to 
3 years
. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. For lease extensions that are reasonably certain to occur, we have included the renewal periods in our calculation of the net present value of the lease obligation and related right-of-use asset. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of certain assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The amounts of operating and finance lease right-of-use assets and related lease obligations recorded within our consolidated balance sheets are as follows:

Note 10. Product Warranty
​
We generally offer a 
one-year
 warranty for all of our systems, the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold. For all systems sold, we accrue a liability for the estimated cost of standard warranty at the time of system shipment and defer the portion of systems revenue attributable to the fair value of non-standard warranty. Costs for non-standard warranty are expensed as incurred. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical and anticipated product failure rates, material usage and service labor costs. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded liability and adjust the amount as necessary.

Note 11. Financing Arrangements
​
On January 30, 2015, we sold our corporate headquarters facility for the sale price of $
48.9
 million. As part of the sale, we also entered into a 
22-year
 lease agreement with the buyer. The sale leaseback is accounted for as a financing arrangement for financial reporting purposes and, as such, we recorded a financing obligation of $
43.7
 million as of December 31, 2024, $
1.3
 million of which is classified within current liabilities. The associated lease payments include both an interest component and payment of principal, with the underlying liability being extinguished at the end of the original lease term. As of December 31, 2024, we had a security deposit of $
5.9
 million related to this lease in the form of a cash collateralized letter of credit issued with UBS Bank USA, which is classified as long-term restricted cash on our balance sheet at December 31, 2024.
​
Note 12. Employee Benefit Plans
​
(a)          Defined Contribution Plan
​
We maintain the Axcelis Long-Term Investment Plan, a defined contribution plan. Eligible employees may contribute up to 
35
% of their compensation on a before-tax basis subject to Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) limitations. Highly compensated employees may contribute up to 
16
% of their compensation on a before-tax basis subject to IRS limitations. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we provided an employer match of 
50
% of employees’ pre-tax contributions on the first 
6
% of eligible compensation. Total related matching contribution expense was $
3.4
 million, $
3.4
 million and $
2.7
 million, for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
​
(b)          Other Compensation Plans
​
We operate in foreign jurisdictions that require lump sum benefits, payable based on statutory regulations, for voluntary or involuntary termination. Where required, an annual actuarial valuation of the benefit plans is obtained.
​
We have recorded an unfunded liability of $
3.1
 million and $
3.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for costs associated with these compensation plans in foreign jurisdictions. The following table presents the classification of these liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

​
Note 13. Stock Award Plans and Stock-Based Compensation
​
(a)          Equity Incentive Plans
​
We maintain the Axcelis Technologies, Inc. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2012 Equity Plan” or the “Plan”), which became effective on May 2, 2012.
​
The 2012 Equity Plan, as amended, reserves 
9.5
 million shares of common stock, $
0.001
 par value, for grant and permits the issuance of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock equivalents and awards of shares of common stock that are not subject to restrictions or forfeiture to selected employees, directors, and consultants of the Company.  The total number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan is the sum of 
7.76
 million shares approved by the shareholders, and 
1.78
 million shares added in accordance with the terms of the Plan as a result of 
60

Table of Contents
the expiration or forfeiture of awards granted under our prior equity plan. Shares that are not issued under an award (because such award expires, is terminated unexercised or is forfeited) revert back to the Plan.
​
The term of stock options granted under the Plan is specified in the award agreements. Unless a lesser term is otherwise specified by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, option awards under the 2012 Equity Plan will expire 
seven years
 from the date of grant. Under the terms of the Plan, the exercise price of a stock option may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Under the 2012 Equity Plan, fair market value is defined as the last reported sale price of a share of the Company’s common stock on a national securities exchange as of any applicable date, as long as the Company’s shares are traded on such exchange.
​
Stock options granted to employees generally vest over a period of 
four years
, while stock options granted to non-employee members of the Company’s Board of Directors generally vest over a period of 
six months
 and, once vested, are not affected by the director’s termination of service to the Company. In limited circumstances, the Company may grant stock option awards with market-based vesting conditions, such as the Company’s common stock price, or other performance conditions. Termination of service by an employee will cause options to cease vesting as of the date of termination, and in most cases, employees will have 
90 days
 after termination to exercise options that were vested as of the termination of employment. In general, retiring employees will have 
one year
 after termination of employment to exercise vested options. The Company settles stock option exercises with newly issued shares of common stock.
​
Restricted stock units granted to employees during 2024 had both service-based vesting provisions and performance-based vesting provisions. Restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest over a service period of 
four years
, while restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Company’s Board of Directors in 2024 vest over a service period of 
one year
. We have granted restricted stock units to executive officers and other senior employees with performance vesting conditions, which may be subject to further service-based vesting terms. Unvested restricted stock unit awards expire upon termination of service to the Company. We settle restricted stock units upon vesting with newly issued shares of common stock. 
No
 restricted stock was granted during the three year period ended December 31, 2024. 
​
As of December 31, 2024, there were 
0.5
 million shares available for grant under the 2012 Equity Plan. 
​
As of December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 options outstanding and 
0.5
 million unvested restricted stock units outstanding under the 2012 Stock Plan.
​
(b)          Employee Stock Purchase Plan
​
The 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2020 ESPP”) provides our employees an opportunity to purchase common stock of the Company at less than market prices. Purchases are made through payroll deductions of up to 
10
% of the employee’s salary as elected by the participant, subject to certain caps set forth in the 2020 ESPP. Employees may purchase the Company’s common stock at 
85
% of its market price on the day the stock is purchased.
​
The 2020 ESPP is considered compensatory and as such, compensation expense has been recognized based on the benefit of the discounted stock price, amortized to compensation expense over each offering period of 
six months
. Compensation expense relating to the 2020 ESPP was approximately $
0.4
 million, $
0.4
 million, and $
0.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
​
As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 
0.9
 million shares reserved for issuance and available for purchase under the 2020 ESPP, with 
19,268
 shares purchased on that date to be issued pending settlement. 
0.1
 million shares were purchased under the 2020 ESPP for the year ended December 31, 2024. Less than 
0.1
 million shares were purchased under the 2020 ESPP for both of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
​
(c)          Valuation of Restricted Stock Units
​
The fair value of the Company’s restricted stock units is calculated based upon the fair market value of the Company’s stock at the date of grant.
61

Table of Contents
​
(d)          Summary of Stock-based Compensation Expense
​
We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize expense for stock-based awards such that the expense associated with awards is evenly recognized throughout the period.
​
The amount of stock-based compensation recognized is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise them, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock-based award. Based on a historical analysis, a forfeiture rate of 
5
% per year was applied to stock-based awards, including executive officer awards, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
​
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $
21.0
 million, $
18.3
 million and $
13.4
 million, respectively. We present the expenses related to stock-based compensation in the same expense line items as cash compensation paid to our employees. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we used restricted stock units in our annual equity compensation program. 
​
The benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost is reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows as part of cash flows from operating activities. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost had no material impact.
​
(e)        Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock
​
Restricted stock units represent the Company’s unfunded and unsecured promise to issue shares of the common stock at a future date, subject to the terms of the Award Agreement issued under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan. Restricted stock unit awards granted in 2024 included time vested share awards and awards with performance vesting conditions. Restricted stock awards are issued shares of common stock that are subject to forfeiture on terms described in the Award Agreement, and may be granted under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan. 
No
 restricted stock awards were granted, or vested, during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The fair value of a restricted stock unit and restricted stock award is charged to expense ratably over the applicable service period. The purpose of these awards is to assist in attracting and retaining highly competent employees and directors and to act as an incentive in motivating selected employees and directors to achieve long-term corporate objectives.

Changes in the Company’s non-vested restricted stock units for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows:

 and $

, respectively. Most restricted stock units provide for net share settlement to cover the employee’s personal income tax withholding obligations on vesting of the employee’s restricted stock units. Vesting activity above reflects shares vested before net share settlement. As of December 31, 2024, there was $
37.0
 million of total forfeiture-adjusted unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock units granted under the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
2.6
 years.

Note 14. Stockholders’ Equity
​
We may issue up to 
75
 million shares of common stock without additional shareholder approval. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
32.4
 million and 
32.7
 million outstanding shares of common stock, respectively. 
​
Note 15. Fair Value Measurements
​
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
​
(a)          Fair Value Hierarchy
​
The accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
​
Level 1
—applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
​
Level 2
—applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
​
Level 3
—applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
​
(b)          Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
​
Our money market funds and short-term investments with maturities of 90 days or less at time of purchase are included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets. Short-term investments with maturities greater than 90 days but not greater than 365 days are included in short-term investments in the consolidated balance sheets. 
​
The following table sets forth Company’s assets which are measured at fair value by level within the fair value hierarchy.

(c)          Other Financial Instruments
​
The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.
​
Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies
​
In addition to the finance and operating leases discussed in Note 9, we have purchase commitments and other contingency considerations.
​
(a)          Purchase Commitments
​
We have contracts and purchase orders for inventory and other expenditures of $
187.5
 million at December 31, 2024, approximately $
178.6
 million of which are expected to occur in 2025.
​
(b)          Litigation
​
We are not presently a party to any litigation that we believe might have a material adverse effect on our business operations. We are, from time to time, a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations.
​
(c)          Indemnifications
​
Our system sales agreements typically include provisions under which we agree to take certain actions, provide certain remedies and defend our customers against third-party claims of intellectual property infringement under specified conditions and to indemnify customers against any damage and costs awarded in connection with such claims. We have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
​
Note 17. Business Segment and Geographic Region Information
​
We operate in 
one
 business segment, which is the manufacture of capital equipment for the semiconductor chip manufacturing industry. The principal market for semiconductor capital equipment is semiconductor chip manufacturers. Substantially all sales are made directly by us to our customers located in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific.
​
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is our chief executive officer. The CODM assesses financial performance for the company and decides how to allocate resources based on consolidated net income, such as determining the amount of resources to allocate to research and development projects, stock repurchases, or other growth opportunities. Segment asset information is provided to the CODM but it is not used to allocate resources.

Changes in tax rates and tax laws are accounted for in the period of enactment. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when these temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. 
At December 31, 2024, we maintained a $
14.7
 million valuation allowance in the U.S. against certain tax credits and state net operating losses due to the uncertainty of their realization based on long-term Company forecasts and the expiration dates on these attributes. This represents an increase of $
3.8
 million from the prior year. 
At December 31, 2024, we had research and development and other tax credit carryforwards of $
17.4
 million. These carry forwards are subject to an uncertain tax position reserve of $
6.0
 million. These credits can be used to reduce future federal and state income tax liabilities and expire principally between 2025 and 2036.
​
We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon. As of December 31, 2024, there is 
no
 cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. We did not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business.
We and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions. We and most foreign subsidiaries are subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for all years dating back to 2021. Our policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as operating expenses. We believe that we have appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on our tax returns and that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter.
At December 31, 2024, we had unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $
12.5
 million, $
9.0
 million of which is recorded as a long-term liability, and the remainder of which reduced the Company’s state deferred tax 
68

assets and the offsetting valuation allowance. We recognized $
0.7
 million in interest and penalty expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 relating to these uncertain tax positions. These unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate and also reverse associated accrued interest and penalty expenses.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows:
