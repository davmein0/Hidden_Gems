ITEM 6. [RESERVED]
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Our non-GAAP financial measures should only be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these measures help investors understand our core operating results and prospects, which is consistent with how management measures and forecasts our performance without the effect of often one-time charges and other items outside our normal operations. Management uses these measures to assess the performance of the company's operations and establish operational goals and incentives. They are not a substitute for financial measures prepared under U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures is located with each non-GAAP measure.

The increase in Pega Cloud revenue in 2024 was primarily due to expanded adoption of Pega Cloud by our existing clients. 
•
The decrease in maintenance revenue in 2024 was primarily due to our clients’ shift to Pega Cloud-based offerings, which do not generally result in maintenance revenue.
•
The decrease in subscription license revenue in 2024 was primarily due to our clients’ shift to Pega Cloud-based offerings, and several large multi-year subscription license contracts recognized in revenue in 2023.
•
The decrease in perpetual license revenue in 2024 reflects our strategy of promoting subscription-based arrangements.
•
The decrease in consulting revenue in 2024 was primarily due to decreases in consultant billable hours.

 The gross profit change in 2024 was primarily due to a shift in the revenue mix. Also contributing to the change was:
•
The increase in Pega Cloud gross profit percent in 2024 was primarily due to increased cost efficiency, primarily for hosting services and employee compensation and benefits, as Pega Cloud continues to grow and scale.
•
The decrease in consulting gross profit percent in 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in utilization rates.

The decrease in selling and marketing in 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits of $27.8 million due to reduced headcount from the optimization of our go-to-market strategy. For additional information, see "Note 12. Restructuring" in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
•
The increase in general and administrative in 2024 was primarily due to an increase of $10.7 million in compensation and benefits including $4.8 million of stock based compensation expense associated with performance stock options granted in 2023 (see "Note 16. Stock-Based Compensation"
) 
and an increase of $4.8 million in legal fees and related expenses arising from legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business. We expect to continue to incur additional costs for these proceedings. For additional information, see "Note 20. Commitments And Contingencies" in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

The restructuring in 2024 and 2023 was primarily due to our efforts to optimize our go-to-market organization and office space. For additional information, see "Note 12. Restructuring" in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

The change in foreign currency transaction (loss) gain in 2024 was primarily due to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with foreign currency-denominated cash and receivables held by our subsidiary in the United Kingdom.
•
The increase in interest income in 2024 was primarily due to higher investment balances and higher interest rate yields.
•
The change in (loss) on capped call transactions in 2024 was due to fair value adjustments for our capped call transactions.
•
The decrease in other income, net in 2024, was due to a reduction of $7.4 million in the gain from repurchases of our convertible senior notes and a reduction of $10 million in the gain in the value of equity securities held in our venture investments portfolio.

The effective income tax rate in 2024 was primarily driven by the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets and tax expense in the U.S. and U.K., partially offset by available tax attributes. 
On December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. The EU effective dates were January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. The impact of the Pillar Two Framework on the Company’s income tax provision in 2024 was not material. The Company is continuing to evaluate the potential impact of the Pillar Two Framework on future periods, pending legislative adoption by additional individual countries.

We believe that our current cash, marketable securities, cash flow provided by operations, borrowing capacity, and ability to engage in capital market transactions will be sufficient to fund our operations, settlement of our convertible senior notes due on March 1, 2025, stock repurchases, and quarterly cash dividends for at least the next 12 months and to meet our known long-term cash requirements. Whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our future growth, operating results, and the investments needed to support our operations. We may utilize available funds or seek external financing if we require additional capital resources.
If it becomes necessary or desirable to repatriate foreign funds, we may have to pay federal, state, and local income taxes as well as foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation. However, estimating the taxes we would have to pay is impracticable due to the complexity of income tax laws and regulations. For additional information, see risk factor "If it becomes necessary or desirable to repatriate our foreign cash balances to the United States, we may be subject to increased taxes, other restrictions, and limitations" in Item 1A of this Annual Report.
Operating activities
The change in cash provided by operating activities in 2024 was primarily due to growth in client collections and the impact of our cost-efficiency initiatives. For additional information, see "Note 12. Restructuring" in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We expect to continue to incur legal fees and related costs arising from proceedings outside the ordinary course of business. For additional information, see "Note 20. Commitments And Contingencies" in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Investing activities
The change in cash (used in) investing activities in 2024 was primarily due to our increased investments in financial instruments and reduced investment in property and equipment as we optimized our office space.

Financing activities
Debt financing
In February 2020, we
 issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, which mature on March 1, 2025. In 2024, we paid $33.9 million to repurchase $34.4 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes. As of December 31, 2024, we had $468 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes outstanding due on March 1, 2025. For additional information, see "Note 11. Debt" in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
In November 2019, and as since amended, we entered into a five-year $100 million senior secured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) with PNC Bank, National Association. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $27.3 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility, reducing available borrowing capacity, but no outstanding cash borrowings. For additional information, see "Note 11. Debt" in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

A detailed discussion and analysis of the 2023 year-over-year changes can be found in "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS
Management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared following accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for annual financial reporting. Preparing these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and beliefs about what could occur in the future, given the available information. 
We believe that of our significant accounting policies, described in “Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8 of this Annual Report, the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and require the most subjective judgment. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. If actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements.
Revenue recognition
Our client contracts typically contain promises by us to provide multiple products and services. Specifically, contracts associated with Pega Platform sales and other software applications, sold as licenses to use functional intellectual property or as a cloud-based solution, typically include consulting services. Determining whether such products and services within a client contract are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires significant judgment. Accordingly, we review client contracts to identify all separate promises to transfer goods and services that would be considered performance obligations. Judgment is also required in determining whether an option to acquire additional products and services within a client contract represents a material right that the client would not receive without entering into that contract.
A contract modification is a legally binding change to an existing contract’s scope, price, or both. Contract modifications are reviewed to determine whether they should be accounted for as part of the original contract or as a separate contract. This determination requires significant judgment, which could impact the timing of revenue recognition. We typically account for contract modifications prospectively as a separate contract. The additional performance obligation(s) in our contract modifications are generally distinct and priced at their stand-alone selling price.
We allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations, including options in contracts determined to represent a material right, based on each performance obligation's relative stand-alone selling price. Judgment is required in estimating stand-alone selling prices. We maximize the use of observable inputs by maintaining pricing analyses that consider our pricing policies, historical stand-alone sales when they exist, and historical renewal prices charged to clients. We have concluded that the stand-alone selling prices of certain performance obligations, specifically software licenses and Pega Cloud arrangements, are highly variable. In these instances, we estimate the stand-alone selling prices using the residual approach, which is determined based on the total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract. We update our stand-alone selling price analysis periodically, including a re-assessment of whether the residual approach used to determine the stand-alone selling prices for software licenses and Pega Cloud arrangements remains appropriate.
Changes in the assumptions or judgments used in determining the performance obligations in client contracts and stand-alone selling prices could significantly impact the timing and amount of revenue we report in a particular period.

Goodwill impairment
Our goodwill arises from our previous business acquisitions. 
•
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or as circumstances indicate its value may no longer be recoverable.
•
We do not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill. 
•
We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30th. To assess if goodwill is impaired, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If, based on the qualitative assessment, we consider it more-likely-than-not that our reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative impairment test. An excess of carrying value over fair value would indicate that goodwill may be impaired. 
•
We periodically reevaluate our business and have determined that we have one operating segment and one reporting unit. If our assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce our goodwill's carrying value. Changes in the valuation of goodwill could materially impact our operating results and financial position.
32
As of December 31, 2024, we had $81.1 million of goodwill. Changes in the valuation of long-lived assets could materially impact our operating results and financial position. To date, there have been no impairments of goodwill.
For additional information see "Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies" and "Note 7. Goodwill And Other Intangible Assets" in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Accounting for income taxes
Significant judgment is required to determine our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in applying accounting principles and complex tax laws. Accordingly, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact our financial statements.
We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. The future realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on sufficient taxable income within the available carryback or carryforward periods. Changes in our valuation allowance impact income tax expense in the period of adjustment. Our deferred tax valuation allowance requires significant judgment and uncertainties, including assumptions about future taxable income based on historical and projected information. 
We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe they are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available objective and verifiable negative and positive evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income (including the impact of enacted legislation), tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. The Company determined that the objectively and verifiable negative evidence outweighed the positive evidence, as such maintained a valuation allowance on our U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets.
We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits based on management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements.
As a global company, we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In the ordinary course of our business, transactions and calculations occur whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain. Some of these uncertainties arise due to transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries, the determination of tax nexus, and tax credit estimates. In addition, the calculation of acquired tax attributes and the associated limitations are complex. We estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and the probability of such outcomes. 
Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, there is no guarantee that the final tax outcome will not differ from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, returns, and accruals. Such differences, or changes in estimates relating to potential differences, could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period such a determination is made.
For additional information see "Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies" and "Note 18. Income Taxes" in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Loss Contingencies
We are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations, and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is common for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a material loss is reasonably possible or probable, but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Legal fees are recognized as incurred when the legal services are provided.
We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made. 
See "Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies" and "Note 20. Commitments And Contingencies" in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in financial market prices and rates.
Foreign currency exposure
Translation risk
Our international operations’ operating expenses are primarily denominated in foreign currencies. However, our international sales are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies, partially offsetting our foreign currency exposure.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Pegasystems Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pegasystems Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) i
ssued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO. 
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on and changes in internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition - Software License Arrangements — Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company generates revenue from multiple sources, including software license revenue primarily derived from license sales of the Company’s Pega Platform and other software applications, maintenance revenue from client support, and services revenue primarily derived from cloud sales of the Company’s hosted Pega Platform and other software applications and consulting services. 
The Company’s license and cloud contracts with clients (“arrangements”) often contain multiple performance obligations. These performance obligations may be included in the same contract or negotiated separately. Additionally, the Company enters into amendments to previously executed contracts which constitute contract modifications. Certain complex arrangements require that management performs a detailed analysis of the contractual terms and the application of more complex accounting guidance. Factors with potentially significant judgements include:
•
Identification of the complete client arrangement
•
Accounting treatment of contract modifications
•
Valuation and allocation of identified material rights
•
Allocation of arrangement consideration to bundled fixed price work orders
Given the accounting complexity and the management judgment necessary to properly identify, classify, and account for performance obligations, auditing such estimates involved a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the license and cloud revenue arrangements.
36
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to license and cloud revenue arrangements included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over revenue recognition, including those over the identification of performance obligations included in the transaction, accounting treatment of contract modifications, valuation and allocation of identified material rights, and allocation of arrangement consideration. 
•
We selected a sample of client arrangements, and performed the following: 
◦
Evaluated whether the Company properly identified the terms of the arrangements and considered all arrangement terms that may have an impact on revenue recognition.
◦
Evaluated whether the Company appropriately identified all performance obligations in the arrangement and whether the methodology to allocate the transaction price to the individual performance obligations was appropriately applied.
◦
Tested the accuracy of management’s calculation of revenue for each performance obligation by developing an expectation for the revenue to be recorded in the current period and comparing it to the Company’s recorded balances.
◦
Evaluated management’s assessment of any ongoing negotiations with clients and bundling with statements of work.
◦
Analyzed the proper accounting treatment for any contract modifications based on 1) whether the additional products and services are distinct from the products and services in the original arrangement, and 2) whether the amount of consideration expected for the added products and services reflects the stand-alone selling price of those products and services.
◦
Evaluated management’s determination of whether certain renewal clauses, additional product offers, or additional usage offers represent material rights included in the contract and whether they were properly valued based on the incremental discount provided and the probability of the right being exercised.
◦
For contracts with a performance obligation of bundled fixed price services, evaluated whether management reasonably estimated the number of hours that each project will require and independently recalculated the stand-alone selling price for each bundled fixed price service.
◦
Obtained evidence of delivery of the elements of the arrangement to the client.

PEGASYSTEMS INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Business
The Company develops, markets, licenses, hosts, and supports enterprise software that helps organizations optimize decisions and processes in real-time. The Company’s platform for enterprise artificial intelligence (“AI”) decisioning and workflow automation enables clients to personalize customer experiences, automate customer service, and streamline operations, business processes, and workflows. The Company provides consulting, training, support, and hosting services to facilitate the use of its software.
Management estimates and reporting
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Accounts with reported amounts based on significant estimates and judgments include, but are not limited to, revenue, unbilled receivables, deferred revenue, deferred income taxes, deferred commissions, income taxes payable, convertible senior notes, and goodwill.
Principles of consolidation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements reflect Pegasystems Inc. and subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling financial interest. All intercompany accounts and transactions were eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, income (loss) from operations, or net income (loss).
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenue
The Company’s revenue is primarily derived from:
•
Subscription services, composed of revenue from Pega Cloud and maintenance. Pega Cloud is the Company’s hosted Pega Platform and software applications. Maintenance revenue is earned from providing client support, software upgrades, and bug fixes or patches.
•
Subscription license, composed of revenue from term license arrangements for the Company’s Pega Platform and software applications. Term licenses represent functional intellectual property and are delivered separately from maintenance and services. 
•
Perpetual license, composed of revenue from perpetual license arrangements for the Company’s Pega Platform and software applications. Perpetual licenses represent functional intellectual property and are delivered separately from maintenance and services. 
•
Consulting, primarily related to new software license implementations, training, and reimbursable costs.
Performance obligations
The Company’s software license and Pega Cloud arrangements often contain multiple performance obligations. If a contract contains multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for each distinct performance obligation separately. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. Any discounts or expected potential future price concessions are considered when determining the total transaction price. The Company’s policy is to exclude sales and similar taxes collected from clients from the determination of transaction price.

Consulting
(1) Technical support and software updates are considered distinct services but accounted for as a single performance obligation, as they have the same pattern of transfer to the client.
The Company utilizes the residual approach for software license and Pega Cloud performance obligations since the selling price is highly variable and the stand-alone selling price is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. Periodically, the Company reevaluates whether the residual approach remains appropriate. As required, the Company evaluates its residual approach estimate compared to all available observable data before concluding the estimate represents its stand-alone selling price.
If the contract grants the client the option to acquire additional products or services, the Company assesses whether the option represents a material right to the client that the client would not receive without entering into that contract. Discounts on options to purchase additional products and services greater than discounts available to similar clients are accounted for as an additional performance obligation.
During most of each client contract term, the amount invoiced is generally less than the amount of revenue recognized to date, primarily because we transfer control of the performance obligation related to the software license at the inception of the contract term. A significant portion of the total contract consideration is typically allocated to the license performance obligation. Therefore, the Company’s contracts often result in the recording of unbilled receivables and contract assets throughout most of the contract term. The Company records an unbilled receivable or contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings. The Company recognizes an impairment on receivables and contract assets if, after contract inception, it becomes probable that payment is not collectible. The Company reviews receivables and contract assets on an individual basis for impairment.
Variable consideration
The Company’s arrangements can include variable fees, such as the option to purchase additional usage of a previously delivered software license. The Company may also provide pricing concessions to clients, a business practice that gives rise to variable fees. For variable fees arising from the client’s acquisition of additional usage of a previously delivered software license, the Company applies the sales and usage-based royalties guidance related to a license of intellectual property and recognizes the revenue in the period the underlying sale or usage occurs. The Company includes variable fees in the determination of total transaction price if it is not probable that a significant future reversal of revenue will occur. The Company uses the expected value or most likely value amount, whichever is more appropriate for specific circumstances, to estimate variable consideration, and the estimates are based on the level of historical price concessions offered to clients. The variable consideration related to pricing concessions and other forms of variable consideration, including usage-based fees, have not been material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Significant financing components
The Company generally does not intend to provide financing to its clients, as financing arrangements are not contemplated as part of the negotiated terms of contracts between the Company and its clients. Although there may be an intervening period between the delivery of the license and the payment, typically in term license arrangements, the purpose of that timing difference is to align the client’s payment with the timing of the use of the software license or service.
In certain circumstances, however, there are instances where revenue recognition timing differs from the timing of payment due to extended payment terms or fees that are non-proportional to the associated usage of software licenses. In these instances, the Company evaluates whether a significant financing component exists. This evaluation includes determining the difference between the consideration the client would have paid when the performance obligation was satisfied and the amount of consideration paid. Contracts that include a significant financing component are adjusted for the time value of money at the rate inherent in the contract, the client’s borrowing rate, or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, depending upon the recipient of the financing. 
During 2024, 2023, and 2022, significant financing components were not material.
45
Contract modifications
The Company assesses contract modifications to determine:
•
if the additional products and services are distinct from the products and services in the original arrangement; and
•
if the amount of consideration expected for the added products and services reflects the stand-alone selling price of those products and services.
A contract modification meeting both criteria is accounted for as a separate contract. If a contract modification does not meet both criteria, it is accounted for either:
•
on a prospective basis as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract; or
•
on a cumulative catch-up basis.
Deferred commissions
The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a client contract, primarily related to sales commissions. The Company expects to benefit from those costs for more than one year. Commissions earned upon the execution of initial contracts are allocated to each performance obligation within the contract and amortized according to the transfer of underlying goods and services within those contracts and expected renewals. The expected benefit period is determined based on the length of the client contracts, client attrition rates, the underlying technology lifecycle, and the competitive marketplace’s influence on the products and services sold. Deferred costs allocated to maintenance and deferred costs for Pega Cloud arrangements are amortized over an average expected benefit period of 
4.5
 years. Deferred costs allocated to software licenses, and any expected renewals of term software licenses within the 
4.5
 years expected benefit period, are amortized at the point in time control of the software license is transferred. Deferred costs allocated to consulting are amortized over a period consistent with the pattern of transfer of control for the related services. Commissions earned on contract amendments and renewals are allocated to each performance obligation within the contract and amortized over the contractual term.
Financial instruments
The principal financial instruments held by the Company consist of cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, capped call transactions, and accounts payable. The Company considers debt securities readily convertible to known amounts of cash with maturities of three months or less from the purchase date to be cash equivalents. Interest is recorded when earned. The Company’s investments are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses considered temporary are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss), net of related income taxes. The Company reviews all investments for reductions in fair value that are other-than-temporary. When such reductions occur, the investment cost is adjusted to fair value by recording a loss on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses on investments are calculated based on the specific investment.
For additional information see "Note 4. Receivables, Contract Assets, And Deferred Revenue", "Note 11. Debt", and "Note 13. Fair Value Measurements".
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, which are 
three years
 for computer equipment and 
five years
 for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease’s term or the useful life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
All of the Company’s leases are operating leases, primarily composed of office space leases. The Company accounts for a contract as a lease when it has the right to control the asset for a period of time while obtaining substantially all of the asset’s economic benefits. The Company determines the initial classification and measurement of its operating right of use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter if modified. Fixed lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease costs include payments required under leases for common area maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities, service charges, and other variable costs that are not reflected in the measurement of right of use assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company combines lease and non-lease components when determining lease costs for its office space leases. The lease liability includes lease payments related to options to extend or renew the lease term if the Company is reasonably certain it will exercise those options. The Company’s leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.
Loss contingencies and legal costs
The Company accrues loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. 
46
Significant judgments are required to determine the probability and the range of the outcomes, and the estimates are based only on the information available to the Company at the time. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in claims, legal proceedings, and in estimating the losses that may arise, actual outcomes may differ from the Company’s estimates. Contingencies deemed not probable, or for which losses were not estimable in one period, may become probable or losses may become estimable in later periods, which may have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability from pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates. Regardless of the outcome, legal disputes can have a material effect on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. Legal costs are expensed as incurred.

Internal-use software 
The Company capitalizes and amortizes certain direct costs associated with computer software developed or purchased for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. The Company amortizes capitalized internal-use software on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally over 
three
 to 
five years
, commencing on the date the software is placed into service.

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the residual purchase price paid in a business combination after the fair value of all identified assets and liabilities have been recorded. Goodwill is not amortized. The Company has a single reporting unit.
 The Company performed qualitative assessments as of November 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and concluded that there was no impairment since it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of its reporting unit was less than its carrying value. 
Intangible and long-lived assets
The Company’s intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life. The Company evaluates its long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets’ carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is assessed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived tangible or intangible assets to their carrying value. If impairment exists, the Company calculates the impairment by comparing the carrying value to its fair value as determined by discounted expected cash flows.
Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents include money market funds and other investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Restricted cash
The Company records restricted cash amounts as a current asset on the consolidated balance sheets if the restriction expires in less than 12 months, or as a non-current asset if the restriction is greater than 12 months. If there is no minimum time frame during which the cash must remain restricted, the nature of the transactions related to the restriction determine the classification. Restricted cash primarily relates to amounts deposited to secure customer guarantees and various letters of credit.
Business combinations
The Company uses its estimates and assumptions to assign a fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly as new information arises and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.
Research and development and software development costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalization of computer software developed for resale begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility, generally demonstrated by a working model or an operative version of the computer software product. Such costs have not been material to date, as technological feasibility is established within a short time frame from the software’s general availability.
 As a result, 
no
 costs were capitalized in 2024, 2023, or 2022.
47
Stock-based compensation
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense associated with equity awards based on the award’s fair value at the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures. For service-based awards, stock-based compensation is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the longer of (a) the implicit service period for performance-metric achievement or (b) the requisite service period. During each reporting period, stock-based compensation expense is recorded based on expected achievement of performance targets. Changes in estimates of the expected achievement of performance targets that result in a change in the number of shares that are expected to vest are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis during the reporting period in which the estimate changed.
 See "Note 16. Stock-Based Compensation" for a discussion of the Company’s key assumptions when determining the fair value of its equity awards at the grant date.
Foreign currency translation and remeasurement
The translation of assets and liabilities for the Company’s subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are made at period-end exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates during the period transactions occur. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive (loss). Realized and unrealized exchange gains or losses from transactions and remeasurement adjustments are reflected in foreign currency transaction gain (loss) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Accounting for income taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. Future realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets ultimately depends on sufficient taxable income within the available carryback or carryforward periods. Taxable income sources include taxable income in prior carryback years, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance impact income tax expense in the period of adjustment. The Company recognizes excess tax benefits when realized, as a reduction of the provision for income taxes. 
The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits based on management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company records the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. The Company classifies liabilities for uncertain tax positions as non-current liabilities unless the uncertainty is expected to be resolved within one year. The Company classifies interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.
As a global company, significant judgment must be used to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates. In the ordinary course of the Company’s business, there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain. Some of these uncertainties arise because of transfer pricing for transactions with the Company’s subsidiaries and nexus and tax credit estimates. In addition, the calculation of acquired tax attributes and the associated limitations are complex.
For additional information, see "Note 18. Income Taxes".
Advertising expense
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
 Advertising expenses were $
4.7
 million, $
3.5
 million, and $
6.6
 million during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Newly adopted accounting pronouncements
Segment reporting
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,
 Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
(“ASU 2023-07”). The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are effective for all public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. ASU 2023-07 did not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. Under ASU 2023-07, public entities with a single reportable segment must apply all of the ASU’s disclosure requirements and the existing segment disclosure and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 - Segment Reporting on an annual and interim basis. The Company implemented this ASU in 2024 and its impact was immaterial.
Accounting pronouncements not yet effective
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
48
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09
, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
(“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 includes expanded income tax rate reconciliation disclosures, a disaggregation of income taxes paid, and other expanded disclosures. The ASU will be effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2025. The Company expects the adoption to result in disclosure changes only.
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03
, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses 
(ASU “2024-03”). Among other items, the requirements include expanded disclosures around employee compensation and selling expenses. ASU 2024-03 will be effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2027. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements but expect the adoption to result in disclosure changes only.

9. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.
The Company derives substantially all of its revenue from the sale and support of one group of similar products and services – software that provides case management, business process management, and real-time decisioning solutions to improve customer engagement and operational excellence in the enterprise applications market. To assess performance, the Company’s CODM, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information on a consolidated basis. Therefore, the Company determined it has 
one
 operating segment and 
one
 reportable segment. The accounting policies of the Company’s operating segment are the same as those described in "Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies". The CODM uses consolidated net income (loss) to set financial performance targets, assess performance, and make expense allocation decisions.

10. LEASES
The Company leased office space beginning in March 2021 at One Main Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts to serve as its corporate headquarters (the “Cambridge office”). The 
4.5
 year lease includes a base rent of $
2
 million per year. In December 2024, the Company closed the Cambridge office and relocated its corporate headquarters to office space already leased in Waltham, Massachusetts (the “Waltham office”), effective January 1, 2025. The Company recorded a restructuring expense of $
3.7
 million as a result of closing the Cambridge office.
The Waltham office is 
131
 thousand square feet of leased office space located at 225 Wyman Street, Waltham, Massachusetts. The lease term of 
11
 years began on August 1, 2021, with no rent due until August 1, 2022. The annual rent equals the base rent of approximately $
6
 million, with 
3
% annual increases, plus a portion of building operating costs and real estate taxes. In addition, the Company received an improvement allowance from the landlord of $
11.8
 million.

11. DEBT
Convertible senior notes and capped calls
Convertible senior notes
In February 2020, the Company issued convertible senior notes (the "Notes") with an aggregate principal of $
600
 million, due March 1, 2025, in a private placement. No principal payments are due before maturity. The Notes accrue interest at an annual rate of 
0.75
%, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, beginning September 1, 2020.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized gains of $
0.5
 million and $
7.9
 million in other income, net from repurchases of Notes representing $
34.4
 million and $
97.7
 million in aggregate principal amount, respectively.
Conversion rights
The conversion rate is 7.4045 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, representing an initial conversion price of $
135.05
 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be adjusted upon certain events, including spin-offs, tender offers, exchange offers, and certain stockholder distributions. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election, based on the applicable conversion rate.
Beginning on September 1, 2024, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election. 
Before September 1, 2024, noteholders could convert their Notes in the following circumstances:
•
During any calendar quarter beginning after June 30, 2020 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price for each of at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.
•
During the 
five
 consecutive business days immediately after any 
five
 consecutive trading day period (the “Measurement Period”), if the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day.
•
Upon certain corporate events or distributions or if the Company calls any Notes for redemption, noteholders may convert before the close of business on the business day immediately before the related redemption date (or, if the Company fails to pay the redemption price in full on the redemption date until the Company pays the redemption price).
Repurchase rights
On or after March 1, 2023 and on or before the 
40
th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, the Company may redeem for cash all or part of the Notes at a repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock exceeded 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides a redemption notice.
If certain corporate events that constitute a “Fundamental Change” occur, each noteholder will have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all of such noteholder’s Notes, or any portion of the principal thereof that is equal to $1,000 or a multiple of $1,000, at a repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. A Fundamental Change relates to mergers, changes in control of the Company, liquidation/dissolution of the Company, or the delisting of the Company’s common stock.

Capped call transactions
In February 2020, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Call Transactions”) with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions initially covered approximately 
4.4
 million shares (representing the number of shares for which the Notes were initially convertible) of the Company’s common stock. In 2024, Capped Call Transactions covering approximately 
0.3
 million shares were settled for proceeds of $
0.01
 million. As of December 31, 2024, Capped Call Transactions covering approximately 
3.5
 million shares were outstanding.
The Capped Call Transactions are expected to reduce common stock dilution and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company must make, other than for principal and interest, upon conversion of the Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap of $
196.44
. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is subject to adjustment upon specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including mergers and tender offers.
The Capped Call Transactions are accounted for as derivative instruments and do not qualify for the Company’s own equity scope exception in ASC 815 since, in some cases of early settlement, the settlement value calculated following the governing documents may not represent a fair value measurement. The Capped Call Transactions are remeasured to fair value each reporting period, resulting in a non-operating gain or loss.

Credit facility
In November 2019, and as since amended, the Company entered into a 
five-year
 $
100
 million senior secured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) with PNC Bank, National Association.

The Company may use borrowings for general corporate purposes and to finance working capital needs. Subject to specific conditions and the agreement of the financial institutions lending the additional amount, the aggregate commitment may be increased to $
200
 million. The Credit Facility, as amended, contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, those relating to additional indebtedness, liens, asset divestitures, and affiliate transactions. Beginning with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company must maintain a maximum net consolidated leverage ratio of 
3.5
 to 1.0 (with a step-up for certain acquisitions) and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 
3.5
 to 1.0. Effective as of February 4, 2025, the Credit Facility was amended to extend the expiration date to February 4, 2027.
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $
27.3
 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility, reducing available borrowing capacity, but 
no
 outstanding cash borrowings.

13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
The Company records its cash equivalents, marketable securities, capped call transactions, and venture investments at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
As a basis for classifying the fair value measurements, a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which classifies the fair value measurements based on the inputs used in measuring fair value, was established as follows: 
•
Level 1 - observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
•
Level 2 - significant other inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 
•
Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs with little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions.
This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data when available and minimize unobservable inputs when determining fair value.
The fair value of the Capped Call Transactions at the end of each reporting period is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The valuation model uses various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield. The Company applies judgment when determining expected volatility. The Company considers the underlying equity security’s historical and implied volatility levels. The Company’s venture investments are recorded at fair value based on multiple valuation methods, including observable public companies and transaction prices and unobservable inputs, including the volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities the Company holds.

The carrying value of certain financial instruments, including receivables and accounts payable, approximates fair value due to their short maturities.
Fair value of the Notes
The fair value of the Notes outstanding (including the embedded conversion feature) was $
463.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and $
466.5
 million as of December 31, 2023. 
The fair value was determined based on the Notes’ quoted price in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Credit risk
In addition to receivables, the Company is potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk from the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the Company’s credit risk exposure. Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities.

Preferred stock
The Company has 
1
 million authorized shares of preferred stock, $

 were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2024. 
The Board of Directors has the authority to issue the shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series, and to determine the designation, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each series and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock could decrease the earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of common stock and may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or defeating a change in control of the Company.

The Company periodically grants employees stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and non-employee Directors common stock and stock options.
In 2022, most of the Company’s stock based compensation arrangements vest over 
five years
, with 
20
% vesting after 
one year
 and the remaining 
80
% vesting quarterly over the remaining 
four years
. Beginning in 2023, most of the Company’s stock based compensation arrangements vest over 
four years
, with 
25
% vesting after one year and the remaining 
75
% vesting quarterly over the remaining 
three years
. The Company’s stock options have a term of 
ten years
. In 2024, the Company also granted 
0.6
 million performance stock options with a total grant date fair value of $
13.9
 million, which vest over 
2
 years based on the Company’s achievement of certain financial performance targets.
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation using the accelerated attribution method, treating each vesting tranche as an individual grant. The stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Ultimately, the Company recognizes the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest. 
Employees may elect to receive 
50
% of the employee’s target incentive compensation under the Company’s Corporate Incentive Compensation Plan (the “CICP”) in the form of RSUs instead of cash. If elected by an employee, the equity amount is equal in value on the grant date to 
50
% of the employee’s target incentive opportunity, based on the employee’s base salary. The number of RSUs granted is determined by dividing 
50
% of the employee’s target incentive opportunity by 
85
% of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date, less the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period. If elected, the award vests 
100
% on the following year’s CICP payout date. Vesting is conditioned upon the performance conditions of the CICP and on continued employment; if threshold funding does not occur, the RSUs will not vest. The Company considers vesting probable on the grant date and recognizes the associated stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period beginning on the grant date and ending on the vesting date.
59
Historically, the Company has granted awards that allow for the settlement of vested stock options and RSUs on a net share basis (“net settled awards”). With net settled awards, the Company withholds shares to cover the exercise price (for stock options) and the minimum statutory tax withholding obligations (for stock options and RSUs) from the shares that would otherwise be issued upon exercise or settlement. In 2023, the Company moved to cashless settlement for most of its awards. Under cashless settlement, shares are automatically sold in the market at exercise (for stock options) or vest (for RSUs) to cover the exercise price (for stock options) and the minimum statutory tax withholding obligations (for stock options and RSUs).
Stock-based compensation plans
2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended and restated)
In 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the “2004 Plan”) to provide employees, non-employee Directors, and consultants with opportunities to purchase stock through incentive and non-qualified stock options. Subsequent amendments to the plan increased the number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan to 
42
 million, extended the term of the plan to 2030, and limited annual compensation to any non-employee Director to $
0.5
 million.
As of December 31, 2024, 
17.0
 million shares were subject to outstanding options and stock-based awards under the 2004 Plan. 
2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 2006, the Company adopted the 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2006 ESPP”) under which employees may purchase common stock, at a price equal to at least 
85
% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the lesser of the commencement date or completion date for offerings under the plan, or such higher price as the Company’s Board of Directors may establish from time to time. In October 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors amended the 2006 ESPP to continue until no shares remain. In 2023, the number of shares authorized for purchase under the 2006 ESPP was increased to 
2
 million. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors set the purchase price at 
85
% of the fair market value on the completion date of the offering period.

In 2024, the Company issued 
3.0
 million shares to its employees and directors under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.
As of December 31, 2024, there were 
3.9
 million shares available for issuance for future equity grants under the Company’s stock plans, consisting of 
3.0
 million shares under the 2004 Plan and 
0.9
 million shares under the 2006 ESPP.
Grant activity
Stock options
The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Key inputs used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, expected term of the option, expected volatility of the Company’s common stock over the option’s expected term, risk-free interest rate over the option’s expected term, and the Company’s expected annual dividend yield. The exercise price for stock options is equal to the shares’ fair market value at the grant date.

(2) The expected option term for each grant is determined based on the historical exercise behavior of employees and post-vesting employment termination behavior.
(3) The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury securities with a commensurate maturity with the expected option term at the time of grant.
(4) The expected annual dividend yield is based on the weighted-average dividend yield assumptions used for options granted during the applicable period.

Performance stock options
In 2023, the Company began awarding performance stock options. These performance stock options allow the holder to purchase a specified number of common stock shares at an exercise price equal to the shares' fair market value at the grant date. For the performance stock options granted in 2024, 
25
% can vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, and 
75
% can vest on the second anniversary of the grant date, based on the achievement of specific performance conditions for 2024 and 2025, respectively, including year over year growth in Annual Contract Value and Free Cash Flow Margin. The options expire 
ten years
 from the grant date.

RSUs
RSUs provide the recipient a right to receive a specified number of shares of the Company’s common stock upon vesting. The Company values its RSUs at the fair value of its common stock on the grant date, which is the closing price of its common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period, as the recipient is not entitled to dividends during the requisite service period. RSU grants include units issued when employees elect to receive 
50
% of the employee’s target incentive compensation under the Company’s Corporate Incentive Compensation Plan (the “CICP”) in the form of RSUs instead of cash.

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on sufficient taxable income within the available carryback or carryforward periods. The Company’s deferred tax valuation allowance requires significant judgment and has uncertainties, including assumptions about future taxable income based on historical and projected information
. 
In assessing the Company’s ability to realize its net deferred tax assets, the Company considered various factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial results to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based upon these factors, the Company has determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the need for a full valuation allowance against its net U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024. Accordingly, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of $
195.3
 million at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $
1.6
 million as a result of the operations of its entities throughout the year.
Given the Company’s recent earnings, the Company believes that there is a reasonable possibility that in a future period sufficient positive evidence may become available to allow the Company to reach a conclusion that a substantial portion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to significant judgement. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.
63
The Company had approximately $
5.4
 million and $
8.8
 million of post apportionment state net operating loss carryforwards, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The U.S. state losses expire at various times through 2044. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
10.4
 million of state tax credit carryforwards. 
The Company’s federal net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $
14.2
 million and $
20.6
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These federal carryforward losses and state credits expire between 2025 and 2039, except for $
1.2
 million of federal net operating losses and $
1
 million of state credits, which have an unlimited carryforward period.
The Company’s UK net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $
147.9
 million and $
183.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which have indefinite carryforward periods.

Tax examinations
The Company files federal and state income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service in the U.S. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2014 through 2019 were under examination by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions are auditing the Company’s income tax returns for periods ranging from 2018 through 2022. The Company does not expect the results of these audits to have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. With few exceptions, the statute of limitations remains open in all jurisdictions for all tax years since 2018.
19. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE

(1) All dilutive securities are excluded when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
(2) The shares underlying the conversion options in the Company’s Notes are included using the if-converted method, if dilutive in the period. If the outstanding conversion options were fully exercised, the Company would issue approximately 
3.5
 million shares as of December 31, 2024.

(3) The Company’s Capped Call Transactions represent the equivalent of approximately 
3.5
 million shares of the Company’s common stock (representing the number of shares for which the Notes are convertible) as of December 31, 2024. The Capped Call Transactions are expected to reduce common stock dilution and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company must make, other than for principal and interest, upon conversion of the Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap of $
196.44
. The Capped Call Transactions are excluded from weighted-average common shares outstanding, assuming dilution, in all periods as their effect would be anti-dilutive.
(4) Outstanding stock options and RSUs that were anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method in the period were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. These awards may be dilutive in the future.

Legal proceedings
In addition to the matters below, the Company is or may become involved in a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, and proceedings that arise from time to time relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of the Company’s business, including actions concerning contracts, intellectual property, employment, benefits, and securities matters. Regardless of the outcome, legal disputes can have a material effect on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 
In addition, as the Company is a party to ongoing litigation, it is at least reasonably possible that the Company’s estimates will change in the near term, and the effect may be material. The Company had 
no
 accrued losses for litigation for the below matters as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Appian Corp. v. Pegasystems Inc. & Youyong Zou
The Company is a defendant in litigation brought by Appian in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia (the “Court”) titled Appian Corp. v. Pegasystems Inc. & Youyong Zou, No. 2020-07216 (Fairfax Cty. Ct.). On May 9, 2022, the jury rendered its verdict finding that the Company had misappropriated one or more of Appian’s trade secrets, that the Company had violated the Virginia Computer Crimes Act, and that the trade secret misappropriation was willful and malicious. The jury awarded damages of $
2,036,860,045
 for trade secret misappropriation and $
1.00
 for violating the Virginia Computer Crimes Act. On September 15, 2022, the circuit court of Fairfax County entered judgment of $
2,060,479,287
, consisting of the damages previously awarded by the jury plus attorneys’ fees and costs, and stating that the judgment is subject to post-judgment interest at a rate of 
6.0
% per annum, from the date of the jury verdict (May 9, 2022) as to the amount of the jury verdict and from September 15, 2022 as to the amount of the award of attorneys’ fees and costs. On September 15, 2022, the Company filed a notice of appeal from the judgment. On September 29, 2022, the circuit court of Fairfax County approved a $
25,000,000
 letter of credit obtained by the Company to secure the judgment and entered an order suspending the judgment during the pendency of the Company’s appeal. A panel of the Court of Appeals of Virginia heard oral arguments on November 15, 2023, and issued a written opinion on July 30, 2024. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment on Appian’s Virginia Uniform Trade Secrets Act claim and ordered a new trial on that claim. Appian filed a petition for appeal with the Supreme Court of Virginia on August 29, 2024, and the Company filed a response to the petition on October 21, 2024. Under the Court’s rules, Appian is entitled to a 10-minute oral argument in support of its petition. The Supreme Court of Virginia has scheduled that argument for February 11, 2025. Although it is not possible to predict timing, the entirety of the appeals process could potentially take years to complete. The Company continues to believe that it did not misappropriate any alleged trade secrets and that its sales of the Company’s products at issue were not caused by, or the result of, any alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate possible damages because of, among other things, uncertainty as to the outcome of appellate proceedings and/or any potential new trial resulting from the appellate proceedings.
PS Lit Recovery, LLC v. Pegasystems Inc., Alan Trefler, and Kenneth Stillwell and Eminence Fund Long Master, Ltd., Eminence Fund Master, Ltd., Eminence Fund II Master, LP, Eminence Partners Long II, LP, Eminence Fund Leveraged Master, Ltd., Eminence Partners, L.P., Eminence Partners II, L.P. v. Pegasystems Inc., Alan Trefler, and Kenneth Stillwell
On December 4, 2024, the shareholders representing approximately 
3
% of the settlement class that opted out of the court approved settlement in the class action matter captioned City of Fort Lauderdale Police and Firefighters’ Retirement System, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Pegasystems Inc., Alan Trefler, and Kenneth Stillwell (Case 1:22-cv-00578-LMB-IDD) (the “Class Action”) filed 
two
 lawsuits against the Company, the Company’s chief executive officer, and the Company’s chief operating and financial officer in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The first is captioned Eminence Fund Long Master, Ltd., Eminence Fund Master, Ltd., Eminence Fund II Master, LP, Eminence Partners Long II, LP, Eminence Fund Leveraged Master, Ltd., Eminence Partners, L.P., and Eminence Partners II, L.P. v. Pegasystems Inc., Alan Trefler, and Kenneth Stillwell (Case 1:24-cv-12999-WGY); the second is captioned PS Lit Recovery, LLC v. Pegasystems Inc., Alan Trefler, and Kenneth Stillwell (Case 1:24-cv-11220-WGY). The complaints, which are substantially similar, generally allege, among other things, that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and that the individual defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case by allegedly making materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as allegedly failing to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects, which caused the Company’s securities to trade at artificially inflated prices. The complaints also assert claims for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation, and seek unspecified damages. The defendants’ motion to dismiss is due ten business days following the court’s entry of the parties’ stipulation coordinating the cases, which the parties filed in the court on February 4, 2025. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate possible damages or a range of possible damages in these matters given the stage of the lawsuits and there being no specified quantum of damages sought in the complaints.

In re Pegasystems Inc., Derivative Litigation
On November 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed against the members of the Company’s board of directors, the Company’s chief operating and financial officer and the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, captioned Mary Larkin, derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant Pegasystems Inc. v. Peter Gyenes, Richard Jones, Christopher Lafond, Dianne Ledingham, Sharon Rowlands, Alan Trefler, Larry Weber, and Kenneth Stillwell, defendants, and Pegasystems Inc., nominal defendant (Case 1:22-cv-11985). The complaint generally alleges the defendants sold shares of the Company while in possession of material nonpublic information relating to (i) the litigation brought by Appian in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, described above, and (ii) alleged misconduct by Company employees alleged in that litigation. On April 28, 2023, a lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts by Dag Sagfors, derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant Pegasystems Inc., asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to the Virginia Appian litigation against the same defendants as the Larkin lawsuit. On May 17, 2023, the 
Larkin 
and 
Sagfors 
cases were consolidated and a joint motion to stay the consolidated case is pending before the Court (“Consolidated Action”). The Company also has received confidential demand letters raising substantially the same allegations set forth in the foregoing derivative complaints. On April 12, 2023, the Company’s board of directors (other than Mr. Trefler, who recused himself), formed a committee consisting solely of independent directors, to review, analyze, and investigate the matters raised in the demands and to determine in good faith what actions (if any) are reasonably believed to be appropriate under similar circumstances and reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Company in response to the demand letters On December 4, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in the Consolidated Action. On December 17, 2024, the plaintiffs moved to voluntarily dismiss the Consolidated Action, and the Court granted the motion on December 18, 2024.
On February 7, 2025, the plaintiffs in the Consolidated Action filed a new complaint against the members of the Company’s board of directors, certain employees of the Company, and the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, captioned Mary Larkin and Dag Sagfors, derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant Pegasystems Inc. v. Alan Trefler, Peter Gyenes, Richard Jones, Christopher Lafond, Dianne Ledingham, Sharon Rowlands, Leon Trefler, Larry Weber, Kenneth Stillwell, Don Schuerman, Kerim Akgonul, and Benjamin Baril, defendants, and Pegasystems Inc., nominal defendant (Case 1:25-cv-10303). The complaint asserts against Defendants claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violations of the Exchange Act relating to (i) the litigation brought by Appian in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, described above; (ii) alleged misconduct by Company employees alleged in that litigation; and the Class Action, described above. 
On June 28, 2024, a lawsuit was filed against members of the Company’s board of directors, certain employees of the Company and the Company in the Business Litigation Section of the Superior Court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, captioned John Dwyer and Ray Gerber, Plaintiffs, v. Alan Trefler, Peter Gyenes, Richard Jones, Christopher Lafond, Dianne Ledingham, Sharon Rowlands, Larry Weber, Leon Trefler, Don Schuerman, Kerim Akgonul, and Benjamin Baril, Defendants, and Pegasystems Inc., Nominal Defendant (Case 2484CV01734) (“Dwyer Action”). The complaint generally alleges the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with alleged misconduct by Company employees alleged in the litigation brought by Appian in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, described above, and alleges damages from the approximately $
2
 billion verdict in the litigation brought by Appian in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, described above, the settlement of the Class Action, and litigation costs from various proceedings. On October 18, 2024 the defendants served a motion to dismiss the complaint, which the defendants then withdrew on November 26, 2024 pending resolution of whether this complaint and the other derivative actions would be consolidated in Superior Court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.
On November 22, 2024, a lawsuit was filed against members of the Company’s board of directors, certain employees of the Company and the Company in the Business Litigation Section of the Superior Court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, captioned Jayne Birch and Robert Garfield, Plaintiffs, v. Alan Trefler, Peter Gyenes, Richard Jones, Christopher Lafond, Dianne Ledingham, Sharon Rowlands, Larry Weber, Leon Trefler, Kerim Akgonul, Don Schuerman, Leon Trefler, Douglas Kim, John Petronio, Benjamin Baril, and Kenneth Stillwell, Defendants, and Pegasystems Inc., Nominal Defendant (Case 2484CV03076-BLS-1) (“Birch Action”). The complaint generally alleges the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with alleged misconduct by Company employees alleged in the litigation brought by Appian in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, described above, and alleges damages from the approximately $
2
 billion verdict in the litigation brought by Appian in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, described above, the settlement of the Class Action, and litigation costs from various proceedings. The parties agreed on November 26, 2024 to suspend indefinitely the deadlines for any response to the complaint pending resolution of whether this complaint and the other derivative actions would be consolidated in the Superior Court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.
On February 4, 2025, the parties to the Dwyer and Birch Actions filed a stipulation and proposed order in the Business Litigation Section of the Superior Court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts consolidating the two actions and setting a schedule for the filing of a consolidated complaint and any motion to dismiss. Pursuant to the stipulation, a consolidated complaint must be filed by March 18, 2025, and any motion to dismiss must be served by May 15, 2025. The court held a hearing on February 11, 2025, at which it indicated it would issue an order consolidating the Dwyer and Birch Actions and approving the schedule for the filing of a consolidated complaint and a motion to dismiss. The court scheduled a hearing on the motion to dismiss for September 4, 2025.
The Company is unable to reasonably estimate possible damages or a range of possible damages in these matters given the stage of the lawsuits and there being no specified quantum of damages sought in the complaints.

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Management’s report on and changes in internal control over financial reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the framework in the updated 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) on May 14, 2013. 
Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that (i) our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 and (ii) no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm which also audited our consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
