ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Our principal administrative, sales, marketing, support, and research and development operations are in Cambridge, Massachusetts, our corporate headquarters, and Hyderabad, India. Effective January 1, 2025, our corporate headquarters was relocated to Waltham, Massachusetts. We also maintain offices elsewhere in the Americas, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific regions. All of our properties are leased. We believe we will be able to obtain future space as needed on acceptable and commercially reasonable terms.
For additional information, see "Note 10. Leases" in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
