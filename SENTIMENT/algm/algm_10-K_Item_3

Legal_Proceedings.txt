Our Mission
Our mission is to be the global leader in semiconductor technology with magnetic sensing and power solutions that drive e-Mobility, clean energy and automation.
Company Overview
The Company is a leading global designer, developer, fabless manufacturer and marketer of sensor integrated circuits (“ICs”) and application-specific power ICs, enabling the most important emerging technologies in the automotive and industrial markets. With the broadest portfolio of magnetic sensor IC solutions available, underpinned by our strong position in the automotive market, we are the leading magnetic sensor supplier worldwide based on market share. Our products are foundational to automotive and industrial electronic systems. Our sensor ICs enable our customers to precisely measure motion, speed, position and current, while our power ICs include high-temperature and high-voltage capable motor drivers, power management ICs, light emitting diode (“LED”) driver ICs and isolated gate drivers. We believe that our technology expertise, combined with our deep applications knowledge and strong customer relationships, enable us to develop solutions that provide more value to customers than typical ICs. Compared to a typical IC, our solutions are more integrated, intelligent and sophisticated for complex applications and easier for customers to use.
Growth in the global semiconductor industry is expected to be driven by technology mega trends in the automotive and industrial markets. These mega trends have created requirements for new technologies in vehicles, both in the powertrain and in the cabin, to support vehicle electrification and advanced driver assistance systems (“ADAS”). These shifts also require technology to enable intelligence and automation in factories and energy efficiency in robotics, data center and clean energy applications. According to industry experts, these mega trends are expected to increase the demand for sensing and power solutions like those we develop. We believe our patented portfolio of sensor and power ICs provides the underlying technology required to win in the presence of larger competitors.
Our longstanding history of innovation in the semiconductor industry is built on our market leading magnetic sensor IC technology. Our “first of its kind” approach took the complexity of magnetic systems design and embedded it within our solutions, dramatically simplifying customers’ design efforts while increasing system reliability. This is a pattern we have repeated over consecutive generations of products, enabling us to establish a strong presence in the most rigorous and demanding automotive markets. Our portfolio now includes more than 1,500 products, and we ship approximately 1.5 billion units annually to more than 10,000 customers worldwide. By developing sophisticated, analog mixed-signal IC solutions that incorporate our patented intellectual property and robust proprietary process technologies with our unique packaging know-how, we believe we are well-positioned to compete across all of our target markets and leverage our existing strengths in order to expand into new markets. Our established position as an incumbent supplier for the automotive market and our long product life cycles attest to the strength of this competitive advantage.
Our value proposition is based on providing complete IC solutions for motion control and energy efficient systems. This includes sensing angular or linear position, driving an electric motor or actuator, and regulating the power applied to sensing and driving circuits so they operate safely and efficiently. These capabilities are based on fundamental technical advances we have made in the field of Hall-effect and magnetoresistive (“xMR”) sensors and Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (“BCD”) power ICs. We continue to be instrumental in developing magnetic transducers and power devices on silicon, application-optimized packaging, high-temperature operation, high-speed precision signal paths for signal processing, safety and reliability all on 100-volt (“100V”) capable BCD wafer technology. We also offer tunneling magnetoresistance (“TMR”) sensor solutions that provide the highest magnetic sensitivity, lowest power consumption, and the smallest size by comparison to other magnetic technologies. In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (“HEV”) and Electric Vehicles (“EV”) with ADAS, these innovations translate to increased driving range for EVs, smaller and more reliable power conversion systems, and improved safety and efficiency of on-board chargers, DC-DC converters and battery management systems, as well as safer and more reliable steering and braking systems. Our ICs can be found in seat and battery cooling applications in addition to motors, fans and pumps in conventional and electric vehicles. In the industrial market, these technologies enable energy efficiency and improved performance in clean energy, server and data center, robotics and automation applications. These innovations improve reliability to avoid factory downtime, accurately measure current to support increased energy efficiency or improved motor control and reduce the solution footprint to lower total system cost.
We have maintained our sensor IC leadership and built our power IC business through successfully developing deep customer relationships over time. We commonly collaborate with customers early and over a multi-year period to design products capable of meeting demanding performance and quality requirements. Through this customer collaboration in product design, we believe we have unique insight into market trends and customer requirements for new, improved and innovative products. We believe that these insights enable us to develop differentiated solutions, often in advance of our competitors.

3

Our customer list includes virtually all of the world’s top automotive companies by market share and a large number of leading industrial companies. We are a preferred vendor to tier-one suppliers in the automotive industry that supply parts or systems directly to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). We are also a preferred partner or vendor to many global OEMs. Our products can be found in vehicles built by nearly every automotive OEM worldwide and in many common industrial systems. We support customers through design, application and customer support centers located in North America, South America, Asia and Europe. Our local teams in these centers work closely with our customers on their unique design requirements, often acting as an extension of a customer’s development team.
Our strategy to extend our market leadership in high-growth markets, increase our IC design footprint and capacity, and accelerate growth through enhanced sales operations relies on a fabless and asset-lite manufacturing model. We use external wafer manufacturing consisting of both standard and proprietary processes, along with internal and external assembly and test capabilities to provide both flexibility and scale. Through our subcontractor manufacturers, we are able to employ our proprietary wafer fabrication processes while leveraging our subcontractors’ manufacturing technologies and high-volume capacity. Our use of both internal and external assembly as well as test capabilities is designed to balance the protection of our proprietary technology and processes while achieving automotive quality manufacturing at scale.
Our Market
Within the global semiconductor industry, we focus on the magnetic sensor and power management IC markets.
E-Mobility
We define e-Mobility as the electrification of vehicles, including HEV and EV powertrains, and the increasing adoption of safety-focused ADAS. Recently, we are seeing increasing demand for our power products based on our 100V process technology as a result of the transition to 48V electrical architectures in electric and hybrid electric vehicles.
We are a leading provider of sensing and power solutions for vehicle electrification, building on our decades of experience in conventional powertrain efficiency and performance leadership in technologies that reduce emissions. The ability to improve efficiency is critical as OEMs strive to comply with emissions regulations and heightened customer awareness of the environmental impact of high emissions and the desire for extended driving range per charge.
As HEVs and EVs become a meaningful share of the automotive market, OEMs face challenges and opportunities to change system architectures to reduce complexities while achieving optimal energy efficiency and vehicle range. This presents several new opportunities for semiconductors, and we expect our content per vehicle will continue to increase, driven by research and development innovation to serve this high-growth market.
As an expert in delivering ICs supporting efficient power conversion in HEVs and EVs, we believe we are uniquely positioned to support increased electrification, providing the critical automotive-grade components required to enable energy-efficient and cost-effective vehicles. We believe this allows us to take advantage of the significant semiconductor content increases expected to result from the HEV and EV migration and strong growth of electrified powertrains over the coming years.
TMR technology bolsters our current sensor and position sensor product portfolio and solidifies our leading magnetic sensing market position. TMR technology enables the highest magnetic sensitivity, lowest power consumption, and the smallest size by comparison to other magnetic technologies. We believe our TMR products, which we market under the name XtremeSense™, are an ideal fit for the electric powertrain, steering and braking systems in vehicles, which require higher accuracy, greater bandwidth and lower power consumption.
Our high voltage power portfolio provides us with additional content opportunities in both HEV and EV powertrains, high-efficiency data center power supplies, clean energy power conversion systems, and in motors throughout highly automated factories. This first-to-market technology, which integrates an isolated DC-DC converter and isolated gate drivers (“IGD”) is more efficient than competitive solutions that require two chips. This not only allows customers to reduce the size of their printed circuit boards (“PCBs”), but also enables the entire system, like an on-board charger system, to shrink. We continue to innovate this technology, which will enable gallium nitride (“GaN”) and silicon carbide (“SiC”) solutions for electric vehicle powertrains and high-efficiency industrial applications.
ADAS capabilities are considered some of the most desirable features in modern vehicles and continue to be adopted in vehicles worldwide. Industry experts expect ADAS feature adoption to continue to increase over time. ADAS is a precursor to fully autonomous vehicles. While many ADAS-equipped vehicles are being produced today, as ADAS features become more sophisticated and increasingly adopted, demand for our sensor and power ICs is expected to expand in steering and braking systems. Based on industry forecasts, we believe the transition to vehicles that incorporate ADAS Level 1 through 5 technologies will drive strong adoption of sensors and power management products to support these vehicles, which in turn will enable us to increase our total available market related to ADAS and related safety and chassis technologies.

Our devices play a key role in ADAS applications, reacting to system inputs to enable collision avoidance, lane keep assist, automatic emergency braking and self-park features through automatic steering and braking. A steering system equipped with even a modest degree of automation utilizes products across our entire portfolio, including sensors, power management ICs and motor driver ICs, which we believe is indicative of the size of our potential market opportunity as ADAS applications become increasingly more sophisticated.
Adoption of ADAS technologies continues to grow, and our solutions do not require waiting for widespread adoption of fully autonomous vehicles. We already ship a significant volume of devices every year that enable ADAS capabilities in both EV and internal combustion engine (“ICE”) powertrains. Vehicles equipped with Level 1 ADAS feature sets (i.e., the capability to take control of one functionality) already use Allegro devices. For years, we have been at the forefront of enhancing safety features in ADAS applications, particularly steering and braking systems through continuous innovation and close collaboration with automakers. Our proven record of supplying devices for safety applications and experience with supporting ADAS features in high-end vehicles, combined with growing adoption of ADAS from luxury vehicles to mainstream and economy vehicles, positions us to capitalize on this rapidly expanding market opportunity.
Traditional Automotive Applications
ICE will continue to exist in some form for the foreseeable future, either in pure ICE vehicles or HEVs. OEMs continue to improve their fuel efficiency and look to Allegro to help create the most efficient ICE powertrains possible. We have decades of experience as a proven supplier in ICE powertrains to support fuel efficiency.
Our safety, comfort and convenience business, commonly referred to as body electronics, will continue to evolve with vehicle electrification, which we believe leads to more content opportunities. Systems that historically relied on engine temperature or mechanical energy are now electrifying, and new system technologies are being rolled out. New systems increase the number of fans, pumps and motors in vehicles, thereby increasing our content opportunity. We also enable safer and more energy efficient lighting and infotainment systems as we develop more advanced products and innovate with our customers.
Clean Energy and Cloud Computing
Our automotive first philosophy resonates with our industrial customers who appreciate our rigorous quality standards, devices designed to withstand extreme environments and our long product lifecycle of 10 years or more. These customers are in our target markets of clean energy and cloud computing, defined as renewable energy generation, storage and distribution, EV charging infrastructure plus data center cooling systems and power supplies.
Renewable energy, especially solar, and EV charging infrastructure are being driven by the increased electrification of a variety of products and processes and government regulations to reduce emissions. Having the technology and products to support these markets from their infancy provides us with an advantage to help customers bring their products to market more quickly. This enables us to work closely with our customers and solve challenges as they arise.

We offer one of the largest portfolios of current sensors on the market today, including those with integrated components, requiring less board space. Our “lossless” current sensor ICs are used to improve efficiency in power conversion systems and power supplies. Our 100V BCD wafer process technology and galvanically isolated current sensors are suited for higher voltage operation, and we believe the demand for current sensor ICs will increase as more solar inverters, EV chargers and data servers come to market. As the industry transitions to 48V power architectures in the data center market, our sensors and power ICs are being adopted to further improve energy efficiency enabled by this wafer process technology. In addition, we expect our GaN and SiC based IGD technology to have a strong presence in these power conversion systems with the use of a single, small-footprint package to significantly reduce system complexity while increasing efficiency.
Our motor drivers continue to be used in data center cooling applications, mainly for thermal efficiency, as these products reduce complexity and design time, while also reducing the energy consumption required to cool servers. With the advent of generative artificial intelligence, we anticipate continued growth for our motor drivers in systems for air and liquid cooling of server components.
Automatio
n
With the growing adoption of factory automation, there is increasing demand for precise motion control and energy efficient technologies presenting additional meaningful growth opportunities for us. Robotics is an area of high market growth through increased adoption of warehouse robots, assembly robots, collaborative robots, cleaning robots and humanoid robots. Customers already leverage our technology leadership in solutions optimized for high-accuracy, high-voltage and high-reliability conditions allowing us to expand our presence in these markets. Many of these applications require the same safety and accuracy specifications that we have designed into our automotive-first devices. In particular, we believe we have the potential to leverage synergies between our power and sensor solutions, including motor drivers, voltage regulators, and current, position and speed sensors, in under-penetrated opportunities within industrial automation.

5

Broad Industrial
The Broad Industrial market includes our personal mobility, or two-wheeler market, and a broad variety of other use cases from heavy equipment to telecom connectivity. Our two-wheeler business is seeing similar electrification trends as larger vehicles. Our solutions are proven in electrified powertrains and in the small form factors needed in these applications. These markets are looking for many of the same device specifications that our automotive customers use, from high voltage and high temperature performance to long life cycle, small form factors, integration and unique packaging. Our automotive quality standards result in solutions that provide robust, high performance over long lifecycles, garnering trust from our industrial customers.
Consumer Markets
The consumer markets include smart home applications, gaming, personal medical devices and consumer electronics. Our devices enable our customers in these markets to manufacture more robust and more energy-efficient products with extended battery life.
Market Opportunity
Within our target markets, a key element of our growth strategy is to increase our revenue through portfolio and customer expansion. We are a market share leader in the magnetic sensor IC market, and we believe there is considerable opportunity to continue to grow this foundational business. Recently we introduced new position sensor ICs and quickly ramped up revenue in motion control applications, particularly in the ADAS market. These position sensors, especially angle sensors, are also used in robotic motion control systems, extending the synergy to industrial applications. Our industry’s highest bandwidth current sensors are a core component in many automotive and industrial applications alike for current monitoring and efficient power conversion. We believe similar share growth opportunities exist in other adjacent areas of the magnetic sensor IC market. We also plan to grow in the magnetic sensor market through the release of more products based on our XtremeSense TMR technology.
We are also leveraging our power IC products to increase our total content within automotive and industrial applications. Designing power products specifically for ADAS and data center is part of our strategy to focus on megatrends of electrification, safety, and energy efficiency. We believe there is more opportunity for us to expand our offerings, as electrified vehicles will require more motors to run pumps and fans and as data center architecture continues to evolve to incorporate more fans, higher power fans, and advanced liquid cooling solutions.
Our latest opportunity to expand our market presence is with both our IGDs and our XtremeSense TMR technology. IGD solutions have applications in power conversion in EVs, such as on-board chargers and traction inverters, as well as in clean energy systems. Our XtremeSense TMR products have applications beyond our traditional markets, for example in continuous glucose monitoring within the personal medical market.
Increasing our Served Available Market (“SAM”)
Another focus of our growth strategy is to significantly expand our served available market by using our established position in high-value automotive and industrial applications to increase our content per system. We believe the automotive market is very attractive due to the rigorous quality and safety requirements that create meaningful challenges for new competitors and the significant technology shifts currently underway that are expected to meaningfully increase semiconductor content per vehicle.
Part of our served available market expansion is through acquisitions that open new sockets and new applications to us.
With the growth of semiconductor content opportunities related to EV and ADAS penetration already accelerating, we have seen significant increases in our electronic system content per vehicle. For example:
•
Our opportunity for vehicles adopting ADAS features is expected to grow as the adoption moves from high-end vehicles to mid- and lower-range vehicles. An additional benefit from ADAS is the content opportunity increase per system as new architectures are adopted. We believe that moving from today’s systems to electromechanical braking and steer-by-wire will nearly double the devices required per system.
•
According to our internal estimates and third-party sources, we believe that we have a total opportunity of up to approximately $100 of potential content in each battery EV or plug-in EV. The content opportunity in EV and plug-in EV is 2.5 times the content in a typical ICE vehicle.
There is a similar dynamic in the industrial market, where clean energy and automation are two mega trends requiring more semiconductor content as they gain mainstream adoption. Our current sensors, motor drivers position sensors and IGDs’ performance and reliability make them uniquely capable of delivering on customer expectations for both energy efficiency and motion control.
The robotics market is rapidly transforming and presents a new potential growth opportunity for both our sensor and power ICs. Joints in robotic arms could include several of our leading products, most commonly motor drivers to actuate the joint, and sensors for position feedback and optimized motor control. As more advanced robots are adopted at scale, the SAM expansion opportunity for us could be significant.

Research and Development Strategy
We are a technology company, and we believe our future success depends on our ability to rapidly develop and introduce differentiated new products in our target markets. As a result, we are committed to investing in our process and product development capabilities while focusing our engineering efforts on designing and introducing new application-specific products, developing new semiconductor process and packaging technologies, enhancing design productivity and evaluating new technologies. Our research and development investments are subject to a rigorous ROI review to ensure alignment with our growth and profitability targets. We believe that by effectively applying these resources, we have developed proprietary innovations and intellectual property that will give us an early lead in our target markets and will enable accelerated growth over time.
Over the last 10 years, we believe we have been instrumental in achieving fundamental developments that have enabled a number of key technology transitions in the automotive and industrial markets. We believe we are one of very few suppliers in the semiconductor industry to integrate proprietary motor control algorithms into our motion control devices to achieve optimized BLDC motor performance. We remain one of the few suppliers who has developed multiple packaging technologies capable of operating at temperatures of up to 175 degrees Celsius and including passive components and high current conductors required to make high-efficiency, high voltage current sensor products. We were also one of the first in our industry to develop automotive grade xMR technology on silicon wafers, which enabled breakthrough advances in product performance. This advanced technology is a key enabler across all of our strategic focus areas in the automotive and industrial markets as more of the e-Mobility and clean energy markets transition to xMR.
We augment our internally generated intellectual property through a mix of licensed intellectual property, partnering with industry experts, and through acquisitions. For example, the two businesses we acquired in the past three years provide leading technology, including TMR and IGD, which will expand our serviced available market, most notably in EV and clean energy.

Our global team of highly skilled engineers has extensive semiconductor development experience, including expertise in analog design, test and process technology. As of March 28, 2025, we had approximately 750 employees dedicated to research and development, with centers in the United States, Europe, South America, and Asia. The efforts of our engineering team and our strategic acquisitions have resulted in our intellectual property portfolio nearly doubling over the last three years, further strengthening our position in our target markets.
We have also made significant investments in our core engineering capabilities, including improvements in tools to support greater engineering efficiency, as well as electrical component, magnetic performance and thermal distribution modeling. We believe these improved tools enable us to more accurately evaluate and predict the performance of our designs, resulting in accelerated time-to-market for our products and satisfaction of our customers.
Our focus on meeting or exceeding the stringent automotive market safety and reliability requirements is fundamental to our research and development process. We anticipate that we will continue to make research and development investments in order to enhance our leadership position and expand our markets with innovative, high-quality products and services (as exemplified through our acquisition of IGD power group and TMR technology). In addition, our Board has a standing Strategy Committee, whose purpose is to provide leadership and guidance to management on defining and implementing the strategic direction of the Company.
Process and Packaging Technology
Our product and technology development engineers have long-established expertise in designing mixed signal power and magnetic sensor ICs using proprietary semiconductor process technologies and intelligent packaging. We consider these capabilities to be strategically important because they allow us to create complete system products and highly integrated solutions that meet the quality and robustness requirements of our most stringent automotive customers and applications. These have the benefit of advancing the feature, function and cost of ownership of our devices relative to those of our competitors. For example, we released a unique 100V- and 175-degree Celsius capable BCD wafer technology designed to handle automotive voltage and temperature transients while also integrating high-density logic circuits and electrically erasable programmable read-only memory to enable configurable and embedded algorithms, and various Hall-effect and xMR transducer technology on the same silicon wafer. These technologies are fundamental to the transition from 12V to 48V power supply required in the rapidly emerging HEV and EV markets, and to the next generation of ADAS systems. We are in the process of applying these capabilities to the industrialization of our IGD portfolio.
In choosing the process technology to be used to manufacture a new product, we seek to optimize the match between the process technology and the desired performance parameters of the product for our customers. Our current strategic semiconductor process innovations include the following:

12

Automotive Quality and Safety
We have developed, characterized and qualified our wafer and package technologies to meet or exceed the rigorous automotive requirements that our customers demand. Robust development processes and guidelines have resulted in devices capable of exceeding the requirements of AEC Q100 Automotive Grade 0 of 150 degrees Celsius, and our field failure rates are consistent with or better than customer requirements.
Integrated Transducers
One of our fundamental innovations is the integration of magnetic transducers and complementary metal oxide semiconductor circuitry into one piece of silicon to create a complete, fully integrated system. Hall-effect elements are implanted in silicon, providing robust and low noise solutions that are optimized for stress and temperature effects. Thin film, high-resolution xMR transducers are deposited directly on top of the complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”) circuitry creating a more reliable solution than multi-chip solutions by reducing interconnects and solution area. To achieve the highest level of Automotive Safety Integrity Level (“ASIL”), we are able to integrate xMR and Hall-effect transducers onto the same silicon to produce heterogeneous solutions capable of performing reliably in the most demanding automotive environments.
High-Voltage Technology
Our intellectual property, developed over years of experience in automotive applications includes advanced mixed-signal integration of high-voltage solutions with our high-precision analog designs. For example, our innovative wafer technology enables 100V capable power transistors to be combined with embedded digital logic and precision analog circuits on a monolithic motor control IC suitable for emerging 48V automotive applications. This enables a number of application-specific advancements, including taking the complex algorithm development in motor drivers into the IC, vastly reducing our customers’ design complexity and creating the most efficient and quietest solutions in the market. Similar benefits exist for our sensor products through monolithic integration of transducers with precision analog circuits and intelligent signal processing on a high-voltage IC that can be powered from a vehicle battery.
Advanced, Small Form Factor Integrated Packages
We continue to combine circuit design and process innovation with novel packaging solutions that improve performance and reliability while reducing solution footprint and our customers’ cost of ownership. Two decades of sensor package innovation have led to the development of a family of integrated systems in a package for magnetic current, position and speed sensor ICs. By integrating a combination of a magnet, magnetic core, passive components, and our silicon integrated circuit in a single body, we are able to offer inventive magnetic sensors that reduce our customers’ needs to design complex magnetic models or complex interface circuits, solve electrical interference issues with external PCBs, and enable smaller and more cost-effective customer systems. The current sensors integrate specially designed lead frames to allow a high-precision, factory-programmed single package solution that provides a unique high-efficiency and high-voltage isolation product and can sense current for products plugged directly into a household electrical outlet or connected to an 800-volt automotive battery. Years of design and manufacturing refinement have led to the latest generation of power products that integrate passive components and power conversion capabilities into small packages to reduce PCB footprint, reduce electromagnetic noise, and improve efficiency in high-power systems. Our IGDs also incorporate a DC-DC converter, a small planar transformer, and a gate driver into a small form factor package. Through innovative package integration, these IGDs minimize parasitic capacitance and significantly improve system level efficiency in electrified vehicles, clean energy, and factory automation systems. We also believe we are one of only a few companies in our industry that have developed a broad portfolio of packages that are suitable for operation in automotive environments and 175-degree Celsius temperatures.
Intellectual Property
We consider the strength of our intellectual property portfolio to be a significant competitive advantage. Our intellectual property includes patented inventions, trade secrets, accumulated technical know-how and trademarks. As of March 28, 2025, we owned 1,942 active patents, including 966 U.S. patents (with expiration dates between 2025 and 2043), with an additional 487 pending patent applications, including 252 U.S. patent applications.
We market our products worldwide under the “Allegro” name. We either hold or have applied for trademarks in all jurisdictions where we do significant business.
Competition
The semiconductor industry, particularly the market for high-performance analog mixed-signal semiconductors, is highly competitive. Although no one company competes with us across all of our product lines, we face significant competition within each of our business areas from both domestic and international semiconductor companies. Our primary magnetic sensor and power IC competitors are other semiconductor designers and manufacturers, such as Analog Devices, Infineon, Melexis, Monolithic Power Systems, TDK Micronas, and Texas Instruments.

13

Our ability to compete successfully against these companies depends on elements both within and outside of our control. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and management resources than we have. These competitive advantages may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements, or better position them to withstand adverse economic or market conditions.
We believe we can successfully compete against these organizations in our target markets by leveraging our design and market expertise and leadership position, proprietary manufacturing processes, custom packaging capabilities and close customer relationships. In addition, we compete in our target markets to varying degrees on the basis of a number of competitive factors, including:
•
time to market;
•
system and application expertise;
•
product quality and reliability;
•
quality systems and support;
•
product features and performance;
•
proprietary technology;
•
production capacity; and
•
solution price.
We believe we currently compete favorably with respect to these factors. However, we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new competitors entering our markets. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively, which could reduce our market share and decrease our net sales and profitability.”
Seasonality and Market Demand
Our business exhibits some seasonality. Historically, our net sales have generally been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half. However, various factors, such as market conditions, the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry, new product introductions and the supply chain environment, can impact the effects of seasonality on our business.
Over the past several quarters, we and other semiconductor companies have experienced a downturn in market demand, primarily driven by softening demand from customers across various markets and digestion of excess accumulated inventory. In addition, factors that cause a reduction in the demand from end users of our OEMs’ or other customers’ products, including as a result of increased prices resulting from global trade policies, tariffs or a recessionary environment in the markets in which we operate, may in the future continue to cause our direct customers to significantly reduce the number of products ordered from us.

Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulation
We recognize the importance of protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities. Our Environmental Health and Safety (“EHS”) Policy outlines policies and training programs that are designed to promote and protect employee safety. Our EHS teams oversee workplace conditions for our employees. All Allegro EHS policies and procedures are developed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Our AMPI Facility is certified to ISO 14001 for environmental management systems and ISO 45001 for occupational health and safety management systems.
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local, international, and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing pollution and environmental protection and occupational health and safety, including those related to hazardous and toxic materials, product composition, and the investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites. This includes sites we currently or formerly owned or operated, due to the release of hazardous materials, regardless of whether we caused such release. In addition, we may be strictly liable for joint and several costs associated with investigation and remediation of sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes if such sites become contaminated, even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We are also subject to various federal, state, local, international, and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations, including new laws or new interpretations of existing ones, may subject us to significant fines or other civil or criminal costs, obligations, sanctions or property damage or personal injury claims, or suspension of our facilities’ operating permits. In addition, in the event of an incident involving hazardous materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of any liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business.
We face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of environmental laws, regulations, directives and standards, as well as specific customer requirements. These laws, regulations, directives, and standards have an impact on the material composition of our products entering specific markets. For example, the European Union (“EU”) adopted its Restriction of Hazardous Substance Directive (“RoHS”) legislation, EU Directive 2002/95/EC (RoHS) and 2011/65/EU (RoHS II), amended by 2015/863/EU, which took effect in July 2019. The EU also adopted the European Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) in 2007, which calls for the progressive substitution of dangerous chemicals in manufacturing. In 2006, China first published its RoHS equivalent, the Administrative Measures on the Control of Pollution Cause by Electronic Information Products. This regulation was revised in 2016 when China enacted the Administrative Measures on the Restrictions of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products Regulations, which expanded the scope of the 2006 requirements and is designed to restrict additional hazardous substance in certain electrical and electronic products. In addition, any business selling products to consumers in California containing certain listed chemicals or substances is subject to California Proposition 65 (officially known as the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986), which requires disclosure of the listed chemical and potential health risks. In addition to these regulations and directives, we may face costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation, which holds manufacturers responsible for the collection and proper disposal of their products discarded by their customers. There are also increasing regulations regarding the use of green marketing claims, which may also affect our product design and procurement operations. Non-compliance with current or future regulations or directives could restrict our ability to expand our business or require us to modify processes and/or materials or incur other substantial expenses which could harm our business.
Although we incur costs to comply with the provisions discussed above and other applicable federal, state, local, international and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection in the ordinary course of our business, such costs have not materially affected, and are not presently expected to materially affect, our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Item 1A. R
isk Factors.
An investment in our common stock involves risks. You should consider these risks carefully, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report. If any of these risks occurs or increases in scope or severity, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed materially. In that event, the trading price of our common stock might decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not believed by us to be material may also negatively impact us.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
Downturns or volatility in general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
Our net sales, gross margin, and profitability depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which our customers compete. Weaknesses in the global economy and financial markets, including as a result of a recession and/or changes in government trade policies, such as the imposition of export restrictions and tariffs, may lead to lower demand for products that incorporate our solutions, particularly in the automotive and industrial markets. In particular, since we have significant sales in China, our business development plans, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by significant political, social and economic developments in China. Additionally, an overall decline in end-user demand can affect our customers’ demand for our products and increase the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders. Our net sales, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected by such actions.
Volatile and/or uncertain economic conditions, as well as inflationary pressures, can adversely impact sales, gross margin and profitability and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. In addition, uncertainty surrounding international trade policy and regulations as well as trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have an adverse effect on consumer confidence and spending. To the extent expected favorable economic conditions do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected, we have faced and may continue to face an oversupply of our products and have excess inventory, which could result in charges for excess and obsolete inventory, or in the case of excess inventory held by our customers, reduce the number of products purchased by our customers as they digest inventory, which we have experienced over the last several quarters. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand, we may fail to meet customer needs, which could impair our customer relationships. In addition, any disruption in the credit markets, including as a result of a recession, could impede our access to capital, which could be further adversely affected if we are unable to obtain or maintain favorable credit ratings. If we have limited access to additional financing sources, we may be required to defer capital expenditures or seek other sources of liquidity, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Similarly, if our suppliers or customers face challenges in obtaining credit or other financial difficulties, they may be unable to provide the materials we need to manufacture or purchase our products. All of these factors related to global economic conditions, which are beyond our control, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
We face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively, which could reduce our market share and decrease our net sales and profitability.
We participate in intensely competitive end markets in the global semiconductor industry. Our competitive landscape includes rapid technological change in product design and manufacturing, continuous declines in ASPs, and customers who make purchase decisions based on a mix of factors of varying importance, which varies from customer-to-customer and from market-to-market. Our ability to compete in this environment depends on many factors, including our ability to identify emerging markets and technology trends in an accurate and timely manner, introduce new and innovative products, implement new manufacturing technologies at a sustainable pace, maintain the performance and quality of our products, and manufacture our products in a cost-effective manner. For example, semiconductor IC suppliers must meet increasingly stringent quality standards of certain OEMs and customers, particularly for automotive applications. While we strive to meet these requirements, we, as well as our third-party OSAT or wafer vendors, may experience problems in achieving acceptable quality results in the manufacture of our products, particularly in connection with production of new products or adoption of a new manufacturing process. Our failure to achieve acceptable quality levels in such instances could adversely affect our competitive position and business results.
Often, we compete against larger companies that possess substantial financial, technical, development, engineering, manufacturing, including wafer fabrication capabilities, and marketing resources. Varying combinations of these resources provide advantages to these competitors, such as the rapid implementation of artificial intelligence strategies for developing products and service offerings, which enable them to influence industry trends and the pace at which they adapt to these trends. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a shift in customer preferences to competitors’ products, could result in increased pressure to lower our prices more rapidly than anticipated, increased sales and marketing expense, and/or market share loss. In addition, certain countries, such as China, have begun implementing initiatives to build domestic semiconductor supply chains, and our supply chain strategies for competing in such countries may be unsuccessful in fully eliminating the competitive disadvantages that we face. To the extent our profitability is negatively impacted by competitive pressures and reduced pricing, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected.

18

We rely on a limited number of third-party semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities and a limited number of suppliers of other materials, and the failure of any of these suppliers to supply wafers or other materials on a timely basis could harm our business and our financial results.
We currently rely on a limited number of third-party wafer fabrication facilities for the fabrication of semiconductor wafers used in the manufacture of our IC products, primarily United Microelectronics Corporation (“UMC”), Polar Semiconductor, LLC (“PSL”), Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (“Tower”) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (“TSMC”), and we purchase a number of key materials and components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources. We depend on these foundries and other sources to meet our production needs. These foundries have limited production capacities with little ability to quickly expand capacity. From time to time, we have encountered shortages and delays in obtaining wafers and other components and materials as well as export restrictions on certain components and materials, and we may encounter additional shortages, delays and restrictions in the future. For example, in December 2024, China imposed export restrictions on certain minerals, including antimony, which certain of our wafer foundry partners use in the manufacture of our IC products, and beginning in April 2025 China announced additional restrictions on the export of rare-earth metals used in some of our applications and in end-user products that contain our products which could disrupt our ability to source materials for our products, upend supply chains or drive down the demand for our products. Additionally, two of our third-party wafer fabrication facilities are located in Taiwan, a location where earthquakes are commonplace, and geopolitical changes in China-Taiwan relations could disrupt their operations. If we cannot supply our products due to a lack of components, are unable to source materials, such as antimony or other rare-earth metals, from other suppliers, to redesign products with other components in a timely manner, or OEMs or our other customers are unable to access the materials they need to produce the end products that our applications are used in our business will be significantly harmed. We do not have long-term contracts with some of our suppliers and third-party manufacturers. As a result, any such supplier or third-party manufacturer can discontinue supplying components or materials to us at any time and without penalty. Moreover, we depend on the quality of the wafers and other components and materials that they supply to us, over which we have limited control. Our suppliers’ abilities to meet our requirements could be impaired or interrupted by factors beyond their control, such as global market conditions, changes in tariffs or other trade regulations, natural disasters or other disruptions. If any one or more of our suppliers is unable or unwilling to deliver us products and we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply for such materials or components on a timely basis, our operations may be adversely affected. In addition, even if we identify any such alternative sources of supply, we could experience delays in testing, evaluating and validating materials or products of potential alternative suppliers or products we obtain through outsourcing. Qualifying new contract manufacturers, and specifically semiconductor foundries, is time-consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. Furthermore, financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers, or significant changes in demand for the components or materials they use in the products they supply to us, could limit the availability of those products, components or materials to us. We are also subject to potential delays in the development by our suppliers of key components, which may affect our ability to introduce new products. Any of these problems or delays could damage our relationships with our customers, adversely affect our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to grow our business.
Failure to adjust our purchase commitments and inventory management based on changing market conditions or customer demand could result in an inability to meet customer demand or additional charges for obsolete or excess inventories or non-cancellable purchase commitments or reduced sales in periods when customers digest excess inventory.
We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on outsourced contract manufacturing, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. The short-term nature of the commitments by many of our customers and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate future requirements of our customers. On occasion, our customers may require rapid increases in production, and we may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers’ demands. Conversely, downturns in the semiconductor industry are causing, and may in the future cause, our customers to significantly reduce the number of products ordered from us as they digest excess inventory. Because many of our sales, research and development and manufacturing expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand has resulted, and may continue to result, in a decrease in our gross margins and operating income.

19

In addition, we base operating decisions, and enter into purchase commitments, on the basis of anticipated net sales trends, which are highly unpredictable. Changes in forecasts or the timing of orders from customers expose us to risks of inventory shortages or excess inventory. Some of our purchase commitments are not cancellable, and in some cases we are required to recognize a charge representing the amount of material or capital equipment purchased or ordered, which exceeds our actual requirements. For example, we have noncancellable purchase commitments with vendors and “take-or-pay” agreements with certain of our third-party wafer fabrication partners, under which we are required to purchase a minimum number of wafers per year or face financial penalties. These types of commitments and agreements have reduced and may continue to reduce, our ability to adjust our inventory to address declining market demands. Over the past several quarters, we and other semiconductor companies have experienced a downturn in market demand, which has caused us to record substantive charges for excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur other inventory-related charges. If net sales in future periods fall substantially below our expectations, or if we fail to accurately forecast changes in demand mix, we could again be required to record substantial charges for obsolete or excess inventories or noncancellable purchase commitments. Moreover, during a market upturn we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities and maximizing our net sales. Our failure to adjust our supply chain volume, secure sufficient supply from our third-party vendors, including our semiconductor wafer suppliers, or estimate our customers’ demand could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, business, financial condition and results of operations.
Shifts in our product mix, customer mix or channel mix may result in declines in gross margin.
Gross margins on individual products typically fluctuate over the product’s life cycle. Our overall gross margins have fluctuated from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix, customer mix, channel mix, the introduction of new products, decreases in ASPs for older products and our ability to reduce product costs. In addition, in periods of high demand for some of our products, we may have to source a portion of materials from higher-cost providers, which may decrease overall gross margin. These fluctuations are expected to continue in the future.
The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may limit our ability to maintain or improve our net sales and profitability.
The semiconductor industry, including the analog segment in which we compete, is highly cyclical and is prone to significant downturns from time to time. Cyclical downturns can result from a variety of market forces, which can result in significant declines in analog semiconductor demand. We are currently experiencing a downturn and may experience downturns in the future. Downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of ASPs. Recent downturns in the semiconductor industry had been attributed to a variety of factors, including weakness in demand and pricing for semiconductors across applications, ongoing trade disputes among the United States and China, and excess inventory. Downturns directly impact our business, and any prolonged or significant future downturns in the semiconductor industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, significant upturns can cause us to be unable to satisfy demand in a timely and cost-efficient manner and could result in increased competition for access to third-party foundry and assembly capacity. In the event of such an upturn, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, including semiconductor wafers from our third-party wafer manufacturing partners, or locate suitable third-party suppliers or other third-party subcontractors to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing or new products, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
Substantial portions of our sales are made to automotive industry suppliers. Downturns or disruptions in the automotive market or industry have harmed and in the future could significantly harm, our financial results.
Our customers that supply various systems and components to automotive OEMs accounted for 73.8%, 72.4%, and 66.4% of our total net sales in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. This concentration of sales exposes us to the risks associated with the automotive market and automotive industry. For example, our anticipated future growth is highly dependent on the increased adoption of automotive technologies and HEV and EV powertrain vehicles, which traditionally have had increased sensor and power product content. A downturn in the automotive market or prolonged disruption could delay automakers’ plans to introduce new vehicles with these features, which would negatively impact the demand for our products and the ability to grow our business. Disruptions in the automotive industry due to changes in tariffs or other trade regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in March 2025, the United States Government released a proclamation adjusting tariffs on automobiles and automobile parts into the United States. Such tariffs, as well as any potential retaliatory tariffs, could substantially disrupt the automotive market or industry and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, tariffs could make our OEM and other end customers’ products less attractive relative to products offered by their competitors, which may not be subject to similar tariffs. Some OEM and end customers in our industry have already implemented short-term price adjustments to offset such tariffs and transitioned their production and supply chain to locations outside of China.

20

Acquisitions of other companies or technologies, may create additional risks, including risks associated with our ability to successfully integrate these acquisitions into our business.
We have acquired other companies as part of our growth strategy, and we continue to consider future acquisitions of other companies, or their technologies or products, to improve our market position, broaden our technological capabilities, and expand our product offerings. Acquiring companies or technologies involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to: the potential disruption of our ongoing business; the increased costs incurred to finance acquisitions and the allocation of capital to fund acquisitions being diverted from other operational priorities, such as research and development; unexpected costs or incurring unknown liabilities; the diversion of management resources from other strategic and operational issues; difficulty in developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company within the anticipated costs and timeframe; the inability to retain key employees of the acquired businesses; difficulties relating to integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses; adverse effects on our existing customer relationships or the existing customer relationships of acquired businesses; the potential incompatibility of the acquired business or their customers; issues not discovered during our due diligence that could impact our assumptions concerning the status of and prospects for the products and technologies of the acquired business; and acquired intangible assets, including goodwill, becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business. If we are unable to successfully address any of these risks, our business could be harmed.
Decreases in average selling prices of our products and increases in input costs may reduce our gross margins.
The market for our products is generally characterized by declining ASPs, resulting from factors such as increased competition, overcapacity, the amount of inventory held by our customers, the introduction of new products and increased unit volumes. We have in the past experienced, and in the future may experience, substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to declining ASPs. ASPs may decrease in the future in response to the introduction of new products by us or our competitors, or due to other factors, including customer pricing pressures. In order to sustain profitable operations, we must continually reduce costs for our existing products and also develop and introduce new products with enhanced features on a timely basis that can be sold initially at higher ASPs. Failure to do so could cause our net sales and gross margins to decline, which would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations and could significantly harm our business.
We may be unable to reduce the cost of our products sufficiently to enable us to compete with others. Our cost reduction efforts may not allow us to keep pace with competitive pricing pressures given the increased cost of certain materials, such as semiconductor wafers and other raw materials, and could adversely affect our gross margins. We maintain an infrastructure of facilities and human resources in several locations around the world and, as a result, have limited ability to reduce our operating costs. Accordingly, in order to remain competitive, we must continually reduce the cost of manufacturing our products through design and engineering changes. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in redesigning our products and bringing redesigned products to the market in a timely manner, or that any redesign will result in sufficient cost reductions to allow us to reduce the price of our products to remain competitive or maintain or improve our gross margins. To the extent we are unable to reduce the prices of our products and remain competitive, our net sales will likely decline, resulting in further pressure on our gross margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to grow our business.
If we encounter sustained yield problems or other delays at our third-party wafer fabrication facilities or in the final assembly and test of our products, we may lose sales and damage our customer relationships.
The manufacture of our products, including the fabrication of semiconductor wafers, and the assembly and testing of our products, are complex and sensitive to many factors, including levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the wafer fabrication process or other issues that can cause a substantial portion of the components on a wafer to be nonfunctional. These problems may be difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and often are time-consuming and expensive to correct. From time to time, we have experienced problems in achieving acceptable yields at our third-party wafer fabrication partners, resulting in delays in the availability of components. Moreover, an increase in the rejection rate of products during the quality control process before, during or after manufacture and/or shipping of such products, results in lower yields and margins. In addition, changes in manufacturing processes required due to changes in product specifications, changing customer needs and the introduction of new product lines have historically significantly reduced our manufacturing yields, resulting in low or negative margins on those products. Poor manufacturing yields over a prolonged period of time could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis and harm our customer relationships, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

21

Our quarterly net sales and operating results are difficult to predict accurately and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. As a result, we may fail to meet the expectations of investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.
We operate in a highly dynamic industry, and our future operating results could be subject to significant fluctuations, particularly on a quarterly basis. Our quarterly net sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. Although some of our customers provide us with non-binding forecasts of their future requirements for our products, a significant percentage of our net sales in each fiscal quarter is dependent on sales that are booked and shipped during that fiscal quarter, and are typically attributable to a large number of orders from diverse customers and markets. As a result, accurately forecasting our operating results in any fiscal quarter is difficult. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, our stock price may decline. Additional factors that can contribute to fluctuations in our operating results include the timing of customer qualification of our products and commencement of volume sales by our customers of systems that include our products, product rates of return or price concessions in excess of those expected or forecasted, as well as the other risk factors identified in this section of our Annual Report.
We may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenues for a number of reasons. Open orders at the beginning of each quarter are typically lower than expected net sales for that quarter and are generally cancellable or reschedulable with minimal notice. Accordingly, we depend on obtaining orders during each quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve our net sales objectives, and failure to fulfill such orders by the end of a quarter may adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, our customer agreements typically provide that the customer may delay scheduled delivery dates and cancel orders within specified timeframes without significant penalty. Because we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term, any delay in generating or recognizing forecasted net sales or changes in levels of our customers’ forecasted demand could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Due to our limited ability to reduce expenses, in the event our revenues decline or our net sales do not meet our expectations, it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results will decrease from the previous quarter or fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. As a result of these factors, our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not solely be relied upon as indications of future performance. Any shortfall in net sales or net income compared to a previous quarter or to levels expected by the investment community could cause a decline in the trading price of our stock.
Our dependence on our manufacturing operations in the Philippines exposes us to certain risks that may harm our business.
We rely heavily on the manufacturing operations of the AMPI Facility, which operates as our primary internal assembly and testing facility. We depend on the AMPI Facility for our sensor and power products, and if this facility suspends operations, our ability to assemble and test our products could be materially impaired. Furthermore, any disruption in operations at the AMPI Facility could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner, or at all, which would lead to a reduction in our net sales and may adversely affect our reputation and customer relationships, potentially resulting in longer-term harm to our business. In addition, an earthquake, fire, flood or other natural or man-made disaster, as well as a pandemic, epidemic or other outbreak of infectious disease, strikes, political or civil unrest, or any number of other factors beyond our control could also disable the facility, causing catastrophic losses. Although we supplement the assembly capabilities at the AMPI Facility with other external or independent assembly subcontractors throughout Asia, if our manufacturing operations at the AMPI Facility are disrupted, it could take additional time and cost, for us to resume manufacturing at another location, which could materially harm our manufacturing efficiency and capacity, delay production and shipments and result in costly expenditures to repair or replace this facility.
We have established or invested in alternative manufacturing facilities and may in the future be required to establish or invest in additional alternative manufacturing facilities. Such attempts to establish or invest in alternative manufacturing facilities, however, could increase our costs, negatively affect our profitability, and limit our ability to maintain competitive prices for our products. Only a few alternative manufacturing facilities have the capability to assemble and test our most advanced and complex products, and if we are forced to engage such alternative manufacturing facilities, we may encounter difficulties and incur additional costs. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manage the risks and challenges associated with our dependence on the AMPI Facility, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

22

A significant portion of our net sales are generated through distributors, which subjects us to certain risks.
We sell our products worldwide through multiple sales channels, including through our direct sales force, distributors and independent sales representatives, which resell our products to numerous end customers. A significant portion of our net sales are made to distributors, which were approximately 50.7%, 52.9% and 39.3% of our net sales in fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, excluding our former distribution relationship with Sanken in Japan, which represented approximately 16.5% of our net sales in fiscal year 2023. Sales to our largest, non-affiliated distributor accounted for 9.3%, 10.2% and 10.8% of our net sales in fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The impairment or termination of our relationships with our distributors, or the failure of these parties to diligently sell our products, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and profits. Additionally, if our distributors are unable to accurately forecast end customer demand for our products, we may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. Our purchases or commitments to purchase inventory are based on, among other things, our distributors’ forecasts of end customer demand. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, situations where such demand does not materialize as forecasted, where inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or where customers reduce, delay, or cancel orders. Some of these factors have resulted in, and may in the future result in, excess or obsolete inventory charges. Conversely, if we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in our distributors’ forecasted demand, this could strain our manufacturing and supply chain operations and negatively impact our working capital. Because our distributors control the relationships with end customers, if our relationship with any distributor ends, we could also lose our relationships with their customers. In addition, because our distributors do not sell our products exclusively, they may focus their sales efforts and resources on other products that produce better margins or greater commissions for them or are incorporated into a broader strategic relationship with one of their other suppliers. Because we do not control the sales representatives and other employees of our distributors, we cannot guarantee that our sales processes, regulatory compliance and other priorities will be consistently communicated and executed. Further, we may not have staff in one or more of the locations covered by our distributors, which makes it particularly difficult for us to monitor their performance. Despite our efforts to mitigate risks associated with noncompliance by our distributors, there remains a risk that they will not comply with regulatory requirements or our requirements and policies. Actions by sales representatives and other employees of our distributors could result in flat or declining sales in a given geographic area, reputational harm to us or our products, or legal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to the risk of losing customers, the operation of local laws and our agreements with our distributors could make it difficult for us to replace a distributor we feel is underperforming.
Events beyond our control impacting us, our key suppliers or our manufacturing partners could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our ability to make, transport and sell products in coordination with our suppliers, customers (including OEMs), distributors and third-party manufacturers or other subcontractors is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to either our or our key suppliers or manufacturing partners’ supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from weather, freight carrier availability, natural disaster, disease, fire, explosion, cyber-attacks, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics or other outbreaks of infectious disease, strikes, civil unrest, repairs or enhancements at facilities manufacturing or distributing our products or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture, sell, and deliver products on a timely basis or at all. Climate change may also increase the frequency or intensity of certain of these risks, as well as contribute to various chronic changes (such as sea-level rise or changes to meteorological and hydrological patterns) that may result in similar risks.

Other companies in our industry may be affected differently by natural disasters or other disruptions depending on the location and concentration of their suppliers, operations and customers. In addition, many of our competitors are larger companies with more substantial financial and other resources and, as a result, may be better able to plan for, withstand or otherwise mitigate the effects of any such disruption. While we may take steps to plan for or address the occurrence of any such event, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful. Our failure to take adequate steps to reduce the likelihood or mitigate the potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a wafer or packaging component is sourced from a limited number of locations or suppliers, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and/or require additional resources to restore our supply chain.

23

If we fail in a timely and cost-effective manner to develop new product features or new products that address customer preferences and achieve market acceptance, our operating results could be adversely affected.
Our customers seek new products with more features and functionality at a lower cost, and our success relies heavily on our ability to continue to develop and market to our customers new and innovative products and improvements of existing products, including those that may incorporate, or are based or developed using, software or artificial intelligence technologies. In order to respond to new and evolving customer demands, achieve strong market share and keep pace with new technological, processing and other developments, we must continually introduce new and innovative products into the market. Although we strive to respond to customer preferences and industry expectations in the development of our products, we may not be successful in developing, introducing or commercializing any new or enhanced products on a timely basis or at all. Further, if initial sales volumes for new or enhanced products do not reach anticipated levels within the time periods we expect, we may be required to engage in additional marketing efforts to promote such products and the costs of developing and commercializing such products may be higher than we predict. Moreover, new and enhanced products may not perform as expected. We may encounter lower manufacturing yields and longer delivery schedules in commencing volume production of new products that we introduce, which could increase costs and disrupt supply of such products.
A fundamental shift in technologies, particularly one that impacts magnetic or power ICs, the regulatory climate or demand patterns and preferences in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or end-users could make our current products obsolete or more expensive relative to alternatives, prevent or delay the introduction of new products or enhancements to our existing products or render our products irrelevant to our customers’ needs. If our new product development efforts fail to align with the needs of our customers, including due to circumstances outside of our control, such as a fundamental shift in the product markets of our customers and end users or regulatory changes, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
We depend on growth in the end markets that use our products. Any slowdown in the growth of these end markets could adversely affect our financial results.
Our continued success will depend in large part on general economic growth and growth within our target markets in the automotive and industrial sectors. Factors affecting these markets, including reductions in sales of our customers’ products, deterioration of our customers’ financial condition, insufficient customer resources dedicated to promoting and commercializing their products, the inability of our customers to adapt to changing technological demands, design flaws in customer products, the effects of catastrophic and other disruptive events, and increased supply chain, manufacturing or production costs could seriously harm our customers and, as a result, harm us. Any slowdown in the growth of these end markets could adversely affect our financial results. For example, a significant element of our growth strategy depends on the increasing adoption of (i) HEVs and EVs, which are expected to have higher sensor and power product content, and (ii) our products in the industrial market, which have applications in clean energy and EV charging, both of which we anticipate will benefit from a transition to lower emission vehicles and clean energy. If anticipated demand in the end market for these vehicles and products does not materialize or if widespread adoption takes longer than we project, it would adversely affect demand for our products from customers and impact our ability to execute our growth strategy.

The loss of one or more significant end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
The loss of or a significant reduction in business with one or more significant end customers, particularly in the automotive market, could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and, in turn, on our overall business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our ability to identify, enter and expand in new markets may be unsuccessful, and our investments in these opportunities may not generate expected returns, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
As part of our growth strategy, we seek to expand our addressable markets by identifying and entering both new geographic markets and increasing and expanding the number and types of applications our products can be used in. For example, we are exploring opportunities and increasing investment to pursue opportunities in applications such as artificial intelligence, medical devices and robotics, and in geographic markets where we have not historically had a strong presence. Our future success depends in part on our ability to successfully identify these opportunities, make the necessary investments to pursue them, overcome marketing and technological challenges, and ultimately generate and expand revenue and achieve appropriate margins from these efforts.
Our ability to generate significant revenue from new markets and applications for our products will depend on various factors, including: the development and growth rate of these markets; the ability of our technologies and product solutions to address the specific needs, price and performance requirements of customers and end users in these markets; our ability to provide solutions that offer advantages in terms of performance, quality, reliability, and value-added features compared with alternative solutions and competitive offerings; the ability to adapt to market conditions, distribution channels, and customer relationships that may be unfamiliar to us; the timely and efficient completion of product development, manufacturing, assembly, and test processes suitable for these markets; and the effectiveness of our marketing, sales, and support efforts in these new areas.
Many potential customers in these markets may have well-established relationships with competitive suppliers. Our ongoing success will require us to offer compelling alternatives at competitive costs. The markets for certain of these products may develop slower than anticipated, or not at all, or could utilize competing technologies. If we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new conditions, or if we fail to timely introduce new products or penetrate these markets successfully, our investments may not generate expected returns, our sales growth could be impeded, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
The nature of the design win process requires us to incur expenses without any guarantee that research and development efforts will generate net sales,

and even if design wins are secured, such design wins may not generate timely or sufficient net sales or margins, which could adversely affect our financial results.
We focus on winning competitive bid selection processes, called “design wins,” to develop products for use in our customers’ products. Our future sales are highly dependent on our continued success at winning design mandates. These lengthy selection processes may require us to incur significant expenditures and dedicate valued engineering resources to the development of new products without any assurance that we will achieve design wins. If we incur such expenditures and fail to be selected in the bid selection process, our operating results may be adversely affected. Further, because of the significant costs associated with qualifying new suppliers, customers are likely to use the same or an enhanced version of semiconductor products from existing suppliers across a number of similar and successor products for a lengthy period of time. As a result, if we fail to secure an initial design win for any of our products to a customer, we may lose the opportunity to make future sales of those products to that customer. Failure to achieve initial design wins may also weaken our position in future competitive selection processes because we may not be perceived as an industry leader.

Even if we succeed in securing design wins, we may not generate timely or sufficient net sales or margins from those wins, as a substantial period of time generally elapses before we generate meaningful net sales relating to such products for which we secure design wins, if such sales are realized at all. The reasons for this delay may include: changing customer requirements, resulting in an extended development cycle for the product; delay in the volume production ramp up of customer products into which we design solutions; delay or cancellation of customers’ product development plans; competitive pressures to reduce our product selling price; the discovery of product design flaws, defects, errors or bugs; lower than expected customer acceptance of solutions designed for customers’ products; lower than expected market acceptance of customers’ products; and higher manufacturing costs than anticipated. If we do not continue to achieve design wins in the short term, we may not be able to achieve expected net sales levels associated with these design wins. If we experience delays in achieving such sales levels, our operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, even if a customer selects our product, we cannot guarantee that this will result in any sales of our products, as the customer may ultimately change or cancel its product plans, or our customers’ efforts to market and sell its product may not be successful.

25

Changes in government trade policies, including the imposition of export restrictions and tariffs or retaliatory measures in response to such actions, could limit our ability to sell products to certain customers or limit demand from certain customers, which may materially and adversely affect our sales and results of operations.
The U.S. or foreign governments may take or threaten to take administrative, legislative or regulatory action that could materially interfere with our ability to sell products in certain countries and/or to certain customers, particularly in China. For example, the United States and China have imposed export restrictions related to certain semiconductors and a number of tariffs and other restrictions on items imported or exported between the United States and China and may propose or threaten to impose additional tariffs in the future. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to export restrictions, tariffs or trade relations between the United States and China or other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. The institution of export restrictions and trade tariffs both globally and between the United States and China specifically carries the risk of negatively impacting China’s overall economic condition, which could have negative repercussions for our business since Greater China accounted for the highest percentage of the Company’s total net sales in any one country in fiscal year 2025.
In addition, since we manufacture our products outside the United States, new or increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States, if adopted, could have a disproportionate impact on our business and make our products more expensive and less competitive in domestic markets. Furthermore, changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, which could impose restrictions on our ability to do business in or with affected countries or prohibit, reduce or discourage purchases of our products by foreign customers, leading to increased costs of components contained in our products, increased costs of manufacturing our products, and higher prices for our products in foreign markets. For example, there are risks that the Chinese government may require the use of local suppliers in place of non-Chinese suppliers like us, compel companies that do business in China to partner with local companies to conduct business and provide incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local suppliers. Moreover, changes in tariffs and trade restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice. The adoption and expansion of tariffs or other trade restrictions, increasing trade tensions, or other changes in governmental policies related to taxes, tariffs, trade agreements or policies, are difficult to predict, which makes attendant risks difficult to anticipate and mitigate. Furthermore, changes in U.S. foreign policy or trade agreements may impact our supply chain, manufacturing and distribution of our products, as suppliers face increased costs and logistical challenges, which could result in delays in product delivery and increased inventory costs. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policy could reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales to decline, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Warranty claims, product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims if products fail to perform as expected or any such failure is alleged to result in bodily injury, death, and/or property damage. In addition, if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in their recalls. Some OEMs expect suppliers to warrant their products for longer periods of time and are increasingly looking to them for contribution when faced with product liability claims or recalls. For example, some of our products are used in automotive safety systems, the failure of which could lead to injury or death. We carry various commercial liability policies, including umbrella/excess policies which provide some protection against product liability exposure. However, a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage and established reserves, or a requirement that we participate in a product recall, could have adverse effects on our business results. Further, in the future, it is possible that we will not be able to obtain insurance coverage in the amounts and for the risks we seek at policy costs and terms we desire. Additionally, if our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results in a recall, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

26

Our dependence on international customers and operations also subjects us to a range of other additional regulatory, operational, financial and political risks that could adversely affect our financial results.
For fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, approximately 87.2%, 85.8% and 86.6%, respectively, of our net sales were to customers outside of the United States. In addition, a substantial majority of our products are assembled and tested at facilities outside of the United States. Our principal assembly and test facility is located in the Philippines at our AMPI Facility. We also rely on several other wafer fabrication manufacturing partners located throughout Asia. Any conflict or uncertainty in this region, including public health or safety concerns or natural disasters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, conducting business outside the United States subjects us to a number of additional risks and challenges, including:
•
changes in a specific country’s or region’s political, regulatory or economic conditions;
•
a pandemic, epidemic or other outbreak of an infectious disease, which may cause us or our distributors, vendors and/or customers to temporarily suspend operations in the affected city or country;
•
compliance with a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws, regulations and policies (including those of municipalities or provinces where we have operations) and unexpected changes in those laws and regulatory requirements, including uncertainties regarding taxes, social insurance contributions and other payroll taxes and fees to governmental entities, tariffs, quotas, export controls, export licenses and other trade barriers or restrictions, and climate-related laws and regulations;
•
unanticipated restrictions on our ability to sell to foreign customers where sale of products and provision of services may require export licenses or are prohibited by government action, unfavorable foreign exchange controls and currency exchange rates;
•
the risk of substantial penalties and litigation related to violations of a wide variety of laws, treaties and regulations, including labor regulations and anti-corruption regulations;
•
difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations across different geographic areas and cultures;
•
potential political, legal and economic instability, armed conflict, and civil unrest in the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers and contract manufacturers are located, such as macroeconomic weakness related to trade and political disputes between the United States and China, tensions across the Taiwan Strait, the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East;
•
difficulty and costs of maintaining effective data security;
•
inadequate protection of intellectual property;
•
transportation and other supply chain delays and disruptions;
•
nationalization and expropriation;
•
restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including withholding taxes and other potentially negative tax consequences;
•
unfavorable and/or changing foreign tax treaties and policies; and
•
increased exposure to general market and economic conditions outside of the U.S.
These factors, individually or in combination, could impair our ability to effectively operate one or more of our foreign facilities or deliver our products, result in unexpected and material expenses, or cause an unexpected decline in the demand for our products in certain countries or regions. Our failure to manage the risks and challenges associated with our international business and operations could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, the military conflict between Israel and Hamas and the potential for regional expansion; any deterioration in the relations between Taiwan and China, and other factors affecting military, political or economic conditions in Taiwan or elsewhere in Asia; and the continuing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia, as well as the financial and trade-related restrictions associated with Russia and Belarus and economic sanctions on certain individuals and entities in Russia and Belarus, could adversely impact the global supply chain, disrupt our operations and/or our customers’ operations, negatively impact the demand for our products in our primary end markets or lead to an increase in cyberattacks and espionage.

27

End-user demand for certain HEVs, EVs and green energy products often depends on the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives. The reduction, modification, expiration or elimination of such government economic incentives could reduce end-user demand and thus affect our customers’ demand for our products.
The U.S. federal government, some state and local governments, as well as foreign governments provide certain incentives to end-users and purchasers of certain HEVs, EVs and green energy products in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives. End-users often rely on these governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives to significantly lower the purchase price of these products. However, these incentives may expire on a particular date, end when the allocated funding is exhausted, or be reduced or terminated as a matter of regulatory or legislative policy. For example, in January 2025, the United States released an executive order instructing the federal government to consider eliminating “unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase.” Additionally, lawmakers may pass laws levying additional taxes on EVs to offset lost gas tax revenues. Any slowdown in end-user demand for our products as a result of such changes to these incentives could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may lose sales if we are unable to obtain government authorization to export certain technology for our products, and we will be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations.
Exports to certain manufacturers of technology relating to our products are subject, or could be subject in the future, to export controls imposed by the U.S. government and administered by the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce. In certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department. For products subject to the Export Administration Regulations, administered by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product, the final destination, the identity of the end user and whether a license exception might apply. Products developed and manufactured in our foreign locations are subject to export controls of the applicable foreign nation. Obtaining export licenses can be difficult, costly and time-consuming, and we may not always be successful in obtaining necessary export licenses. Our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products or limitations on our ability to manufacture or sell our products imposed by these laws may harm our international and domestic revenues. Noncompliance with these laws could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. Failure to obtain export licenses for technology relating to our products or having one or more of our customers be restricted from receiving exports from us could significantly reduce our net sales and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business could be negatively affected as a result of unsolicited acquisition proposals.
In the past we have received unsolicited, non-binding proposals to acquire us, which our Board carefully considered in consultation with our independent financial and legal advisors. Responding to such proposals, even if they are ultimately rejected, is costly and time-consuming, disrupting to our operations and diverts the attention of management and our employees. These activities lead to uncertainty among our customers, employees, and business partners regarding our future direction, resulting in lost business opportunities, difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, and challenges in maintaining key business relationships. Furthermore, speculation about potential acquisitions causes volatility in our stock price, which could also disrupt our ability to access the capital markets for financing purposes.

Changing currency exchange rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We have operations and assets in the U.S. as well as foreign jurisdictions and prepare our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, but a portion of our earnings and expenditures are denominated in other currencies. Therefore, we must translate our foreign assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in our financial statements. In addition, since many of our sales in foreign jurisdictions are denominated in U.S. dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may effectively increase the price of our products in the currency of the jurisdiction in which the sale took place and may result in our products becoming too expensive for non-U.S. customers who do not conduct their business in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, currency exchange rates can be volatile, and such currency fluctuations may make it difficult for us to predict our results of operations. It is possible that government policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase currency exchange rate fluctuations. If we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure adequately, we may suffer losses in the value of our net foreign currency investment, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.

28

Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited and could prevent us from executing our growth strategy.
Our ability to operate and expand our business depends on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn depends on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities and other debt, equity or other applicable financing arrangements. We believe that our existing cash resources and our access to the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy, and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. However, we have based this estimate on our current operating plans and expectations, which are subject to change, and cannot assure you that our existing resources will be sufficient to meet our future liquidity needs. We may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or other strategic transactions and/or unforeseen circumstances. The timing and amount of our working capital and capital expenditure requirements may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including: market acceptance of our products; the need to adapt to changing technologies and technical requirements; the existence of opportunities for expansion; and access to and availability of sufficient management, technical, marketing and financial personnel. In addition, it is possible that government policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase market volatility, which may lead to adverse changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital.

If our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity securities or debt securities or obtain debt financing. The sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. Additional debt would result in increased expenses and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations and our ability to incur additional debt or engage in other capital-raising activities. Interest rates have remained elevated over the last year and may remain elevated or rise, making the cost of incurring new debt obligations more expensive to the Company. There is no assurance that financing, if required, will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow and support our business and respond to business opportunities and challenges could be significantly limited.
Our indebtedness may limit our flexibility to operate our business and adversely affect our financial health and competitive position.
As of March 28, 2025, we had $345.0 million in aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under our 2025 Refinanced Loans (as defined herein), no debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $256.0 million of additional borrowings available thereunder. To service this indebtedness, and any additional indebtedness or other long-term obligations we may incur in the future, we need to generate sufficient levels of cash from our operating activities. Our ability to generate cash is subject, in part, to our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will be able to generate sufficient levels of cash from operations or that future borrowings or other financings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness and fund our other liquidity needs. To the extent we are required to use cash from operations or the proceeds of any future financing to service our indebtedness instead of funding working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes, we will be less able to plan for, or react to, changes in our business, industry and in the economy generally. This will place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.
In addition, the agreements governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined herein) contain, and any agreements evidencing or governing other future indebtedness may also contain, certain covenants that limit our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to engage in certain transactions that may be in our long-term best interests. Subject to certain limited exceptions, these covenants include limitations on additional indebtedness, liens, various fundamental changes, dividends and distributions, investments (including acquisitions), transactions with affiliates, asset sales, prepayment of junior financing, changes in business and other limitations customary in senior secured credit facilities. In addition, the Company is required to maintain a Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement) of no more than 4.00 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter, which may, subject to certain limitations, be increased to 4.50 to 1.00 for four fiscal quarters subsequent to the Company completing an acquisition in excess of $500,000. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events and factors beyond our control. If we were to breach one or more covenants, the administrative agent with the consent of, or at the request of, the holders of more than 50% in principal amounts of the loans and commitments, may terminate the commitments and accelerate the maturity of the loans and enforce certain other remedies. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. While the agreements governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities generally restrict our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to important and significant exceptions and limitations. Also, these agreements generally do not prohibit us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as defined therein. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risks associated with our indebtedness described above could increase.

29

We depend on key and highly skilled personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional personnel, our ability to achieve our long-term strategic business and financial objectives and execute our business plan could be harmed, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results
.
Our success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers, managers and skilled personnel, including our development engineers. From time to time, including over the past year, we have experienced changes in our executive management team and other key personnel, which is disruptive to our business. Generally, our employees, including executive management are not bound by obligations that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. Moreover, our employees, including executive management are generally not subject to non-competition agreements. Given these limitations, we may not be able to continue to attract, retain and motivate the qualified personnel necessary for our business. In addition, we recruit from a limited pool of engineers with expertise in analog mixed-signal semiconductor design, and the competition for such personnel can be intense. Our future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our executive management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to locate suitable or qualified replacements could be significantly detrimental to our operations or product development efforts and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel, including certain foreign nationals who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents, many of whom are highly skilled and constitute an important part of our U.S. workforce, particularly in the areas of engineering and product development. Our ability to hire and retain these employees and their ability to remain and work in the U.S. are impacted by laws, regulations and policies as well as by procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies. Changes in immigration laws, regulations, policies or procedures may adversely affect our ability to hire or retain such workers, increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our ability to deliver our products and services, any of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business and operating results could be harmed as the result of undertaking restructuring activities.
We have initiated and implemented strategies to reduce costs, including workforce reductions and office closures, in the past two years, and incurred related restructuring costs in anticipation of realizing cost savings in the future. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements from the reductions of our workforce and other restructuring activities if our revenue and profits decline beyond our current projections. Any future restructuring would require substantial management time and attention and may divert management from other important work. If we are unable to effectively manage or efficiently implement these strategies and/or restructuring initiatives, we may not realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings of such strategies and initiatives, and our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected as a result.

30

Risks Related to our Information Technology, Intellectual Property, and Data Security and Privacy
If we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and inventions, our ability to compete successfully and our financial results could be adversely impacted.
We seek to protect our proprietary technology and inventions, particularly those relating to the design of our products, through the use of patents. As of March 28, 2025, we owned 1,942 active patents, including 966 U.S. patents (with expiration dates between 2025 and 2043), with an additional 487 pending patent applications, including 252 U.S. patent applications. Maintenance of patent portfolios, particularly outside of the U.S., is expensive, and the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and costly. While we intend to maintain our patents supporting our products and to continue to prosecute our currently pending patent applications and file future patent applications when appropriate, the value of these actions may not exceed their expense. Existing patents and those that may be issued from any pending or future applications may be subject to challenges, invalidation or circumvention, and the rights granted under our patents may not provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage. In addition, the protection afforded under the patent laws of one country may not be the same as that in other countries. This means, for example, that our right to exclusively commercialize a product in those countries where we have patent rights for that product can vary on a country-by-country basis. We also may not have the same scope of patent protection in every country where we do business. Additionally, it is difficult and costly to monitor the use of our intellectual property. It may be the case that our intellectual property is already being infringed, and infringement may occur in the future without our knowledge. The difficulty and failure to identify any violations of our intellectual property rights could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and result of operations and hurt our competitive advantage.
Additionally, we seek to protect our proprietary technology and inventions, particularly those relating to our manufacturing processes, as trade secrets. Under the trade secret laws of both the United States and applicable non-U.S. countries, protection of our proprietary information as trade secrets requires us to take steps to prevent unauthorized disclosure to third parties or misappropriation by third parties. While we require our officers, employees, consultants, distributors, and existing and prospective customers and collaborators to sign confidentiality agreements and take various security measures to protect unauthorized disclosure and misappropriation of our trade secrets, we cannot assure or predict that these measures will be sufficient. The semiconductor industry is generally subject to high employee turnover, so the risk of trade secret misappropriation may be amplified. If any of our trade secrets are subject to unauthorized disclosure or are otherwise misappropriated by third parties, our competitive position may be materially and adversely affected.

31

Our ability to compete successfully depends in part on our ability to commercialize our products without infringing the patent, trade secret or other intellectual property rights of others.
Our competitors and other third parties actively seek to protect their technology and inventions with patents and trade secrets. We have no means of knowing the content of patent applications filed by third parties until they are published. It is also difficult and costly to continuously monitor the intellectual property portfolios of our competitors to ensure our technologies do not violate the intellectual property rights of any third parties.
Patent assertion entities are common in the semiconductor industry, which is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, we receive communications from third parties that allege that our products or technologies infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights, and we may receive more or similar communications in the future. Lawsuits or other proceedings resulting from allegations of infringement could subject us to significant liability for damages, invalidate our proprietary rights and adversely affect our business. In the event that any third party succeeds in asserting a valid claim against us or any of our customers, we could be forced to do one or more of the following: discontinue selling, importing or using certain technologies that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could cause us to stop manufacturing certain products; seek to develop non-infringing technologies, which may not be feasible; incur significant legal expenses; pay substantial monetary damages to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing; and/or seek licenses for the infringed technology that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
If a third party causes us to discontinue the use of any of our technologies, we could be required to design around those technologies. This could be costly and time-consuming and could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Any significant impairments of our intellectual property rights from any litigation we face could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to compete in our industry.
Cybersecurity incidents that we or our critical third-party service providers experience could irreparably damage our reputation and business and materially affect our operating results and financial condition.
We rely on computer systems, hardware, software, technology infrastructure and online sites and networks for both internal and external operations (collectively, “IT Systems”) that are critical to our business. We own and manage some of these IT systems but also rely on third parties for a range of IT Systems and other products and services. In conducting our business, we also routinely collect and store sensitive data, including proprietary technology and information and personal information related to our business and our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as proprietary technology and information owned by our customers (collectively, “Confidential Information”). The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this Confidential Information is critical to our operations and business strategy.
We face numerous and evolving cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT Systems and Confidential Information. We and our third-party service providers are exposed to a range of cyberattack vectors, including computer viruses, malware (including ransomware), illegal hacking, criminal fraud or impersonation, acts of vandalism or terrorism, employee or contractor error or malfeasance, social engineering or phishing, or software-related errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities. Security measures that we, our third-party service providers, and our customers have implemented cannot detect or prevent all cybersecurity attacks, disruptions or security breaches. There can also be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our IT Systems and Confidential Information. Further, any integration of artificial intelligence in our or any third party’s operations, products or services is expected to pose new or unknown cybersecurity risks and challenges.

Threat actors are increasingly sophisticated and using techniques and tools that circumvent controls, evade detection, and remove forensic evidence, which means that effectively anticipating, containing and recovering from attacks and incidents in a timely manner is and will continue to be challenging, and may require us to incur material costs. Any attack, breach or misuse of Confidential Information, whether experienced by us or a third-party service provider or in our supply chain, could materially harm our reputation by deterring existing or prospective customers from using our products and applications, increasing our operating expenses in order to contain and remediate the incident, exposing us to unbudgeted or uninsured liability, disrupting our operations, diverting management focus away from other priorities, increasing our regulatory and litigation (including class action) exposure, and/or resulting in the imposition of material penalties and fines under state, federal and foreign laws. Any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. While we maintain various insurance policies, we cannot be certain that any or all cybersecurity or privacy-related losses or costs will be covered in whole or in part by our policies.

32

We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and consumer protection laws across different markets where we conduct our business. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.
In the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to various consumer protection, data privacy and information security laws and related regulations. These laws and regulations impose significant compliance requirements in relation to our IT Systems and Confidential Information, and in some instances, expose us to private rights of action and statutory damages for certain types of events. A serious breach of such laws or regulations may expose us to material litigation, fines, civil and/or criminal penalties, adverse publicity resulting in significant customer loss, and/or require us to change our business practices in a manner that materially impacts our financial condition. As a U.S.-based company operating in many countries around the world, we are subject not only to U.S. federal and varying U.S. state privacy, data protection, information security, and consumer protection laws and regulations, but also to numerous foreign laws and regulations, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China. Complying with these laws and regulations is costly and time-consuming, and as these laws and regulations are being interpreted broadly and in potentially conflicting ways by global regulators, we are subject to increased compliance obligations and regulatory scrutiny, litigation and reputational risks, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results. Additionally, restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of personal information or additional requirements and liability for security and data integrity could require us to modify our solutions and features, possibly in a material manner, and limit our ability to develop new products and features.
Risks Related to Regulatory Compliance
Our failure to comply with the large body of laws and regulations to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations
.
We are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations include: antitrust regulatory activities; consumer protection laws; artificial intelligence, data privacy and cybersecurity laws; import/export regulatory activities; product safety regulatory activities; worker health and safety; environmental protection; employment matters; and tax and other regulations in each of the areas in which we conduct business. In certain jurisdictions, regulatory requirements in one or more of these areas may be more stringent than or inconsistent with those of the United States, which could force us to incur greater compliance costs, while also exposing us to increased litigation or other risks. Any material increase in our costs as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In the area of employment matters, noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, fines, damages, penalties, or injunctions. In certain instances, former employees have brought claims against us, and we expect that we will encounter similar actions against us in the future. An adverse outcome in any such litigation could require us to pay damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. These enforcement actions could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees.
Our failure to comply with applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.
Anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in jurisdictions in which we do business generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These laws and regulations can be subject to varying interpretations and enforcement practices, increasing the risk of unintentional non-compliance. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, and we train our staff on anti-bribery laws and have established procedures and controls to monitor internal and external compliance. However, there can be no assurance that our internal controls and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents, nor do we have third-party attestation to the effectiveness of our internal controls related to fraud and corruption. There can be no guarantee that our efforts will prevent violations or allegations of violations, which could result in costly investigations, civil or criminal penalties, and reputational damage and which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.

In order to comply with environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, we may need to modify our activities or incur substantial costs, and such laws and regulations, including any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could subject us to substantial costs, liabilities, obligations and fines, or require us to have our suppliers alter their processes.
The semiconductor industry is subject to a variety of international, federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing pollution, environmental protection and occupational health and safety, including those relating to hazardous and toxic materials, product composition, and the investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites, including sites we currently or formerly owned or operated, due to the release of hazardous materials, regardless of whether we caused such release. In addition, we may be strictly liable for joint and several costs associated with investigation and remediation of sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes if such sites become contaminated, even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to significant fines or other civil or criminal costs, obligations, sanctions or property damage or personal injury claims, or suspension of our facilities’ operating permits. Compliance with current or future environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our business or require us to modify processes or incur other substantial expenses which could harm our business. In the event of an incident involving hazardous materials, we could be liable for damages, and such liability could exceed the amount of any liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business. In addition, in the event of the discovery of contaminants or the imposition of clean up obligations for which we are responsible, we may be required to take remedial or other measures which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In response to environmental concerns, some customers and government agencies impose requirements for the elimination and/or labeling of hazardous substances, such as lead (which is widely used in soldering connections in the process of semiconductor packaging and assembly), in electronic equipment, as well as requirements related to the take-back of products discarded by customers. For example, the EU adopted its RoHS, which prohibits, with specified exceptions, the sale in the EU market of electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead or other hazardous materials, and China has enacted similar regulations. Globally, environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations have tended to become more stringent over time, causing a need to redesign technologies, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could seriously harm our business.
General Risks
We could be subject to changes in tax rates or the adoption of new tax legislation, whether in or out of the United States, or could otherwise have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
As a multinational business, we are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Changes to tax laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws or regulations, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and reduce our cash flow from operating activities, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. For example, in October 2021, a global consortium of countries agreed to establish a new framework for international tax reform, including a new global minimum tax of 15% (“Pillar Two Minimum Tax”). In December 2022, European Union member states voted unanimously to implement rules for the Pillar Two Minimum Tax and gave member states until December 31, 2023 to implement such rules into national legislation. Many member states have enacted minimum tax legislation and others, including non-EU members, are considering law changes in the near term. In general, if a jurisdiction has an ETR below the 15%, the Pillar Two Minimum Tax may impute an additional alternative minimum “top-up tax.” The Company is subject to the Pillar Two Minimum Tax rules. If Pillar Two proposals are enacted into law in the U.S. or other countries in which we operate, it is possible that such proposals could increase our tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes in the future. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) considers the Pillar Two Minimum Tax an alternative minimum tax; therefore, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized or adjusted for any estimated future effects. In addition, other factors or events, including business combinations and investment transactions, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, adjustments to taxes upon finalization of various tax returns or as a result of deficiencies asserted by taxing authorities, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in available tax credits, changes in transfer pricing methodologies, other changes in the apportionment of our income and other activities among tax jurisdictions, and changes in tax rates, could also increase our ETR and/or valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. We exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the proper tax treatment is uncertain. We may also be liable for taxes in connection with businesses we acquire. Our determinations are not binding on the IRS or any other taxing authorities, and accordingly the final determination in an audit or other proceeding may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our tax provisions, accruals and returns. An assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

34

Failure to comply with requirements to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.
We have significant requirements for financial reporting and internal controls. If we are unable to maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations on a timely basis, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”), to furnish a report by our management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation and testing. Testing and maintaining internal controls may divert our management’s attention from other matters that are important to our business. In addition, pursuant to Section 404, we are required to include in the annual reports that we file with the SEC an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm, and the costs and burdens of complying with Section 404 could be significant.
Sustained inflation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
Inflation rates in the markets in which we operate have remained elevated, and this may continue in the future or inflation rates may increase. Inflation has caused and may continue to cause us to experience higher costs, including higher labor costs, wafer and other costs for materials from suppliers, and transportation and energy costs. In response to inflation, our suppliers have raised their prices and may continue to raise prices, and in the competitive markets in which we operate, and we may not be able to make corresponding price increases to preserve our gross margins and profitability. If inflation rates remain elevated or rise for a sustained period of time, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
Climate change presents risks that could disrupt our business operations and force us to incur increased costs and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
Our business and operations are highly dependent on our ability to utilize key physical locations for the design, manufacture, assembly and testing of our products, particularly our AMPI Facility and the facilities utilized by our third-party wafer fabrication partners. Natural disasters and severe weather events could damage our or our suppliers’ facilities or interrupt operations at or transportation to and from these facilities, which could result in delays in our ability to sell our products that would negatively impact our net sales, potentially damage our customer relationships and our reputation, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, natural disasters and severe weather events in the markets in which we operate, as well as various chronic climatic changes, could cause economic hardships and a reduction in the demand for our products.
We are subject to a series of risks related to ESG matters.
There is increased scrutiny from various stakeholders regarding companies’ management of climate change, human capital, and various other ESG matters. We engage in various initiatives (such as disclosures, policies, and targets) to manage such matters and address stakeholder expectations; however, such initiatives can be costly and may not have the desired effect. For example, many of our initiatives leverage methodologies, standards, and data that are complex and continue to evolve, including being subject to factors that in instances are outside of our control. As with other companies, our approach to such matters also evolves, and we cannot guarantee that our approach will align with the expectations or preferences of any particular stakeholder. Moreover, various stakeholders have different, and at times conflicting, expectations. For example, evolving environmental, climate, and other ESG-related laws and regulations across the United States and other jurisdictions do not fully align and may be inconsistent in their application and interpretation, which could increase the complexity and costs of compliance as well as any associated litigation or enforcement risks. Certain jurisdictions have also sought to constrain companies’ consideration of such matters. Both proponents and opponents of such matters are increasingly resorting to activism, including litigation, to advance their perspectives. Addressing stakeholder expectations and regulatory requirements entails costs, and any failure to successfully navigate such matters may result in reputational harm, loss of customers or contracts, regulatory or investor engagement, or other adverse impacts to our business. Many of our customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders are subject to similar expectations, which may augment or create additional risks.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity.
Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy
We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information.

Our cybersecurity risk management program is 
integrated
 into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas.
Key elements of our cybersecurity risk management program include:
•
risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems and information;
•
a formal IT risk register documenting and mitigating identified risks, reviewed by management on a quarterly basis;
•
a security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents;
•
the regular use of 
external service providers
 to independently assess and test security posture, as well as to otherwise assist with aspects of our security processes on an as needed basis;
•
cybersecurity awareness training of our employees, including incident response personnel and senior management;
•
a written cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; 
•
periodic tabletop exercises conducted by outside counsel to evaluate our incident response plan and response capabilities; and
•
a third-party risk management process for key service providers based on our assessment of their criticality to our operations and respective risk profile. 
We have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, which have materially affected us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. We face risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Information Technology, Intellectual Property, and Data Security and Privacy.”

Cybersecurity Governance
Our Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee (the “Committee”) oversight of risk assessment and risk management, including cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Committee oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program.

The Committee receives periodic reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the Committee, where it deems appropriate, regarding cybersecurity incidents it considers to be significant or potentially significant.
 These presentations may cover a range of topics, including:
•
the current cybersecurity landscape and emerging threats;
•
progress on cybersecurity projects; 
•
incident reports; 
•
lessons learned from past events; and
•
adherence to regulatory requirements and/or industry standards, as appropriate.
The Committee reports to the full Board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. The full Board also periodically receives briefings from management on our cyber risk management program. Board members receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our Chief Digital and Information Officer.
Our management team, including our 
Chief Digital and Information Officer and General Counsel
, is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Chief Digital and Information Officer has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants.

Our Chief Digital and Information Officer has more than 30 years of experience in information technology, including prior experience in cybersecurity architecture. We have an information security team with varying backgrounds, years of experience and levels of information security certification. 
Our management team takes steps to 
stay informed about and monitor efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel, threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us, and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in our IT environment.
