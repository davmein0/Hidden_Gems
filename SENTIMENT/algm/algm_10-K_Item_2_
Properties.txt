We also lease design and applications support centers in the Americas, Asia and Europe. Our decision to open and maintain additional design centers is based on several factors, including the ability to employ talented engineers at efficient costs and to better serve our local customer base.
Our manufacturing strategy consists of a combined internal and external sourcing strategy. This strategy enhances security of supply by providing both internal and external capacity throughout the manufacturing process and has enabled us to reduce our capital requirements, reduce our fixed costs, obtain additional capacity to meet customer needs in periods of high demand and establish wafer process technology collaborations.
We have a fabless business model that provides us with enhanced security of supply and manufacturing flexibility. Our primary fab partners currently include UMC, PSL, Tower and TSMC. We have master service agreements with all primary foundry partners, and we have also engaged in long-term supply agreements with some of our foundry partners.
The AMPI Facility is our primary internal assembly and testing facility for our sensor and power products, with packaging capabilities and quality standards that meet stringent automotive safety and reliability specification requirements. We also supplement the assembly capabilities of the AMPI Facility with subcontractors throughout Asia, and approximately 45%, 47% and 51% of our assembly was outsourced in fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
While our principal test operations are performed at the AMPI Facility, additional test capabilities are available at our Manchester, New Hampshire facility, and a small portion of testing is outsourced.
We are committed to manufacturing products of the highest quality and performance. We strive to have a “zero-defect” quality culture focused on meeting or exceeding demanding high-temperature automotive quality standards. We strive to comply with industry standards such as IATF 16949:2016 (the automotive sector-specific quality management system standard) and ISO 14001 (a voluntary standard for environmental management published by the International Standards Organization), and we also strive to comply with ISO 26262 ASIL product development standards, RoHS and similar environmental product requirements. Leading global automotive, industrial, and consumer manufacturers regularly audit our facilities for compliance with these standards, as well as with their own customer-specific standards.

Overview
Allegro MicroSystems, Inc. is a leading global designer, developer, fabless manufacturer and marketer of sensor ICs and application-specific power ICs enabling the most important emerging technologies in the automotive and industrial markets. With the broadest portfolio of magnetic sensor IC solutions available, and underpinned by our strong position in the automotive market, we are the leading magnetic sensor supplier worldwide based on market share. Our products are foundational to automotive and industrial electronic systems. Our sensor ICs enable our customers to precisely measure motion, speed, position and current, while our power ICs include high-temperature and high-voltage capable motor drivers, power management ICs, LED driver ICs and isolated gate drivers. We believe that our technology expertise, combined with our deep applications knowledge and strong customer relationships, enable us to develop solutions that provide more value to customers than typical ICs. Compared to a typical IC, our solutions are more integrated, intelligent and sophisticated for complex applications and easier for customers to use.
We are headquartered in Manchester, New Hampshire and have a global footprint with 29 locations across four continents. Our portfolio includes more than 1,500 products, and we ship approximately 1.5 billion units annually to more than 10,000 customers worldwide. During fiscal years 2025 and 2024, we generated $725.0 million and $1,049.4 million in total net sales, respectively, with $72.8 million in net loss, and $152.9 million in net income, respectively.
Recent Initiatives to Improve Results of Operations
We implemented several initiatives during fiscal years 2024 and 2025 that were designed to improve our operating results during those fiscal years and going forward.
We continue our efforts to leverage our fixed costs and operating margin improvements. Efficiencies may be achieved through cost structure improvements, streamlining of manufacturing and support processes, and further utilization of excess capacity. These manufacturing efficiencies may allow us to leverage higher volumes when demand increases across most of our applications, which would increase the absorption of our fixed costs. Although these initiatives can result in gross margin and operating income improvements, we cannot ensure that these trends will occur or continue over the long-term.
On August 7, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Allegro MicroSystems, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“AML”), Silicon Structures LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of AML (“Merger Sub”), Crocus, and NanoDimension Management Limited, as the representative of the Crocus shareholders. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, on October 31, 2023, Merger Sub merged with and into Crocus, with Crocus continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of AML (the “Transaction”). Crocus was subsequently merged into Allegro MicroSystems France SAS, a wholly owned subsidiary of AML, with Allegro MicroSystems France SAS continuing as the surviving corporation. The aggregate purchase price paid by the Company was $411.8 million in cash.

 On October 31, 2023, we entered into a $250.0 million term loan maturing in 2030 (the “2023 Term Loan Facility”), the proceeds of which were used to repay all outstanding term loans under our prior term loan agreement dated September 30, 2020, with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent, collateral agent, and the other agents, arrangers and lenders parties thereto and to finance, in part, the Transaction. The 2023 Term Loan Facility was executed as an incremental amendment to the revolving facility credit agreement dated June 21, 2023 (the “2023 Revolving Credit Agreement”) with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, collateral agent, a letter of credit issuer and a lender, and the other agents, lenders and letter of credit issuers parties thereto. The 2023 Term Loan Facility amortized at a rate of 0.25% per quarter, and the initial margin applicable to the 2023 Term Loan Facility was 2.75% for term SOFR-based loans and 1.75% for base rate loans.
In February 2024, we initiated a realignment of resources associated with our photonics and advanced 3D imaging solutions business to refocus spending on other technologies. As a result of the change in strategy, we recorded impairment charges of $11.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 related to intangible, and long-lived assets from our 2021 acquisition of Voxtel, Inc.
On July 23, 2024, we entered into a share repurchase agreement with Sanken (the “Share Repurchase Agreement”) pursuant to which we agreed to repurchase 38,767,315 shares of our common stock from Sanken in a privately negotiated transaction at a price per share equal to the price per share at which the underwriters in a public underwritten equity offering of shares of our common stock would purchase the shares (the “Equity Offering”). The repurchase of shares of common stock occurred in two separate closings, with the first closing taking place after the closing of the Equity Offering (the “First Closing”) and the second closing (the “Second Closing”) occurring after the receipt of the proceeds from borrowings under the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility (as defined below). The First Closing of the share repurchase was conditioned upon the closing of the Equity Offering and certain other conditions, and the Second Closing of the share repurchase was conditioned upon the receipt of net proceeds of no less than $300.0 million from incremental term loans under the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Repurchase Agreement, Sanken reimbursed us for the expenses incurred by us in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Share Repurchase Agreement, and paid a facilitation fee of $35.0 million, which was recorded within additional paid-in-capital with the consolidated statements of changes in equity.
To fund the First Closing, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Barclays Capital Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters (the “Underwriters”), on July 24, 2024, pursuant to which we agreed to sell 25,000,000 shares of our common stock, to the Underwriters at a price of $23.16 per share. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, we granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,750,000 shares of our common stock at the same purchase price, which option was exercised in full prior to the closing of the Equity Offering.
On July 26, 2024, we completed the Equity Offering pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement of 28,750,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $24.00 per share resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately $665.9 million, after deducting $24.2 million of underwriting discounts. As described above, we used the net proceeds of the Equity Offering to complete the First Closing under the Share Repurchase Agreement.
On July 29, 2024, we completed the First Closing under the Share Repurchase Agreement, repurchasing 28,750,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate consideration of $628.3 million, which was the Equity Offering price, less the facilitation fee of $35.0 million, underwriting discounts, and reimbursable transaction expenses. The shares repurchased in the First Closing were retired.
On August 6, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “Second Amendment”) to the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment increased the total capacity of the revolving credit facility thereunder to $256.0 million.
The Second Amendment also provided for a new $400.0 million tranche of term loans maturing in 2030 (the “Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility”), the proceeds of which were primarily used to (i) repurchase a portion of our common stock in connection with the Second Closing, (ii) refinance the 2023 Term Loan Facility (as defined in Note 13, “Debt and Other Borrowings” to the audited consolidated financial statements), (iii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing and (iv) for general corporate purposes. The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility amortized at a rate of 1.00% per annum. The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility bore interest, at our option, at a rate equal to (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended) in effect from time to time plus 2.25% or (ii) the highest of (x) the Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.50%, (y) the prime lending rate or (z) the one-month Term SOFR plus 1.0% in effect from time to time plus 1.25%. In conjunction with this refinancing, we recognized $3.6 million as a debt discount, which will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term using the effective interest method.

A payment of $25.0 million was applied to the term loan balance on October 31, 2024, which eliminated future required minimum quarterly payments.

42

On August 7, 2024, we completed the Second Closing under the Share Repurchase Agreement, repurchasing 10,017,315 shares of our common stock for aggregate cash consideration of $225.5 million, which was the Equity Offering price, less underwriting discounts and reimbursable transaction expenses. As described above, we used a portion of the proceeds from the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility and existing cash on hand to complete the Second Closing. The shares repurchased in the Second Closing were retired.
The Share Repurchase Agreement was accounted for as a forward repurchase contract as there were certain terms that could have caused the obligation not to be fulfilled. Accordingly, the contract was initially recorded as a liability at its fair value with subsequent remeasurements recognized in loss on change in fair value of forward repurchase contract until the completion of the First Closing and Second Closing. We recognized a loss of $34.8 million as a result of the fair value forward repurchase contract in the consolidated statements of operations.
In connection with the Share Repurchase Agreement, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement with Sanken (the “Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement”), which amended and restated the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated as of June 16, 2022, by and among us, Sanken and OEP SKNA, L.P. (“OEP”). The Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, which became effective in accordance with its terms on July 29, 2024, removed OEP as a party and amended certain rights and obligations of us and Sanken.
On September 20, 2024, we, along with Sanken, PSL, and PS Investment Aggregator, L.P. (“Subscriber”), completed the transaction (the “PSL Closing”) contemplated by a Sale and Subscription Agreement that we, Sanken, PSL and Subscriber entered into on April 25, 2024 (the “PSL Agreement” and the transaction thereunder, the “PSL Transaction”). As contemplated by the PSL Agreement, Subscriber and certain of its affiliates agreed to make capital contributions to PSL of $175.0 million in exchange for an equity interest in PSL, and we agreed to discharge the PSL Promissory Notes (as defined in Note 21, “Related Party Transactions” to the audited consolidated financial statements) held by us for a value of $10.4 million in exchange for PSL equity interests. Following the PSL Closing, we owned approximately 10.2% of PSL. As a result of PSL's share issuance to Subscriber, we recognized a net loss of $2.8 million related to the difference between the selling price per share and its carrying amount per share and after a gain from the conversion of the PSL Promissory Notes. The loss is included in Other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
At the PSL Closing, we, Sanken and Subscriber entered into an amended and restated limited partnership agreement (the “Limited Partnership Agreement”) with Polar Semiconductor GP I, LLC. The Limited Partnership Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this type, the reimbursement of expenses and costs, and restrictions on transfers. Also as contemplated by the Agreement and effective upon the PSL Closing, we, Sanken and Subscriber contributed our equity interests in PSL in exchange for limited partnership interests of a newly formed Delaware limited partnership that is the ultimate parent indirectly holding all of Polar’s issued and outstanding equity units (“PSL Parent”). Immediately following the Closing and associated completion of the recapitalization and reorganization transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the Company’s ownership of PSL Parent was approximately 10.2%.
On February 6, 2025 we entered into Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”) to the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment provides for a new $375.0 million tranche of term loans maturing in 2030 (the “2025 Refinanced Loans”), the proceeds of which were used, in relevant part, to (i) refinance all outstanding borrowings under the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility, (ii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing and (iii) for general corporate purposes. The 2025 Refinanced Loans amortize at a rate of 0.00% per annum. The 2025 Refinanced Loans bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate equal to (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended) in effect from time to time plus 2.00% or (ii) the highest of (x) the Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.50%, (y) the prime lending rate or (z) the one-month Term SOFR plus 1.00% in effect from time to time plus 1.00%. The 2025 Refinanced Loans will mature on October 31, 2030. In conjunction with this financing, we incurred $1.1 million in costs. Borrowings under the 2025 Refinanced Loans are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. A payment of $30.0 million and $25.0 million was applied to the outstanding balance of the 2025 Refinanced Loans on February 28, 2025 and April 30, 2025, respectively.
In January 2025, we enacted a global restructuring plan that included a rebalancing of our workforce and consolidation of leased facilities in an effort to optimize our cost structure. In connection with the restructuring plan, we incurred costs related to severance, annual incentive program and other employee-related benefits, retention incentives, accelerated amortization of right-of-use for certain leases, as well as various professional service charges. The restructuring is expected to be substantially completed during fiscal year 2026.

Other Key Factors and Trends Affecting our Operating Results
Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by numerous other factors and trends, including the following:
Inflation
Although inflation has moderated in recent periods, inflation rates in the markets in which we operate have increased and may continue to rise as a result of cost increases attributable to global tariff policies. Inflation in recent quarters has led us to experience higher costs, including higher labor costs, wafer and other costs for materials from suppliers, and transportation and energy costs. Our suppliers have raised their prices and may continue to raise prices, and in the competitive markets in which we operate, we may not be able to make corresponding price increases to preserve our gross margins and profitability. If inflation rates continue to rise or remain elevated for a sustained period of time, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. While we have attempted to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as adjusting our selling prices and releasing new products with improved gross margins, our ability to increase our average selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs.
Design Wins with New and Existing Customers
Our end customers continually develop new products in existing and new application areas, and we work closely with our significant OEM customers in most of our target markets to understand their product roadmaps and strategies. For new products, the time from design initiation and manufacturing until we generate sales can be lengthy, typically between two and four years. As a result, our future sales are highly dependent on our continued success at winning design mandates from our customers. Further, despite current inflationary and pricing conditions, we expect the ASPs of our products to decline over time, and we consider design wins to be critical to our future success as they help mitigate declines in ASPs. We anticipate being increasingly dependent on revenue from newer design wins for our newer products. The selection process is typically lengthy and may require us to incur significant design and development expenditures in pursuit of a design win, with no assurance that our solutions will be selected. As a result, the loss of any key design win or any significant delay in the ramp-up of volume production of a customer’s products into which our product is designed could adversely affect our business. In addition, volume production is contingent upon the successful introduction and market acceptance of our customers’ end products, which may be affected by several factors beyond our control.
Customer Demand, Orders and Forecasts
Demand for our products is highly dependent on market conditions in the end markets in which our customers operate, which are generally subject to seasonality, cyclicality, tariffs and other pricing increases and competitive conditions. In addition, a substantial portion of our total net sales is derived from sales to customers that purchase large volumes of our products. These customers generally provide periodic forecasts of their requirements. However, these forecasts do not commit such customers to minimum purchases, and customers can revise these forecasts without penalty. In addition, as is customary in the semiconductor industry, customers are generally permitted to cancel orders for our products within a specified period. Cancellations of orders could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses. In addition, changes in forecasts or the timing of orders from customers expose us to the risks of inventory shortages or excess inventory. We are currently operating in an inflationary environment for our products as a result of global tariff policies, which also have the potential to reduce end market demand in certain markets. Over the past several quarters, we and other semiconductor companies have experienced a downturn in market demand, primarily driven by softening demand from customers across various markets and digestion of excess accumulated inventory. In addition, factors that cause a reduction in the demand from end users of our OEMs’ or other customers’ products, including as a result of increased prices resulting from global trade policies, tariffs or a recessionary environment in the markets in which we operate, may in the future continue to cause our direct customers to significantly reduce the number of products ordered from us.

44

Manufacturing Costs and Product Mix
Gross margin has been, and will continue to be, affected by a variety of factors, including the ASPs of our products, product mix in a given period, material costs, yields, manufacturing costs and efficiencies. We believe the primary driver of gross margin is the ASP negotiated between us and our customers relative to material costs and yields. Our pricing and margins depend on the volumes and the features of the products we produce and sell to our customers. As our products mature and unit volumes increase, we expect their ASPs to decline in the long term. We continually monitor and work to reduce the cost of our products and improve the potential value our solutions provide to our customers, as we target new design win opportunities and manage the product life cycles of our existing customer designs. We also maintain a close relationship with our suppliers and subcontractors to improve quality, increase yields and lower manufacturing costs. As a result, these declines often coincide with improvements in manufacturing yields and lower wafer, assembly, and testing costs, which offset some or all of the margin reduction that results from declining ASPs. However, we expect our gross margin to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of changes in ASPs due to product mix, new product introductions, transitions into volume manufacturing and manufacturing costs. Gross margin generally decreases if production volumes are lower as a result of decreased demand as it did throughout fiscal year 2025, which leads to a reduced absorption of our fixed manufacturing costs. Gross margin generally increases when the opposite occurs.
Cyclical Nature of the Semiconductor Industry
The semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and is characterized by increasingly rapid technological change, product obsolescence, competitive pricing pressures, evolving standards, short product life cycles in consumer and other rapidly changing markets and fluctuations in product supply and demand. New technology may result in sudden changes in system designs or platform changes that may render some of our products obsolete and require us to devote significant research and development resources to compete effectively. Periods of rapid growth and capacity

expansion are occasionally followed by significant market corrections in which sales decline, inventories accumulate, and facilities go underutilized. During periods of expansion, our margins generally improve as fixed costs are spread over higher manufacturing volumes and unit sales. In addition, we may build inventory to meet increasing market demand for our products during these times, which serves to absorb fixed costs further and increase our gross margins. During an expansion cycle, we may increase capital spending and hiring to add to our production capacity. During periods of slower growth or industry contractions, our sales, production and productivity and margins generally decline.

Components of Our Results of Operations
Net sales
Our total net sales are primarily derived from product sales to direct customers and distributors. We sell products globally through our direct sales force, third-party and related party distributors and independent sales representatives. Sales are derived from products for different applications. Our core applications are focused on the automotive, industrial and other industries.
We sell magnetic sensor ICs and power ICs in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Net sales are generally recognized when control of the products is transferred to the customer, which typically occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the contract. When we transact with a distributor, our contractual arrangement is with the distributor and not with the end customer. Whether we transact business with and receive the order from a distributor or directly from an end customer through our direct sales force and independent sales representatives, our revenue recognition policy and resulting pattern of revenue recognition for the order are the same. We recognize revenue net of sales returns, price protection adjustments, stock rotation rights and any other discounts or credits offered to our customers.
Cost of goods sold, gross profit and gross margin
Cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs of purchasing raw materials, costs associated with probe, assembly, test and shipping our products, costs of personnel, including stock-based compensation, costs of equipment associated with manufacturing, procurement, planning and management of these processes, costs of depreciation and amortization, costs of logistics and quality assurance, and costs of royalties, value-added taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance of equipment, and an allocated portion of our facility occupancy costs.
Gross profit is calculated as total net sales less cost of goods sold, and gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by net sales. Gross profit is affected by numerous factors, including average selling price, revenue mix by product, channel and customer, foreign exchange rates, seasonality, manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our facilities. Another factor impacting gross profit is the time required for the expansion of existing facilities to reach full production capacity. As a result, gross profit varies from period to period and year to year.
A significant portion of our costs are fixed, and as a result, costs are generally difficult to adjust or may take time to adjust in response to changes in demand. In addition, our fixed costs increase as we expand our capacity. If we expand capacity faster than required by our sales growth, our gross margin could be negatively affected.

45

Operating Expenses
Research and development (“R&D”) expenses
R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs of our research and development organization, including stock-based compensation, costs of development of wafers and masks, license fees for computer-aided design software, costs of development testing and evaluation, costs of developing automated test programs, equipment depreciation and related occupancy and equipment costs. While most of the costs incurred are for new product development, a significant portion of these costs are related to process technology development, and proprietary package development. R&D expenses also include costs for technology development by external parties. We expect further increases in R&D expenses, in absolute dollars, as we continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new product offerings, as well as increase the headcount of our R&D personnel in future years.
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses
SG&A expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, and sales commissions to independent sales representatives, professional fees, including the costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax compliance. Additionally, costs related to advertising, trade shows, corporate marketing, as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs, also comprise SG&A expenses.
We anticipate our selling and marketing expenses will increase in absolute terms as we expand our sales force and increase our sales and marketing activities.
Impairment of long-lived assets
Impairment of long-lived assets consists primarily of impairment charges related to intangibles assets and other long-lived assets when factors exist that indicate the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable.
Interest expense
Interest expense is from term loan debt and credit facilities that we maintain with various financial institutions.
Interest income
Interest income is earned on our cash and cash equivalents, consisting primarily of certain investments that have contractual maturities no greater than three months at the time of purchase.
Foreign currency transaction (loss) gain
We incur transaction gains and losses resulting from intercompany transactions, as well as transactions with customers or vendors, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity in which the transaction is recorded.
Income (loss) in earnings of equity investment
Income (loss) in earnings of equity investment is related to our equity investment in PSL (PSL Parent following its recapitalization in September 2024).
Loss on change in fair value of forward repurchase contract
Loss on change in fair value of forward repurchase contract is due to the various settlement dates under the Share Repurchase Agreement.
Other (expense) income, net
Other (expense) income, net includes unrealized (loss) gains on marketable securities from changes in the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. These investments are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the entity’s stock price. Miscellaneous income and expense items unrelated to our core operations are also within other (expense) income, net.

46

Income tax (benefit) provision
Our provision for or benefit from income taxes is based on an estimate of the annual effective tax rate plus the tax impact of discrete items.
We are subject to tax in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate fluctuates primarily because of: the change in the mix of our U.S. and foreign income; the impact of discrete transactions and law changes; state tax impacts and the difference between the amount of tax benefits generated by the foreign derived intangible income (“FDII”) deduction, including permanent impacts of 174 Capitalization (as defined below), and research credits, offset by the additional tax costs associated with global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”), Subpart F income and non-deductible stock-based compensation charges.
Pursuant to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, U.S. tax law began requiring us to capitalize and amortize domestic and foreign research and development expenditures over five and 15 years, for domestic and foreign research, respectively (“174 Capitalization”).

We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes that could result from the examination of our tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our income tax reserves and expense. Should actual events or results differ from our then-current expectations, charges or credits to our provision for income taxes may become necessary. Any such adjustments could have a significant effect on our results of operations.

Our total net sales and cost of goods sold for the periods presented above include related party net sales generated through our distribution agreement with Sanken and costs of goods sold related thereto. See our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our related party net sales and cost of goods sold for the periods set forth above.

Total net sales
Total net sales decreased in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by an overall reduction in customer-held inventory resulting in a decline in shipments across all end markets. The decline in shipments impacted all applications including e-Mobility products, safety comfort and convenience applications, ICE, and broad-based and other industrial applications, including data center applications, clean energy and automation, and consumer and smart home products.

The decrease in MS was due to a decline in fiscal year 2025 demand for our current and isolator products, as well as our magnetic speed and position sensors, partially offset by an increase in sales of our TMR solutions. The decline in PIC sales was primarily driven by a decrease in fiscal year 2025 demand for our motor products and high-performance power products. For additional details on the factors driving the decrease in demand for fiscal year 2025, see discussion below under Net Sales by Geographic Location.

In Greater China, net sales decreased primarily due to the decline in automotive markets, partially offset by an increase in broad-based industrial applications, which are served through distributors who are currently managing inventory levels. Americas net sales decreased primarily due to the decline in the United States automotive and industrial markets across primarily all applications. In addition, Europe net sales declined in primarily all automotive and industrial, where demand in broad-based and other industrial applications has declined along with demand for electric vehicles. South Korea net sales declined in all automotive applications, primarily driven by safety, comfort and convenience applications, along with declines in most industrial applications. Other Asia net sales declined across most industrial and auto markets partially offset by an increase in broad-based applications. Japan net sales declined across all auto applications primarily driven by safety, comfort and convenience applications, partially offset by an increase in broad-based applications.
Cost of goods sold, gross profit and gross margin
Cost of goods sold decreased in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to a reduction in shipped volume, as well as a change in product mix, partially offset by an increase in amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Crocus.
Gross profit decreased in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024 due to the decrease in net sales and a change in product mix as discussed above.
Gross margin was 44.3% and 54.8% for the fiscal years ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the decline in net sales and a change in product mix, noted above.

49

R&D expenses
R&D expenses increased in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024. This increase was primarily due to an increase in R&D supplies, partially offset by a reduction from personnel costs, depreciation and R&D tax credits.
R&D expenses represented 24.8% of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025, an increase from 16.8% of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the increase in R&D supplies in addition to the decline in net sales, partially offset by a reduction from personnel costs, outside service costs, depreciation and R&D tax credits.
SG&A expenses
SG&A expenses decreased in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in funding of the Company’s annual incentive bonus program and outside service costs, partially offset by an increase in personnel and severance expenses.
SG&A expenses represented 22.3% of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025, representing an increase from 18.0% of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024. The increase as a percentage of total net sales was primarily due to the decline in net sales, partially offset by a decrease in outside service costs, personnel and severance expenses, and the funding of the annual incentive program.
Impairment of long-lived assets
We recorded an impairment of long-lived assets of $13.2 million in the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024. The impairment was related to our decision to refocus resources away from our photonics and advanced 3D imaging solutions.
Interest expense
Interest expense increased in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher interest payments on the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility, which increased our total outstanding debt balance.

Interest income
Interest income decreased in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024, primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalent balances.
Foreign currency transaction (loss) gain
We recorded a foreign currency transaction loss in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025, compared to a gain in the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024. The foreign currency transaction loss recorded in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025 was primarily due to realized and unrealized losses from our Philippine locations. The foreign currency transaction gain recorded in the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024 was related to a transaction between the U.S. and French subsidiaries.
Income (loss) in earnings of equity investment
Income (loss) in earnings of equity investment reflected income of $1.2 million and loss of $0.5 million in the fiscal years ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, respectively, representing the earnings on our 30% investment in PSL (and approximately 10.2% investment in PSL Parent following PSL’s recapitalization in September 2024).
Loss on change in fair value of forward repurchase contract
We recorded a loss on the change in fair value of a forward repurchase contract in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025, primarily due to the various settlement dates under the Share Repurchase Agreement with Sanken.
Other (expense) income, net
We recorded a net loss of $2.8 million as a result of the PSL Closing in the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025 related to the difference between the selling price per share and its carrying amount per share and after a gain from the conversion of PSL Promissory Notes that we held, partially offset by $1.6 million of gains related to earnings in our money market fund deposits. We recorded $11.8 million of gains related to sales of our investment in marketable securities and earnings in our money market fund deposits, partially offset by unrealized losses of $11.2 million related to our investment in marketable securities in the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024.

Income tax (benefit) provision
For the fiscal years ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, our income tax (benefit) provision and the effective income tax rate (“ETR”) was $(12.9) million and 15.1%, and $41.9 million and 21.5%, respectively. The decrease in our ETR was primarily due to the decrease in GAAP income before tax and the impact of the entity restructuring transactions completed during the fiscal year ended March 29, 2024.

50

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of March 28, 2025, we had $121.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and $370.8 million of working capital, compared to $212.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $454.3 million of working capital as of March 29, 2024. Working capital is impacted by the timing and extent of our business needs.
Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital resources besides our growth initiatives, are working capital, capital expenditures, principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt, and other general corporate needs. Historically, these cash requirements have been met through cash provided by operating activities and cash and cash equivalents. Our current capital deployment strategy for fiscal year 2026 is to utilize cash on hand and capacity under our revolving credit facility to support our continued growth initiatives into select markets and planned capital expenditures, as well as consider potential acquisitions. As of March 28, 2025, the Company was not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. The cash requirements for the upcoming fiscal year relate to our operating leases, operating and capital purchase commitments, and expected contributions to our defined benefit and contribution plans. Additionally, we expect to continue to strategically invest in expanding our operations in China, Europe, Japan and India in order to directly manage and service our customers in these markets, which could result in increases in our total net sales, cost of goods sold and operating expenses. For information regarding the Company’s expected cash requirements and timing of payments related to leases and noncancellable purchase commitments, see Note 12, “Leases” and Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the audited consolidated financial statements. See Note 15, “Retirement Plans” to the audited consolidated financial statements for more information related to the Company’s pension and defined contribution plans. Additionally, refer to Note 13, “Debt and Other Borrowings” for information regarding the Company’s management of our third-party debt capacity.

We believe that our existing cash will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy, planned capital expenditures and the additional expenses that we expect to incur during the next 12 months. In order to support and achieve our future growth plans, we may need or advantageously seek to obtain additional funding through equity or debt financing. We believe that our current operating structure will facilitate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our expected long-term liquidity requirements beyond the next 12 months. If these resources are not sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements due to changes in circumstances, we may be required to borrow under our revolving credit facility or seek additional financing. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities that are not used to repurchase existing shares outstanding, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may contain covenants that significantly restrict our operations or our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future. Any additional financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us or our existing stockholders, or at all. See “Risk Factors —Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited and could prevent us from executing our growth strategy.” We have made advance payments on our borrowings, which has eliminated future minimum quarterly payments.

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $61.9 million in the fiscal year 2025, resulting primarily from a net loss of $72.8 million and non-cash charges of $143.5 million, further adjusted by a net decrease in cash from an increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $8.9 million. Noncash charges primarily include increases for $64.5 million of depreciation and amortization, $41.9 million of stock-based compensation, $34.8 million for loss on the change in fair value of a forward repurchase contract, $9.2 million provisions for inventory and expected credit losses and $7.0 million of other non-cash reconciling items, partially offset by $16.3 million of deferred income taxes. The net increase in operating assets and liabilities consisted of a $30.2 million increase in inventories, $16.3 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities and $4.8 increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, partially offset by a $33.1 million decrease in trade accounts receivable, net, a $4.0 million increase in trade accounts payable and a $5.1 million increase in net amounts due to related party. The decrease in trade accounts receivable, net was primarily a result of decreased sales year-over-year. Trade accounts payable increased primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers and vendors, including unpaid capital expenditures of $2.2 million. The increase in net amounts due to related party was primarily due to variations in the timing of such payments in the ordinary course of business. The increase in inventories was primarily the result of inventory builds of standard products to support anticipated sales growth. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets was mostly due to the timing of tax payments. The decrease in accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities was primarily the result of a reduction in accrued personnel costs due to the timing of payments pursuant to our annual incentive compensation plan.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $181.7 million in fiscal year 2024, resulting primarily from our net income of $152.9 million and non-cash charges of $122.9 million, partially offset by a net decrease in cash from an increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $94.1 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted of a $40.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a $15.8 million increase in inventories, and an $8.0 million increase in trade accounts receivable, net, partially offset by a $21.6 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities, a $12.7 million decrease in trade accounts payable, and a $5.2 million increase in net amounts due from related parties. The increase in inventories was primarily a result of raw materials purchases and inventory builds to support anticipated sales growth in 2024 and beyond. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to long-term deposits and timing of tax payments. The increase in trade accounts receivable, net was primarily a result of increased sales year-over-year, as well as the timing of receipts. The decreases in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities were primarily due to the timing of payments to suppliers and vendors, including unpaid capital expenditures of $4.2 million, and higher accrued personnel costs, professional fees, income taxes, and accrued operating expenses.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $40.8 million in fiscal year 2025, primarily consisting of purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Net cash used in investing activities was $516.7 million in fiscal year 2024, consisting of payments related to the acquisition of Crocus of $408.1 million and $124.8 million of purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $16.2 million of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $112.1 million in fiscal year 2025, consisting of $853.9 million used to repurchase our common stock, $105.0 million of payments on our indebtedness under the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement and $16.2 million of taxes related to the net settlement of equity awards, partially offset by the issuance of common stock of $665.9 million, net proceeds of $193.1 million from our financing activities under the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement, proceeds received in connection with the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and proceeds received related to the quarterly payment on the PSL Promissory Note (prior to being discharged).
Net cash provided by financing activities was $198.9 million in fiscal year 2024, consisting of $245.5 million of borrowing under the 2023 Term Loan Facility, net of deferred financing costs, proceeds received related to the quarterly payment from PSL on our related party loan and proceeds received in connection with the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by payments on the 2020 Term Loan Facility and 2023 Term Loan Facility, taxes related to the net settlement of equity awards, and payments of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility and 2023 Term Loan Facility.
Debt Obligations
See Note 13, “Debt and Other Borrowings” in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations, including our term loans and credit facilities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to the valuation of acquired intangible assets, impairment assessment and valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets, the net realizable value of inventory, income taxes, stock-based compensation, and sales allowances. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that the accounting policies described below require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Judgments or uncertainties affecting the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding these and our other significant accounting policies.
Sales Allowances
Sales allowances include sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. Such consideration primarily includes limited price protection provisions provided to distributors. We estimate potential future sales allowances based on historical data from prior sales adjustments. Historical experience can change over time. As a result, estimated sales allowances may differ significantly from amounts recorded in the current and historical periods. See Note 6, “Trade Accounts Receivable, Net” to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the change in sales allowances.
Goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
In testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Such qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, economic conditions, entity-specific financial performance and other events, such as changes in management, strategy and primary customer base. If based on our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is required. However, if we conclude otherwise, quantitative impairment testing is not required.
We assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. We also periodically reassess their continuing classification as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment exists if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. An impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded to reduce the carrying value to its fair value.
Other long-lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets consist of completed technologies, customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, and patents. We engage third-party valuation specialists to assist us with the initial measurement of the fair value of acquired intangible assets. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of other long-lived assets whenever events and changes in circumstances, such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the industry, indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. When indicators of impairment are present, the carrying values of the asset group are evaluated in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business. The net book value of the underlying asset is adjusted to fair value if the sum of the expected discounted cash flows is less than book value. Fair values are based on estimates of market prices and assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.

The impairment assessment of goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets involves significant estimates and assumptions, which may be unpredictable and inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions may include identification of reporting units and asset groups, long-term growth rates, profitability, estimated useful lives, comparable market multiples, and discount rates. Any changes in these assumptions could impact the result of the impairment assessment. Impairment assessments are performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. No impairments were identified for fiscal year 2025.
Item 7A. Quantitativ
e and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business, consisting primarily of interest rates risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents and our debt, foreign currency risk and the impact of inflation. We do not engage in speculative trading activities. The following analysis provides additional information regarding these risks.
Interest Rate Risk
Our investments have limited exposure to market risk. At March 28, 2025, we maintained a portfolio of cash and cash equivalents, consisting primarily of money market fund deposits. None of these investments have a maturity date in excess of one year. Certain interest rates are variable and fluctuate with current market conditions. Because of the short-term nature of these instruments, we would not expect a sudden change in market interest rates to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
We are also exposed to market risk as a result of increases or decreases in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our 2025 Refinanced Loans and borrowings on our bank credit facilities. Although our 2025 Refinanced Loans and credit facilities have variable rates, as of March 28, 2025, we do not believe that a 10% change in market interest rates would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Foreign Currency Risk
Due to our international operations, a significant portion of our cost of sales and operating expenses is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the Euro and the Philippine peso. As a result, our international operations give rise to transactional market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and the Philippine peso. We reflected foreign exchange losses of $2.2 million and foreign exchange gains of $5.1 million for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Based on fiscal year 2025 performance, a hypothetical appreciation (decline) in the value of the Euro in relation to the U.S. dollar of 10% would favorably (negatively) impact operating income by immaterial amounts. A hypothetical 10% appreciation (decline) in the value of the Philippine peso in relation to the U.S. dollar would negatively (favorably) impact operating income by immaterial amounts. The individual impacts to our operating income of hypothetical currency fluctuations have been calculated in isolation from any potential responses to address such exchange rate changes in our foreign markets.
In addition, we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk for those subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, as changes in the value of their functional currency relative to the U.S. dollar can adversely affect the translated amounts of our sales, expenses, net income, assets and liabilities. This can, in turn, affect the reported value and relative growth of sales and net income from one period to the next. In addition, changes in the translated value of assets and liabilities due to changes in functional currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar result in foreign currency translation adjustments that are a component of other comprehensive income or loss. Foreign currency derivative instruments can be used to hedge exposures and reduce the risks of certain foreign currency transactions; however, these instruments provide only limited protection and can carry significant cost. We have no foreign currency derivative instrument hedges as of March 28, 2025. We will continue to analyze our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future.
Impact of Inflation
Inflationary factors, such as increases in overhead costs or the costs of other core operating resources, may adversely affect our operating results. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we do not believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our historical results of operations and financial condition have been material. We cannot assure that future inflationary or other cost pressures will not have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition in the future.

Item 9A. Controls a
nd Procedures.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 28, 2025. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 28, 2025, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended March 28, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 28, 2025. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2025 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page F-2 of this Annual Report.

Report of Independent Registered

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Allegro MicroSystems, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Allegro MicroSystems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive (loss) income, of changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 28, 2025, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 28, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition – Sales Allowance
As described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, variable consideration, such as sales allowances, includes sales in which the amount of consideration that the Company will receive is unknown as of the end of the reporting period. Such consideration primarily includes limited price protection provisions provided to distributors, sales under agreements that allow rights of return, referred to as stock rotation, provided to distributors, discounts and credits provided to distributors and returns provisions offered to direct customers, which make up a portion of total net sales of $725.0 million for the year ended March 28, 2025. The liability for returns and sales allowances was $33.9 million as of March 28, 2025, of which a significant portion relates to a certain sales allowance program. Management estimates potential future returns, credits and sales allowances based on historical data from prior sales returns and credits issued and changes in product sales to customers.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - sales allowance is a critical audit matter are a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the sales allowance and the liability related to the sales allowance transactions.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to a certain sales allowance program, including controls over the sales allowance and the liability related to the sales allowance transactions. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness, accuracy, and occurrence of a sample of sales allowance and the liability related to the sales allowance transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, including invoices and invoice credits related to the sales allowance program, and customer arrangements or promotional practices, where applicable.

Nature of the Busine
ss and Basis of Presentation
Allegro MicroSystems, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is a leading global designer, developer, fabless manufacturer and marketer of sensing and power solutions for motion control and energy-efficient systems in automotive and industrial and other markets. The Company is incorporated under the laws of Delaware. The Company is headquartered in Manchester, New Hampshire and has a global footprint, with 
29
 locations across 
four
 continents.
The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
Financial Periods
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the last Friday in March. The Company’s 2025 fiscal year ended March 28, 2025 (“fiscal year 2025”) was a 52-week period, the 2024 fiscal year ended March 29, 2024 (“fiscal year 2024”) was a 52-week period, and 2023 fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 (“fiscal year 2023”) was a 53-week period.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those entities required to be consolidated under GAAP. Intercompany profits, transactions, and balances among the consolidated entities have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to the valuation of acquired intangible assets, impairment assessment and valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets, the net realizable value of inventory, income taxes, stock-based compensation, and sales allowances. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period amounts to conform to current-period reporting classifications.
Segment Information
As of March 28, 2025, the Company operates in 
one
 reportable segment, which involves the design, development, production and distribution of various integrated circuits in various markets worldwide. The Company has a single, company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than as discrete operating segments. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), who is the Company’s 
Chief Executive Officer
, measures financial performance as a single enterprise and not on a legal entity or end market basis. 
The CODM uses consolidated net income or loss, as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, as the profitability measure in making decisions. The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total assets. Throughout the year, the CODM allocates capital resources on a project-by-project basis across the Company’s entire asset base to maximize profitability without regard to a legal entity or end market basis.
 The Company operates in a number of countries throughout the world in a variety of product lines through its business unit structure.
Business Combinations

The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, at the date of each acquisition, the Company measures the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed and any remaining noncontrolling interests and allocates the consideration paid to all items measured. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired are based on valuations that use information and assumptions determined by management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions a market participant would use.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar. The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated from functional currency into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities, and the average exchange rate in effect during the period for net sales and expenses. The functional currency for the Company’s international subsidiaries is generally considered to be the local currency for each entity, and, accordingly, translation adjustments for these entities are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Non-Controlling Interests
The Company, through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, established an affiliated entity in the Philippines for the primary purpose of purchasing, selling, leasing, developing and otherwise managing real estate acquired by the Company in the Philippines. The Company owns 
40
% of the equity interest in this entity, and the remaining 
60
% is held in a trust for the benefit of its employee retirement fund. The portion of the results of operations of this entity is shown as net income attributable to the non-controlling interests in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023. Additionally, the cumulative portion of the results of operations of this entity along with the interest in the net assets is shown as a component of non-controlling interests in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents. At March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, the Company maintained investments in interest-bearing cash accounts. Because of the investments’ short term to maturity and the investments’ relative price insensitivity to changes in market interest rates, cost approximates fair value for these investments. As a result, there were 
no
 realized or unrealized gains or losses for the fiscal years ended March 28, 2025, March 29, 2024 and March 31, 2023. The Company has restricted cash, the use of which is restricted to the benefit of employees through a deferred compensation program.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Certain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under GAAP. Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (at exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, which are provided below:
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 — Observable inputs (other than Level 1 prices) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or examination.
The categorization of a financial instrument within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The Company’s cash equivalents and restricted cash are carried at fair values as determined according to the fair value hierarchy described above (see Note 5, “Fair Value Measurements”). The carrying value of accounts receivable, notes receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their respective fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The carrying value of outstanding borrowings under the line of credit agreements approximates fair value as it bears interest at a rate approximating a market interest rate.

Related party notes receivable are classified as held-for-investment based on management’s intent and ability to hold the loan for the foreseeable future or to maturity. Loans held-for-investment are carried at amortized cost and reduced by a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses, as necessary. The Company recognizes interest income on loans, including the amortization of discounts and premiums, loan fees paid and received, using the interest method. The interest method is applied on a loan-by-loan basis when collectability of the future payments is reasonably assured. Premiums and discounts are recognized as yield adjustments over the term of the related loans.
A detailed description of fair value measurement of the assets of the non-U.S. defined benefit plan is included in Note 15, “Retirement Plans.”
Trade Accounts Receivable, Net
A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional where only the passage of time is required before payment is due. Accounts receivables are presented net of a provision for expected credit losses, which is an estimate of amounts that may not be collectible and returns and sales allowances.

The provision for expected credit losses is our estimate of current expected credit losses (“CECL”) based on historical loss experience. The Company periodically performs detailed reviews to assess the adequacy of the allowance. The Company exercises judgment in estimating the timing, frequency and severity of losses. The Company uses an aging schedule method to estimate current expected credit losses based on days of delinquency, including information about past events and current economic conditions, as well as future forecasts of economic conditions. The Company’s accounts receivable is separated into two categories using a portfolio methodology to evaluate the allowance under the CECL impairment model based on sales categorization and similar credit quality and worthiness of the customers: original equipment manufacturers and distributors. The receivables in each category share similar risk characteristics. The Company increases the allowance for expected credit losses when the Company determines all or a portion of a receivable is uncollectible. The Company recognizes recoveries as a decrease to the allowance for expected credit losses. Adjustments to the allowance for expected credit losses are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
Sales allowances include sales in which the amount of consideration that the Company will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. Such consideration primarily includes limited price protection provisions provided to distributors. The Company estimates potential future sales allowances based on historical data from prior sales adjustments. Historical experience can change over time. As a result, estimated sales allowances may differ significantly from amounts recorded in the current and historical periods.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined using a standard costing system that approximates actual costs, based on a first-in, first-out method. Inventory costs include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. The Company records inventory provisions when conditions exist that suggest that inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand, is obsolete based upon expected future demand for products and market conditions, or quality-related rejections. These provisions are reported as a reduction to raw materials and supplies, work in process and finished goods. The Company regularly evaluates the ability to realize the value of inventory based on a combination of factors, including historical usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, and product end of life dates. Assumptions used in determining management’s estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect, in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future. Although the Company performs a detailed review of its forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of the Company’s inventory and reported operating results.
Property, Plant and Equipment, Net
Property, plant and equipment, net, including improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend useful life, are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company capitalizes interest on certain projects with long-term construction periods. Maintenance and repairs expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. 
Estimated useful lives of the respective property, plant and equipment assets are as follows:

Intangible assets, net
Intangible assets, net primarily consist of identified intangible assets related to completed acquisitions, as well as capitalized costs to acquire and defend patent and trademark-related awards. In addition, the Company holds technology, customer relationships, and non-compete agreements. The Company’s intangible assets are amortized using a method that approximates their economic benefit over their estimated useful lives ranging from 
three
 to 
15 years
.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangibles, such as patents, completed technologies, customer relationships and indefinite-lived intangible assets such as process technology and trademarks.
Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other finite-lived assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset group for recoverability, the Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset group to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset group are less than its carrying amount. If such assets are not impaired, but their useful lives have decreased, the remaining net book value is amortized over the revised useful life.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. The impairment test consists of a qualitative assessment to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform a quantitative impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If such events occur, a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value is performed. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has elected the first business day of the fourth quarter of its fiscal year as the annual impairment testing date.

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
In testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Such qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, economic conditions, entity-specific financial performance and other events, such as changes in management, strategy and primary customer base. If based on the Company’s qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, quantitative impairment testing is required. However, if the Company concludes otherwise, quantitative impairment testing is not required. The results of the Company’s qualitative goodwill impairment test performed on the first business day of the fourth quarter for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 did not indicate any impairments.

Leases
At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is a lease arrangement or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Leases with a term greater than 12 months are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets with a corresponding lease liability. The Company has elected not to recognize on the consolidated balance sheets leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are directly expensed as incurred. Leases are classified as either operating or finance depending on the specific terms of the arrangement.
The Company’s leases mainly consist of facilities, office equipment, and vehicles. The majority of leases are classified as operating leases. Certain lease agreements contain provisions for future rent increases. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise fixed payments and future rent increases tied to an index or rate. Future rent increases dependent on an index or rate are initially measured at the index or rate at the commencement date. The Company’s leases typically do not contain residual value guarantees.
At the commencement date, operating and finance lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. The lease term includes the non-cancelable period of the lease, plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor. The interest rate implicit in a lease contract is typically not readily determinable, therefore an incremental borrowing rate is used to calculate the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as prepayments, lease incentives received or initial direct costs paid.
Product Warranties
The Company provides warranties on its products to its customers, generally for one year from the date of shipment and in limited cases for longer periods. In the event of a failure of a product covered by these warranties, the Company must repair or replace the product or, if those remedies are insufficient, and at the discretion of the Company, provide a refund. In limited cases, the Company warrants its products to include significant liability beyond the cost of repairing or replacing the product or refunding the sales price of the product. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of the warranty reserve and adjusts the amount, as necessary. If there is a material increase in the rate of customer claims, or the Company’s estimates of probable losses relating to specifically identified warranty exposures are inaccurate, the Company may need to record a charge against future cost of goods sold. There were 
$
1,026
 and 
$
477
 accrued for warranty reserves as of March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, respectively.

Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized on contracts with customers when transfer of control to the customer occurs in exchange for an amount reflecting the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled. In order to achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following five step approach:
(1)
 Identify the contract with a customer 
— The Company considers customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master agreements, to be customer contracts. A contract exists when it is approved by both parties, each party’s rights and obligations are identified, payment terms are known, the customer has the ability and intent to pay and the contract has commercial substance. The Company uses judgment in determining the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on factors such as the customer’s historical payment experience or, for new customers, credit and financial information pertaining to the customers.
(2)
 Identify the performance obligations in the contract 
— Performance obligations are identified as products and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the products or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Substantially, all of the Company’s contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, such as the sale of mixed-signal integrated circuit products.
(3)
 Determine the transaction price 
— The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring products to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it is probable that no significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will occur.
(4)
 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 
— If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price.
(5)
 Recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied 
— Revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at a point in time at shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the contract.
Sales channels
The Company sells products globally through its direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and consignment. The Company records revenue based on the amount of any discounted arrangement fee. When the Company transacts with a distributor, its contractual arrangement is with the distributor and not with the end customer. Whether the Company transacts business with and receives the order from a distributor or directly from an end customer, its revenue recognition policy and resulting pattern of revenue recognition for the order are the same.
The Company also uses independent sales representatives to assist in the sales process with certain customers. Sales representatives are not distributors. If a sales representative is engaged in the sales process, the Company receives the order directly from and sells the products directly to the end customer. The Company pays a commission to the sales representative, calculated as a percentage of the related customer payment. Sales representatives’ commissions are recorded as expenses when incurred and are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.
For consignment arrangements with distributors, delivery occurs and revenue is recognized when the distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that is stored at designated distributor locations. Recognition is not contingent upon resale of the products to the distributors’ customers. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the distributor, the Company retains control over the products’ disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products.
Variable consideration
Variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that the Company will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. Such consideration primarily includes limited price protection provisions provided to distributors, sales under agreements that allow rights of return, referred to as stock rotation, provided to distributors, discounts and credits provided to distributors and returns provisions offered to direct customers. The Company estimates potential future returns, credits and sales allowances based on historical data from prior sales returns and credits issued and changes in product sales to customers.

Practical expedients elected
Revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount methodology. The length of time between revenue recognition and payment is not significant under any of the Company’s payment terms. Moreover, if the period between revenue recognition and when the customer pays is one year or less, the Company elected not to account for the significant financing component.
Other Revenue Recognition Policies
Shipping and handling activities are not considered a contractual performance obligation. The Company records shipping and handling costs billed to customers as revenue with offsetting costs recorded as cost of sale.
Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
Contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) net are reported at the contract level for each reporting period. Contract assets typically result from contracts when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer, and right to payment is not just subject to the passage of time. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when the rights become unconditional. The Company had 
no
 contract assets as of March 28, 2025 or March 29, 2024.
Contract liabilities typically result from billings in excess of revenues recognized and relate to products shipped near the end of the reporting period for which the required revenue recognition criteria were not met. The Company had 
no
 contract liabilities as of March 28, 2025 or March 29, 2024.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes compensation costs for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees based upon the awards’ estimated grant-date fair value. Typically, stock-based compensation expense is recognized evenly over the vesting period. However, stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based awards is recognized relative to the probability of achievement of the requisite milestones during the vesting period. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. Determining the fair value of certain stock-based compensation awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected life of the stock awards and the volatility of the underlying market-based and projected future cash flow assumptions. Any changes to those estimates that the Company makes from time to time may have a significant impact on the stock-based compensation expense recorded and could materially impact the Company’s results of operations.
Research and Development
The Company commits substantial capital and resources to internal and collaborative research and development projects in order to provide innovative products and solutions to its customers. The Company conducts research primarily to develop new technologies, enhance current product performance, improve the functionality and reliability of existing products, and develop revolutionary new products and solutions. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries, wages and other personnel-related costs, material costs and depreciation, consulting costs, software licensing costs, maintenance costs and facility costs.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations
The Company, through its subsidiaries, has various foreign defined benefit plans as well as U.S. defined contribution plans. Accredited independent actuaries calculate related plan assets, liabilities and expenses. The Company is required to make certain assumptions to assign value to the plan assets and liabilities. These assumptions are reviewed annually, based on current plan information and consultations with independent investment advisors and actuaries. The Company does not offer other defined benefits associated with postretirement benefit plans other than pensions.
The Company recognizes the funded status of a benefit plan on its consolidated balance sheets and recognizes gains, losses and prior service cost or credits that arise during the period that are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax. In addition, the Company measures defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end consolidated balance sheets and discloses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and transition asset or obligation.

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as measured by enacted tax rates anticipated to be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established.
The Company recognizes a liability for potential payments of taxes to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other tax matters. The recorded liability is based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is “more likely than not” to be realized. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. To the extent that the assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The Company establishes a liability, which is included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These liabilities are established when the Company believes that certain positions might be challenged despite the Company’s belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable. The recorded liability is adjusted considering changes in the facts and circumstances. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of the recorded liability and changes thereto.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
All undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested. Accordingly, the Company does not provide for U.S. income taxes on such undistributed earnings.
Net (Loss) Income Per Share
Basic net (loss) income per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to stockholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net (loss) income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised. Information about potentially dilutive and antidilutive shares for the reporting period is provided in Note 17, “Net (Loss) Income per Share.”

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions that management believes to be of a high credit quality. To manage credit risk related to accounts receivables, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of its customers and maintains allowances, to the extent necessary, for potential credit losses based upon the aging of its accounts receivable balances and known collection issues. The Company has not experienced any significant credit losses during the prior two years.
As of both March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, no distributor or customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s outstanding trade accounts receivable.

Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income

Other comprehensive (loss) income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are excluded from net income as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity, net of tax. The Company’s other comprehensive (loss) income was composed of foreign currency translation adjustments and pension liability adjustments.

Equity-Method Investments
The Company accounts for investments in common stock or partnership interests under the equity method if the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Investments in equity-method investees are included within “Equity investment in related party” in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s proportional share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees are classified as “Income (loss) in earnings of equity investment” in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company regularly evaluates these investments, which are not carried at fair value, for other-than-temporary impairment and records any impairment charge in earnings when the decline in value below the carrying amount of its equity method investment is determined to be other-than-temporary.
Subsequent Events Considerations

The Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements to provide additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. Subsequent events have been evaluated as required. The Company has evaluated all subsequent events and determined that, other than as reported herein, there are no material recognized or unrecognized subsequent events.

Recently Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) (“ASU 2024-03”). ASU 2024-03 requires additional disclosures of the nature of expenses included in the Company’s income statement. The new standard requires disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures about selling expenses. ASU 2024-03 will be applied prospectively with the option for retrospective application. The FASB subsequently issued ASU 2025-01 Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) to clarify that all public business entities are required to adopt the guidance as stipulated in ASU 2024-03 in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 requires entities to provide additional information of the Company’s tax rate reconciliation, as well as additional disclosures about income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2023-09 should be applied prospectively, but entities have the option to apply it retrospectively for each period presented. The Company does not anticipate this guidance will have an adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition, but will result in expanded disclosure within the financial statements.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). 
ASU 2023-07
 requires incremental disclosures in annual and interim periods related to a public entity’s reportable segments (particularly on segment expenses) but does not change the definition of a segment, the method for determining segments, or the criteria for aggregating operating segments into reportable segments. 
The Company 
adopted
 the new standard retrospectively for the fiscal year ending March 28, 2025. The adoption of this guidance did 
no
t have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

All other recent accounting pronouncements were determined to not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or related disclosures.

Business Combinations
Crocus
On August 7, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Crocus Technology International Corp., (“Crocus”). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, on October 31, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Crocus. The acquisition of Crocus complements and accelerates the Company’s tunnel magnetoresistance sensors roadmap and strengthens its position in the magnetic sensing market.
Notes Receivable from Crocus
On September 11, 2023, to fund the ongoing operations of Crocus prior to the Closing Date, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with Crocus, wherein the Company agreed to purchase promissory notes of up to $
7,000
. An initial promissory note of $
4,000
 was issued on September 11, 2023, and an additional promissory note was issued on October 2, 2023 for $
3,000
. The promissory notes were repaid in full in connection with the closing of the merger and included within the estimated fair value of consideration paid.
Allocation of Purchase Price
The acquisition of Crocus has been accounted for as a business combination. The purchase price for the acquisition is allocated based upon a valuation of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Management applied the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of the completed technology asset and the distributor method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships asset. The fair value of intangible assets was based on estimates and assumptions developed by management. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets required the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimating future cash flows relating to revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and technology obsolescence curves. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities were recorded as goodwill for the acquisition. As of March 28, 2025, the allocation of the purchase price has been finalized. No material changes were made to the preliminary purchase price allocation.

The goodwill acquired is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The amortization period for the intangible assets acquired is 
12 years
 for completed technology and 
15 years
 for customer relationships. The intangible assets are amortized using a method that approximates their economic benefit over their estimated useful lives. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) Crocus’ ability to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) Crocus’ ability to grow the business through new product introductions; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of Crocus’ operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. Amortization of completed technology is included within cost of goods sold, and customer relationship is i
ncluded within selling, general and administrative expenses.
The Company has not presented pro forma results of operations for Crocus because they are not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Acquisition-Related Costs
Crocus acquisition-related costs were 
$
722
 and

 for the 
fiscal years ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024, respectively, and are included in the selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Property, plant and equipment, net, including improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend useful life, are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Changes to estimated useful lives are recorded prospectively from the date of the change. Maintenance and repairs expenditures are charged to expense as incurred.
The Company continues to expand and optimize its global manufacturing capacities, such as by its recent expansion of operations at its Philippines location, and its acquisition of Crocus. Through its expansion efforts, newly acquired machinery and equipment and continuous maintenance and evaluation of on-hand equipment, the Company recognized advancements in equipment quality indicating increased estimated useful lives. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, following periodic review of the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets, the Company determined that the useful lives of its machinery and equipment should be increased. Effective March 30, 2024, the Company increased the useful lives of a significant portion of its machinery and equipment from 
seven years
 to 
ten years
. For the fiscal year ended March 28, 2025, these changes decreased depreciation expense by 
$
17,837
, decreased the benefit for income taxes by 
$

The planned disposal of these assets does not constitute a strategic shift in the Company’s operations and therefore does not meet the discontinued operations criteria. These assets are intended to be sold within 
one year
 of their designation as held for sale. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or the fair value less cost to sell. The value of these assets was measured at

ases include one or more options to exercise renewal terms, generally at the Company’s sole discretion, that can extend the lease term. Certain leases contain rights to terminate whereby those termination options are held by either the Company, the lessor, or both parties. These 
options to extend
 or 
terminate
 a lease are included in the lease term only when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company’s leases generally do not contain any material restrictive covenants.
Operating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while finance lease cost is amortized over the expected term on a straight-line basis. Information regarding the Company’s operating and finance leases are as follows:

Refinancing and Repricing of Term Loan Facility
On February 6, 2025, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement dated as of June 21, 2023 (as amended by the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, each of which are described below, and as further amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, refinanced or replaced from time to time, the “2023 Revolving Credit Agreement”), by and among the Company, Allegro MicroSystems, LLC (“AML”), lending institutions from time to time party thereto, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as the administrative agent and the collateral agent.
The Third Amendment provided for a new $
375,000
 tranche of term loans maturing in 2030 (the “2025 Refinanced Loans”), the proceeds of which were used, in relevant part, to (i) refinance all outstanding borrowing under the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility described below, (ii) pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing and (iii) for general corporate purposes. The 2025 Refinanced Loans amortize at a rate of

0.00
%
 per annum. The 2025 Refinanced Loans bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate equal to (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect from time to time plus 
2.00
% or (ii) the highest of (x) the Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 
0.50
%, (y) the prime lending rate or (z) the one-month Term SOFR plus 
1.00
% in effect from time to time plus 
1.00
%. The 2025 Refinanced Loans will mature on 
October 31, 2030
. The Company incurred costs of $
1,090
 in connection with the Third Amendment.
Payments of $
30,000
 and $
25,000
 were applied to the outstanding balance of the 2025 Refinanced Loans on February 28, 2025 and April 30, 2025, respectively.
The Company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of March 28, 2025.
2024 Refinancing of Term Loan Facility
On August 6, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 (the “Second Amendment”), to the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment increased the total capacity of the revolving credit facility to $
256,000
.
The Second Amendment also provided for a new $
400,000
 tranche of term loans maturing in 2030 (the “Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility”), the proceeds of which were primarily used, to repurchase a portion of the Company’s common stock, pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement discussed in Note 21, “Related Party Transactions,” repay the 2023 Term Loan Facility (as defined below), pay fees and expenses in connection w
ith the foregoing and for general corporate purposes. The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility amortized at a rate of 
1.00
% per annum. The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility bore interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate equal to (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement) in effect from time to time plus 
2.25
% or (ii) the highest of (x) the Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 
0.50
%, (y) the prime lending rate or (z) the one-month Term SOFR plus 
1.00
% in effect from time to time plus 
1.25
%. The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility was scheduled to mature on 
October 31, 2030
. The Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility was subject to covenants consistent with the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement covenants. As the terms of the refinancing were not substantially different from the terms of the Second Amendment, the refinancing was accounted for as a debt modification. In conjunction with the refinancing, the Company recognized $
3,619
 as a debt discount which will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term using the effective interest method. Borrowings under the Second Amendment were collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s assets.
A payment of $
25,000
 was applied to the term loan balance on October 31, 2024, which has eliminated future required minimum quarterly payments. On February 6, 2025, the Second Amendment was paid in full in connection with entry into the Third Amendment.

2023 Term Loan Facility
On October 31, 2023, the Company entered into a $
250,000
 term loan maturing in 2030 (the “2023 Term Loan Facility”), the proceeds of which were used to refinance the $
25,000
 outstanding balance under the term loan credit agreement that the Company entered into on September 30, 2020 with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the other agents, arrangers and lenders party thereto, and to finance, in part, the acquisition of Crocus. The 2023 Term Loan Facility was executed as an incremental amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement. The 2023 Term Loan Facility amortized at a rate of 
0.25
% per quarter, and the initial margin applicable to the 2023 Term Loan Facility was 
2.75
% for term SOFR-based loans and 
1.75
% for base rate loans.

A payment of $
50,000
 was applied to the term loan balance on April 30, 2024. 
On August 6, 2024, borrowings under the 2023 Term Loan Facility were repaid in full in connection with the entry into the Second Amendment.

2023 Revolving Credit Facility
On June 21, 2023, the Company entered into the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement that provided for a $
224,000
 revolving credit facility, which included a $
20,000
 letter of credit sub-facility. On August 6, 2024, upon entry into the Second Amendment, the total capacity of the revolving credit facility was increased to $
256,000
. The revolving credit facility is available until, and loans made thereunder will mature on, 
June 21, 2028
. Under the terms of the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement, interest is calculated at a rate equal to (i) Term SOFR (as defined in the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement) in effect, plus the applicable spread (ranging from 
1.50
% to 
1.75
%) or (ii) the highest of (x) the Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 
0.50
%, (y) the prime lending rate or (z) the one-month term SOFR plus 
1.00
% in effect, plus the applicable spread (ranging from 
0.50
% to 
0.75
%). The applicable spreads are based on the Company’s Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement) at the time of the applicable borrowing. Issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility were not significant. As of March 28, 2025, there were 
no
 outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
The Company will also pay a quarterly commitment fee of 
0.20
% to 
0.25
% on the daily amount by which the commitments under the revolving credit facility exceed the outstanding loans and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility. The 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including limitations on additional indebtedness, liens, various fundamental changes, dividends and distributions, investments (including acquisitions), transactions with affiliates, asset sales, prepayment of junior financing, changes in business and other limitations customary in senior secured credit facilities. In addition, the Company is required to maintain a Total Net Leverage Ratio of no more than 
4.00
 to 1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter, which may, subject to certain limitations, be increased to 
4.50
 to 1.00 for four fiscal quarters subsequent to the Company completing an acquisition for consideration in excess of $
500,000
.

The 2023 Revolving Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default. Upon an event of default, the administrative agent with the consent of, or at the request of, the holders of more than 
50
% in principal amount of the loans and commitments, may terminate the commitments and accelerate the maturity of the loans and enforce certain other remedies.
The Company was in compliance with its Revolving Credit Facility covenants as of March 28, 2025.

Retirement Plans
The Company recognizes the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligations) of its defined benefit pension plans in its consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), net of tax. Further, actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs that arise in future periods and are not recognized as net periodic benefit costs in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income. Those amounts will also be recognized as a component of future net periodic benefit costs consistent with the Company’s past practice. The Company uses a measurement date for its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans that is equivalent to its fiscal year end.
Plan Descriptions
Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plan
The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Allegro MicroSystems Philippines, Inc., has a defined benefit pension plan, which is a noncontributory plan that covers substantially all employees of this subsidiary. The plan’s assets are invested in government securities, common trust funds, bonds and other debt instruments and stocks.

As of March 28, 2025, the Company does not expect a significant return of plan assets during the next 12 months.
Assumptions and Investment Policies
The actuarial assumptions and methodologies used in determining the projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost are reviewed on an annual basis. The primary assumptions include the Non-U.S. assumed discount rates, the Non-U.S. expected long-term returns on plan assets, and the Non-U.S. rate of compensation increases.

The investments in the Company’s major benefit plans largely consist of low-cost, broad-market index funds to mitigate risks of concentration within the market sectors. The appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset-liability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost. The Company has added a greater proportion of fixed income securities to the non-U.S. defined benefit plan with return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. There are no significant restrictions on the amount or nature of the investments that may be acquired or held by the plans.

Commitments and Contingencies
Insurance
The Company, through its subsidiaries, utilizes self-insured employee health programs for employees in the U.S. The Company records estimated liabilities for its self-insured health programs based on information provided by the third-party plan administrators, historical claims experience and expected costs of claims incurred but not reported. The Company monitors its estimated liabilities on a quarterly basis. As facts change, it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.
Legal proceedings
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, and regulatory examinations or investigations arising in the normal course of business, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty, and the Company’s ultimate liability, if any, is difficult to predict. The Company records an accrual for legal contingencies when it is determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In making such

determinations, the Company evaluates, among other things, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred, the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the loss. If the occurrence of liability is probable and estimable, the Company will disclose the nature of the contingency and, if estimable, will provide the likely amount of such loss or range of loss. The Company does not believe there are any current matters that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Indemnification
From time to time, the Company has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless certain customers for potential allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights and patents arising from the use of its products. To date, the Company has not recognized or incurred any costs in connection with such indemnification arrangements.
Environmental Matters
The Company establishes accrued liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. If the contingency is resolved for an amount greater or less than the accrual, or the Company’s share of the contingency increases or decreases or other assumptions relevant to the development of the estimate were to change, the Company would recognize an additional expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations during the period such determination was made. No significant environmental contingencies have been recorded.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation through the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for share-based payment awards made to employees over the related requisite service period, including PSUs, RSUs and restricted shares (all part of our 2020 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan). Upon meeting the time-based vesting and, if applicable, any performance conditions, common shares of the Company (net of applicable tax withholding) are issued to the employee in exchange for each share-based unit.
RSUs generally have time-based vesting requirements with equal and annual graded vesting over approximately 
three years
 subsequent to the grant date. Upon voluntary termination of employment by any employee who is “retirement eligible” as of his or her termination date, the next vesting after the termination of employment will continue to vest. In order to be retirement eligible, an employee must be at least 
62
 years old, have completed a minimum of 
five years
 of service with the Company, and have provided at least three months’ prior written notice of termination of employment. All outstanding employee and director RSU awards are eligible for dividend equivalents regardless of vesting status.

Performance Stock Units
The Company also awards PSUs to its senior personnel based on achievement of metrics tied to financial plans approved by its Board of Directors for establishing target performances. Each award reflects a target number of shares (“Target Shares”) that may be issued to the award recipient. PSU awards are generally earned upon the completion of a multi-year performance period. Whether units are earned at the end of the performance period is determined based on the achievement of certain performance objectives over the performance period. The performance objectives include achieving various metrics such as revenue targets and cumulative earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization levels for the performance period, and relative total shareholder return. Depending on the results achieved over the multi-year performance period, the actual number of shares that a grant recipient may receive during and at the end of the period ranges from 
0
% to 
200
% of the Target Shares granted.

Entity restructurings are the net tax effect of transactions undertaken to streamline business operations, including the termination of a related party distributor and worthless stock deductions for our photonics subsidiaries, which fully ceased operating during the fiscal year. The March 29, 2024 entity restructuring relates to post-acquisition integrations to align business operations and integrate Crocus’s assets and workforce into the Company’s existing affiliates. The Company engaged in an intra-entity asset sale that resulted in a taxable gain reduced by net operating losses (“NOL”) in France and the generation and utilization of foreign tax credits in the U.S. Assets were transferred at fair market value pursuant to a valuation. The entity restructuring increased the effective tax rate primarily because a deferred tax liability was established on the difference between the fair market value and book value of Crocus’s intellectual property transferred to the U.S.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

Pursuant to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, U.S. tax law requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize domestic and foreign research and development expenditures over five and 15 years, respectively (“174 Capitalization”). The impact of 174 Capitalization to our deferred tax assets is 
$
87,759
.
As of March 29, 2024, as part of the Crocus acquisition, the Company acquired NOL and research and development tax credit (“R&D Credit”) carryforwards. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“IRC”), provides for a limitation of the annual use of NOLs, R&D Credits, and other tax attributes following certain ownership changes that limit the ability to utilize NOL and R&D Credit carryforwards. Under IRC Sections 382 and 383, an ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period. Crocus had multiple ownership changes and based on the existing Section 382 and 383 limitations its attributes are also subject to valuation allowances.
NOLs and capital losses may be available to reduce future taxable income. As of March 28, 2025, the Company had net Federal NOLs of 
$
3,798
 that were generated after December 31, 2017 and therefore carryforward indefinitely. As of March 28, 2025, the Company had utilized any available net state NOL carryforwards. As of March 28, 2025, the Company had net capital losses of 
$
1,457
, which are offset by a full valuation allowance.

As of March 28, 2025, the Company had net state R&D Credit carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income by 
$
3,153
. A valuation allowance has been established for 
$
2,793
 against such R&D Credits.

The Company’s intent is to permanently reinvest and use its existing foreign cash to fund its subsidiaries’ working capital needs, short-term and long-term capital projects, and to make investments and acquisitions. It is impracticable for the Company to determine the amount of the unrecognized tax liability due to the notional assumptions required and the complexities associated with these hypothetical calculations. No deferred tax liability has been established with respect to unremitted earnings and outside basis difference in its foreign subsidiaries.
The Company filed carryback claims allowable under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“the CARES Act”) to utilize NOLs and carryover credits generated during fiscal year 2021. As of March 28, 2025, the Company has an outstanding receivable of 
$
11,812
 related to these filings that are classified as a long-term tax receivable on the consolidated balance sheet.
Uncertain Tax Positions
As of March 28, 2025, March 29, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company had gross uncertain tax positions which would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. These amounts are recorded as a long-term liability, as the Company does not anticipate payment within one year.

The Company believes that all tax positions are adequately provided for; amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than the accrued position. Accordingly, the Company’s provisions for federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future might change as revised estimates are made, or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.
The Company’s policy is to classify interest expense and penalties, if any, as components of the income tax (benefit) provision in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded net increases of 
$

$
826

y 
$
1,230
 and 
$

, respectively.
Examinations by Tax Authorities
The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to examination by taxing authorities in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which it does business. Currently, the Internal Revenue Service is auditing the CARES Act carryback claim for fiscal year 2016 through 2021, and the Bureau of Internal Revenue is auditing our Philippine subsidiary for tax year 2019. U.S. and material foreign jurisdictions statutes of limitation remain open as of 2016.

Related Party Transactions
Share repurchase transactions with Sanken
On July 23, 2024, the Company entered into a share repurchase agreement with Sanken (the “Share Repurchase Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to repurchase 
38,767,315
 shares of the Company’s common stock from Sanken in a privately negotiated transaction at a price per share equal to the price per share at which the underwriters in a public underwritten equity offering of shares of our common stock would purchase the shares (the “Equity Offering”). The repurchase of shares of common stock occurred in two separate closings, with the first closing taking place after the closing of the Equity Offering (the “First Closing”) and the second closing occurring after the receipt of the proceeds from borrowings under the Refinanced 2023 Term Loan Facility (the “Second Closing”). The First Closing of the share repurchase was conditioned upon the closing of the Equity Offering and certain other conditions, and the Second Closing of the share repurchase was conditioned upon the receipt of net proceeds of no less than $

 per share. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 
3,750,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock at the same purchase price, which option was exercised in full prior to the closing of the Equity Offering.

28,750,000
 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $

28,750,000

The Company recognized a loss of $
