Borrowings
Term Loan
On May 28, 2021, Busey entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, pursuant to which it has access to (1) a $40.0 million revolving line of credit with an initial termination date of April 30, 2022, and (2) a $60.0 million Term Loan with a maturity date of May 31, 2026. The loans had an annual interest rate of 1.75% plus the one-month LIBOR rate. On April 30, 2022, the agreement was amended, effecting an extension of the termination date for the revolving line of credit to April 30, 2023, and providing for the transition from a LIBOR-indexed interest rate to a SOFR-indexed interest rate. Under the terms of the amendment, the annual interest rate for the loans was established at 1.80% plus the one-month forward-looking term rate based on SOFR. The agreement has subsequently been amended twice to extend the termination date for the revolving line of credit, which is currently April 30, 2025.
During the first quarter of 2024, Busey paid the full $30.0 million balance remaining on the Term Loan, at which time the Term Loan carried interest at a rate of 7.13%. As of December 31, 2024, there was no balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility incurs a non-usage fee based on any undrawn amounts.
Short-term Borrowings and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
Short-term borrowings include FHLB advances that mature in less than one year from the date of origination, and the current portion of long-term debt due within 12 months. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are classified as secured borrowings, generally mature daily.

Subordinated Notes
On June 1, 2020, Busey issued $125.0 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes that mature on June 1, 2030. The subordinated notes, which qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes, bear interest at an annual rate of 5.25% for the first five years after issuance and thereafter bear interest at a floating rate equal to a three-month benchmark rate plus a spread of 5.11%, as calculated on each applicable determination date. Interest on the subordinated notes is payable semi-annually on each June 1 and December 1 during the five-year fixed-term, and thereafter on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2025. The subordinated notes have an optional redemption in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after June 1, 2025. The subordinated notes are unsecured obligations of the Company.

On June 2, 2022, Busey issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes maturing June 15, 2032, which qualify as Tier 2 Capital for regulatory purposes. The price to the public for the subordinated notes was 100% of the principal amount of the subordinated notes. Interest on the subordinated notes accrues at a rate equal to (1) 5.000% per annum from the original issue date to, but excluding, June 15, 2027, payable semiannually in arrears, and (2) a floating rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be the Three-Month Term SOFR (as defined in the subordinated notes), plus a spread of 252 bps from and including June 15, 2027, payable quarterly in arrears. The subordinated notes have an optional redemption in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after June 15, 2027.
Associated with the M&M acquisition completed on April 1, 2024 (see 
“
Note 2. Mergers and Acquisitions
”
), Busey acquired $4.0 million of 5.25% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes maturing December 4, 2030, which qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. Interest on the subordinated notes accrues at a rate equal to (1) 5.25% per annum from the original issue date to December 4, 2025, and (2) a floating rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be the Three-Month Term SOFR (as defined in the subordinated notes), plus a spread of 497 bps from December 4, 2025. The subordinated notes have an optional redemption, in whole or in part, on or after December 4, 2025. At December 31, 2024, there was $0.1 million of fair value discount outstanding, to be accreted through the earliest optional redemption date.

Junior Subordinated Debt Owed to Unconsolidated Trusts
Busey maintains statutory trusts for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing trust preferred securities and related trust common securities. Proceeds from such issuances were used by the trusts to purchase junior subordinated notes of Busey, which are the sole assets of each trust. Concurrent with the issuance of the trust preferred securities, Busey issued guarantees for the benefit of the holders of the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities are instruments that qualify, and are treated, as Tier 1 regulatory capital. Busey owns all of the common securities of each trust. The trust preferred securities issued by each trust rank equally with the common securities in right of payment, except that if an event of default under the indenture governing the notes has occurred and is continuing, the preferred securities will rank senior to the common securities in right of payment. Busey had $74.8 million and $72.0 million of junior subordinated debt owed to unconsolidated trusts at December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. In connection with its acquisitions of Pulaski Financial Corp. in 2016 and M&M in 2024, Busey has acquired similar statutory trusts and the fair value adjustment is being accreted over their weighted average remaining lives, with a balance remaining to be accreted of $2.9 million and $2.6 million at December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

Liquidity
Liquidity management is the process by which Busey ensures that adequate liquid funds are available to meet the present and future cash flow obligations arising in the daily operations of its business. These financial obligations consist of needs for funds to meet commitments to borrowers for extensions of credit, fund capital expenditures, honor withdrawals by customers, pay dividends to stockholders, and pay operating expenses. Busey’s most liquid assets are cash and due from banks, interest-bearing bank deposits, and federal funds sold. Balances of these assets are dependent on Busey’s operating, investing, lending, and financing activities during any given period.

As of December 31, 2024, management believed that adequate liquidity existed to meet all projected cash flow obligations. Busey seeks to achieve a satisfactory degree of liquidity by actively managing both assets and liabilities. Asset management guides the proportion of liquid assets to total assets, while liability management monitors future funding requirements and prices liabilities accordingly.
Busey’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to service its debt is dependent on the receipt of cash dividends from its subsidiaries. Busey Bank paid dividends to First Busey Corporation totaling $100.0 million and $90.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
Busey Bank routinely enters into commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. The balance of commitments to extend credit represents future cash requirements and some of these commitments may expire without being drawn upon.

Cash Flows
Busey’s cash flows consist of operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.
Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $178.3 million in 2024, compared to $173.4 million provided by operating activities in 2023. Significant operating activities affecting cash flows include net income, depreciation and amortization, the provision for credit losses, stock-based compensation, and mortgage loan sale activity. Fluctuations in sales of loans held for sale are a function of changes in market rates for mortgage loans, which influence refinance activity.
Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $657.9 million in 2024, compared to $551.0 million provided by investing activities in 2023. Significant investing activities are those associated with managing Busey’s investment and loan portfolios.
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $858.1 million in 2024, compared to $232.0 million used in financing activities in 2023. Significant financing activities affecting cash flows include deposit and other borrowings, as well as cash dividends paid.

Capital Resources
Busey’s capital ratios are in excess of those required to be considered “well-capitalized” pursuant to applicable regulatory guidelines. The Federal Reserve uses capital adequacy guidelines in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks. Risk-based capital ratios are established by allocating assets and certain off-balance-sheet commitments into risk-weighted categories. These balances are then multiplied by the factor appropriate for that risk-weighted category. In order to refrain from restrictions on dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments, banking institutions must maintain capital in excess of regulatory minimum capital requirements. The table below presents minimum capital ratios that include the capital conservation buffer in comparison to the capital ratios for First Busey and Busey Bank as of December 31, 2024.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION
The effect of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from the effect on an industrial company. While a financial institution’s operating expenses, particularly salaries, wages, and employee benefits, are affected by general inflation, the asset and liability structure of a financial institution consists largely of monetary items. Monetary items, such as cash, loans, and deposits, are those assets and liabilities which are or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in prices. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does general inflation. For additional information regarding interest rates and changes in net interest income see

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk of changes in asset values due to movements in underlying market rates and prices. Interest rate risk is a type of market risk to earnings and capital arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting Busey as other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk, have a minimal impact or do not arise in the normal course of Busey’s business activities.
Busey has an asset-liability committee, whose policy is to meet at least quarterly, to review current market conditions and to structure the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
 to optimize stability in net interest income in consideration of projected future changes in interest rates.
As interest rate changes do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously, the asset-liability committee primarily relies on balance sheet and income simulation analysis to determine the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on net interest income. In these standard simulation models, the balance sheet is projected over a one-year and a two-year time horizon and net interest income is calculated under current market rates and assuming permanent instantaneous shifts of +/-100, +/-200, +/-300, and +/-400 bps. The model assumes immediate and sustained shifts in the federal funds rate and other market rate indices and corresponding shifts in other non-market rate indices based on their historical changes relative to changes in the federal funds rate and other market indices. Assets and liabilities are assumed to remain constant as of the measurement date; variable-rate assets and liabilities are repriced based on repricing frequency; and prepayment speeds on loans are projected for both declining and rising rate environments.
Busey’s interest rate risk resulting from immediate and sustained changes in interest rates, expressed as a change in net interest income as a percentage of the net interest income calculated in the constant base model, was as follows:

Interest rate risk is monitored and managed within approved policy limits and any temporary exceptions to policy in periods of rapid rate movement are approved and documented. The calculation of potential effects of hypothetical interest rate changes is based on numerous assumptions and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Actual results would likely differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of First Busey Corporation and Subsidiaries
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of First Busey Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans—Adjustments to Historical Loss Factors
As described in Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements, the Company’s allowance for credit losses totaled $83.4 million, which consists of a reserve on loans collectively evaluated for impairment (a/k/a general reserve) of $81.6 million and a reserve on loans individually evaluated (a/k/a specific reserve) of $1.8 million at December 31, 2024. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective loan pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. On a case‑by‑case basis, a loan may be evaluated on an individual basis based on disparate risk characteristics. The measurement of expected credit losses on collectively evaluated loans is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the amortized cost basis. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan‑specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions such as changes in unemployment rates, property values and other relevant factors. The calculation also contemplates that the Company may not be able to make or obtain such forecasts for the entire life of the financial assets and requires a reversion to historical credit loss information.
We identified the adjustments to historical loss factors component of the allowance for credit losses as a critical audit matter, as auditing the underlying adjustments required significant auditor judgment as amounts determined by management rely on analysis that is highly subjective and includes significant estimation uncertainty.
Our audit procedures related to the adjustments to historical factors within the allowance for credit losses include the following, among others:
•
We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the adjustments to historical factors in the calculation of the allowance for credit losses and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness.
•
We tested the completeness and accuracy of data used by management in determining adjustments to historical loss factors including testing the supporting data for agreement to internal or external source data.
•
We tested management’s conclusions regarding the appropriateness of the adjustments, including magnitude and directional consistency, to historical loss factors included in the allowance for credit losses calculation.

We or our predecessor firms have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1980; however, an earlier year could not be established.

FIRST BUSEY CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Nature of Operations
First Busey Corporation is a financial holding company organized under the laws of Nevada. First Busey Corporation’s subsidiaries provide retail and commercial banking services and payment technology solutions, and offer a full range of financial products and services including depository, lending, security brokerage, investment management, and fiduciary services, to individual, corporate, institutional, and governmental customers through their locations in Illinois, Missouri, southwest Florida and Indianapolis, Indiana. First Busey Corporation and its subsidiaries are subject to the regulations of certain regulatory agencies and undergo periodic examinations by those regulatory agencies.
Busey’s accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP. The 
Consolidated Financial Statements
 include the accounts of First Busey Corporation and its subsidiaries, which include Deed of Trust Services Corporation, and Busey Bank, including Busey Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiaries FirsTech, Pulaski Service Corporation, and Busey Capital Management, Inc. Further, until its dissolution on December 18, 2023, First Busey Risk Management was a subsidiary of First Busey Corporation and included in the Company’s 
Consolidated Financial Statements
. Operating results generated from acquired businesses are included with Busey’s results of operations starting from each date of acquisition. First Busey Corporation and its subsidiaries maintain various limited liability companies that hold specific assets for risk mitigation purposes and are consolidated into Busey’s 
Consolidated Financial Statements
. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Because Busey is not the primary beneficiary, the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
 exclude the following wholly-owned variable interest entities: First Busey Statutory Trust II, First Busey Statutory Trust III, First Busey Statutory Trust IV, Pulaski Financial Statutory Trust I, Pulaski Financial Statutory Trust II, and Merchants and Manufacturers Bank Statutory Trust I.
Use of Estimates
In preparing the accompanying 
Consolidated Financial Statements
 in conformity with GAAP, Busey’s management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the disclosures provided. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates which are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near-term relate to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, goodwill, income taxes, and the determination of the ACL.
Trust Assets
Assets held for customers in a fiduciary or agency capacity, other than trust cash on deposit at Busey Bank, are not Busey’s assets and, accordingly, are not included in the accompanying 
Consolidated Financial Statements
. Busey had assets under care of $
13.83
 billion at December 31, 2024, and $
12.14
 billion at December 31, 2023.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in process of collection, amounts due from other banks, interest-bearing deposits held with other financial institutions, and federal funds sold. The carrying amount of these instruments is considered a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Busey maintains its cash in deposit accounts, the balance of which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Busey has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Management believes Busey is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for under ASC Topic 805 
“Business Combinations”
 using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized, measured at their estimated fair values, as of the date Busey obtains control of the acquiree (the acquisition date). To estimate fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, Busey may utilize third-party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Further, management assumptions require consideration of future growth rates, future attrition, discount rates, multiples of earnings or other relevant factors.
Operating results generated from acquired businesses are included with Busey’s results of operations starting from each acquisition date. Acquisition related costs are costs that Busey incurs to effect a business combination, and may include legal, accounting, valuation, other professional or consulting fees, system conversions, and marketing costs. Busey accounts for acquisition related costs by recording them as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received. Costs that Busey expects, but is not obligated to incur in the future, to effect its plan to exit an activity of an acquiree or to terminate the employment of an acquiree’s employees are not liabilities at the acquisition date. Instead, Busey recognizes these costs in its post-combination 
Consolidated Financial Statements
 in accordance with other applicable accounting guidance.
Securities
Debt Securities Available for Sale
Debt securities classified as available for sale are those debt securities that Busey intends to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Any decision to sell a security classified as available for sale would be based on factors including significant movements in interest rates, changes in the maturity mix of Busey's assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, regulatory capital considerations, and other similar factors. Debt securities available for sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in OCI, net of taxes.
Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. The amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium are amortized to the earliest call date, while discounts on debt securities are amortized to maturity. Gains and losses on the sale of debt securities available for sale are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method.
Debt securities available for sale are not within the scope of the current expected credit losses methodology, however, the accounting for credit losses on these securities is affected by ASC Subtopic 326-30 
“Financial Instruments-Credit Losses—Available-for-Sale Debt Securities.”
 A debt security available for sale is impaired if the fair value of the security declines below its amortized cost basis. To determine the appropriate accounting, Busey must first determine if it intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before the fair value increases to at least the amortized cost basis. If either of those selling events is expected, Busey will write down the amortized cost basis of the security to its fair value. This is achieved by writing off any previously recorded allowance, if applicable, and recognizing any incremental impairment through earnings. If Busey neither intends to sell the security nor believes it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the fair value recovers to the amortized cost basis, Busey must determine whether any of the decline in fair value has resulted from a credit loss, or if it is entirely the result of noncredit factors.

Table of Contents

Contents of Item 8. Financial Statements & Supplementary Data
FIRST BUSEY CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Busey considers the following factors in assessing whether the decline is due to a credit loss:
•
Extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis;
•
Adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or a geographic area (for example, changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset-backed debt security, in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors);
•
Payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future;
•
Failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; and
•
Any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency.
Impairment related to a credit loss must be measured using the discounted cash flow method. Credit loss recognition is limited to the fair value of the security. Impairment is recognized by establishing an allowance for the debt security through the provision for credit losses. Impairment related to noncredit factors is recognized in AOCI, net of applicable taxes. Busey did not recognize any credit impairment on debt securities available for sale in 2024, 2023, or 2022.
Debt Securities Held to Maturity
Debt securities classified as held to maturity are those debt securities that Busey has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost. In 2022, Busey elected to transfer a portion of the agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio from available for sale to held to maturity. While held to maturity securities are within the scope of CECL, the standard allows for an assumption of zero credit losses when the expectation of non-payment is zero. The risk of credit loss related to mortgage-backed securities issued and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises is considered zero, therefore requiring no allowance to be recorded.
Accrued interest receivable for both debt securities available for sale and debt securities held to maturity totaled $
10.5
 million at December 31, 2024, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. Accrued interest receivable is reported in other assets on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
.
Equity Securities
Equity securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.
Loans Held for Sale
Loans held for sale include mortgage loans which Busey intends to sell to investors and/or the secondary mortgage market.
Busey accounts for loans held for sale at LOCOM. Loans held for sale are carried at amortized historical cost less loan write-offs and downward fair value adjustments, as may be applicable. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to income. Gains and losses on sales of loans are recognized at settlement dates and are determined by the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount, net of the value of any servicing assets for loans that were sold with servicing rights retained.

Loan Servicing
Servicing assets are recognized when servicing rights are acquired or retained through the sale of mortgage and government-guaranteed commercial loans. The unpaid principal balances of loans serviced by Busey for the benefit of others totaled $
582.5
 million as of December 31, 2024, and $
1.49
 billion as of December 31, 2023, and are not included in the accompanying 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. During the first quarter of 2024, Busey sold the mortgage servicing rights on approximately $
923.5
 million of one- to four-family mortgage loans for an estimated pre-tax gain of $
7.5
 million, which enabled Busey to sell available-for-sale debt securities with a book value of approximately $
108.2
 million for a pre-tax loss of $
6.8
 million.
Servicing rights are initially recorded at estimated fair value, which is determined using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. Capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights is included in mortgage revenue. The amortization of government-guaranteed commercial loan servicing rights is included in other income.
Servicing rights are periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of those rights as compared to the carrying amount. Fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows based on expected prepayment rates and other inputs. For purposes of measuring impairment, servicing rights are stratified by one or more predominant characteristics of the underlying loans. A valuation allowance is recognized in the amount by which the amortized cost of the rights for each stratum exceeds its fair value, if any. If Busey later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular group of loans, a reversal of the allowance may be recorded in current period earnings. Busey had an 
immaterial
 amount of impairment recorded at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Servicing fee income is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal and are recorded as income when earned.
Portfolio Loans
Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future, or until maturity or pay-off, are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts, deferred origination fees and costs, charge-offs, and the ACL.
Loan origination fees, net of certain direct loan origination costs, are deferred and the net amount is amortized as an adjustment of the related loan’s yield. Busey amortizes the net amount over the contractual life of the related loan.
Interest income is accrued daily on outstanding loan balances. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan.
Interest accrued but not collected for loans that are charged-off or placed on non-accrual status is reversed against interest income. The interest on non-accrual loans is accounted for on the cost-recovery method, until returned to accrual status. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.

Loan Modifications
Busey’s loan portfolio includes certain loans that have been modified in accordance with loan refinancing and restructuring guidance in ASC Subtopic 310-20-35-9 through 35-11 
“Receivables—Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs—Subsequent Measurement—Loan Refinancing or Restructuring”
 for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. For additional information about loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, see “
Note

Allowance for Credit Losses
The ACL is a significant estimate on Busey’s 
Consolidated Financial Statements
, affecting both earnings and capital. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the portfolio loans’ amortized cost bases to present the net amount expected to be collected on the portfolio loans. Portfolio loans are charged off against the ACL when management believes the loan balance is uncollectible. Recoveries will be recognized up to the aggregate amount of previously charged-off balances. The ACL is established through the provision for credit loss charged to income.
A loan’s amortized cost basis is comprised of the unpaid principal balance of the loan net of charge-offs, accrued interest receivable, purchase premiums or discounts, and net deferred origination fees or costs. Busey has estimated its allowance on the amortized cost basis, exclusive of government guaranteed loans and accrued interest receivable. Further, as permitted under the practical expedient provided within ASC 326-20-35-6, Busey did not record an ACL for its Life Equity Loan
®
 portfolio due to no expected credit loss at default. Busey writes-off uncollectible accrued interest receivable in a timely manner and has elected to not measure an allowance for accrued interest receivable.

Busey presents the aggregate amount of accrued interest receivable for all financial instruments in other assets on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
 and the balance of accrued interest receivable is disclosed in 
“
Note 20. Fair Value Measurements.
”
Busey’s methodology influences, and is influenced by, Busey’s overall credit risk management processes. The ACL is managed in accordance with GAAP to provide an adequate reserve for expected credit losses that is reflective of management’s best estimate of what is expected to be collected. The ACL must be determined on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. On a case-by-case basis, Busey may conclude that a loan should be evaluated on an individual basis based on disparate risk characteristics.
The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the amortized cost basis. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, and other relevant factors. The calculation also contemplates that Busey may not be able to make or obtain such forecasts for the entire life of the financial assets and requires a reversion to historical credit loss information. Due to the continued economic uncertainty in the markets in which the Company operates, Busey will continue to utilize a forecast period of 12 months with an immediate reversion to historical loss rates beyond this forecast period in its ACL estimate.
Ongoing impacts of CECL will be dependent upon changes in economic conditions and forecasts, originated and acquired loan portfolio composition, prepayment speeds, credit performance trends, portfolio duration, and other factors.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Assets Purchased with Credit Deterioration
Acquired loans are separated into two categories based on the credit risk characteristics of the underlying borrowers: (1) PCD, for loans which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination, or (2) all other loans.
For PCD loans, an ACL is determined at the date of acquisition using the same methodology as other loans held for investment. This initial ACL, when determined on a collective basis, is allocated to the individual loans, and the sum of each loan’s purchase price and ACL becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. The ACL on PCD loans is recorded in the acquisition accounting and no provision for credit losses is recognized at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the ACL are recorded as a charge to the provision for credit losses.
For all other loans, an ACL is established immediately after the acquisition through a charge to the provision for credit losses.
Upon adoption of ASC Topic 326 
“Financial Instruments-Credit Losses”
 Busey applied the prospective transition approach for financial assets considered PCD that were previously classified as PCI and accounted for under ASC Subtopic 310-30 
“Receivables—Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality.”
 In accordance with the standard, management did not reassess whether PCI assets met the criteria of PCD assets as of the date of adoption. The amortized cost basis of these PCD assets was adjusted to reflect an ACL for any remaining credit discount. The noncredit discount is being accreted into interest income using the January 1, 2020, effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in expected cash flows will be adjusted through the ACL.
Other Real Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets
OREO and other repossessed assets represent properties and other assets acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings in settlement of loans. OREO and other repossessed assets are recorded at the fair value of the property or asset, less estimated costs of disposal, which establishes a new cost basis. Any adjustment to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO or other repossessed assets is charged to the ACL. OREO property and other repossessed assets are evaluated regularly to ensure the recorded amount is supported by its current fair value; write downs or valuation allowances to reduce the carrying amount to fair value less estimated costs to dispose are recorded, as necessary. OREO and other repossessed assets are included in other assets on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. Revenue, expense, gains, and losses from the operations of foreclosed assets are included in earnings.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including premises and equipment, right of use assets, and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. Cash flows used for this analysis are those directly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Any impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.

Premises and Equipment
Land is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation of depreciable land improvements. Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. 
The estimated useful lives for premises and equipment are:
Asset Description
Estimated Useful Life
Buildings and improvements
3
 — 
40
 years
Furniture and equipment
3
 — 
10
 years
Premises and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with Busey’s policies regarding long-lived assets.
Bank property held for sale, included in premises and equipment, represents certain banking center office buildings which Busey had closed and consolidated with other existing banking centers. Bank property held for sale is measured at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell, and depreciation has been stopped.
Leases
A determination is made at inception if an arrangement contains a lease. For arrangements containing leases, Busey recognizes leases on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
 as right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities. Lease-related assets, or right of use assets, are recognized on the lease commencement date at amounts equal to the respective lease liabilities, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, initial direct costs, and lease incentives received. Lease-related liabilities are recognized at the present value of the remaining contractual fixed lease payments, discounted using the rate implicit in the lease or Busey’s incremental borrowing rate.
ASC Topic 842 
“Leases”
 requires the use of the rate implicit in the lease whenever this rate is readily determinable. If not readily determinable, Busey uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term. For operating leases existing prior to Busey’s adoption of ASC Topic 842 on January 1, 2019, Busey used a borrowing rate that corresponded to the lease term remaining as of the date of adoption of ASC Topic 842.
Busey’s lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at Busey’s discretion. When Busey considers the exercise of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, that renewal term is included in the calculation of the right of use asset and lease liability.
Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any renewal terms available through options to renew that Busey is reasonably certain to exercise. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.
Right of use assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with Busey’s policies regarding long-lived assets.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to at least annual impairment assessments. A separate goodwill impairment assessment is performed for each reporting unit on the goodwill that has been allocated to it. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available, and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. Busey’s reporting units are the same as its operating segments. Busey has established December 31 as the annual impairment assessment date for each of its reporting units. As part of this assessment, each reporting unit's carrying value is compared to its fair value.
Busey estimates the fair value of its reporting units as of the measurement date utilizing valuation methodologies including comparable company analysis and precedent transaction analysis. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. There was 
no
 impairment as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Other intangible assets consist of core deposit and acquired customer relationship intangible assets arising from acquisitions. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with Busey’s policies regarding long-lived assets.
See “
Note 8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
” for additional information.
Cash Surrender Value of Bank Owned Life Insurance
Busey has purchased, or acquired through acquisitions, life insurance policies on certain executives and senior officers. Life insurance is recorded at its cash surrender value, which approximates its fair value.
Busey maintains a liability for post-employment benefits related to split-dollar life insurance arrangements. In an endorsement split-dollar life insurance arrangement, the employer owns and controls the policy, and the employer and employee split the life insurance policy’s cash surrender value and/or death benefits. If the employer agrees to maintain a life insurance policy during the employee’s retirement, the present value of the cost of maintaining the insurance policy is accrued over the employee’s active service period. Similarly, if the employer agrees to provide the employee with a death benefit, the present value of the death benefit is accrued over the employee’s active service period. Busey accrued liabilities for these arrangements totaling $
5.7
 million as of December 31, 2024, and $5.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Liabilities for post-employment benefits are included in other liabilities on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
.
Restricted Bank Stock
During the fourth quarter of 2024 Busey Bank became a member of the Federal Reserve System. Federal Reserve member banks are required to own a certain amount of Federal Reserve Bank stock. Busey's investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock was $
43.9
 million as of December 31, 2024. Busey’s investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock represents approximately half of the total required subscription, and the remaining half is unpaid and remains subject to call by the Federal Reserve Bank. As such, Busey reserved cash of $
43.9
 million as of December 31, 2024.
Busey Bank is a member of the FHLB system. FHLB members are required to own a certain amount of FHLB stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. Busey's investment in FHLB stock was $
6.0
 million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when: (1) the assets have been isolated from Busey’s assets, (2) the transferee obtains the right to pledge or exchange the assets it receives, and no condition both constrains the transferee from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange and provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor, and (3) Busey does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets. When transfers of financial assets fail to meet these criteria, those transfers are accounted for as secured borrowings.
Income Taxes
Busey is subject to income taxes in U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions. First Busey Corporation and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal and state income tax returns with each subsidiary computing its taxes on a separate entity basis. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations, which requires significant judgment. Busey is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2021.
Under GAAP, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management’s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, the forecasts of future income, applicable tax planning strategies, and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions.
In 2024, Busey recorded a one-time deferred tax valuation adjustment of $
1.4
 million resulting from a change to the Illinois apportionment rate due to recently enacted regulations. These new regulations are expected to lower Busey’s ongoing tax obligation in future periods, but created a negative adjustment to the carrying value of Busey’s deferred tax asset in 2024. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets included in the accompanying 
Consolidated Financial Statements
 will be fully realized. Busey determined that 
no
 valuation allowance was required as of December 31, 2024, or 2023.
Positions taken in tax returns may be subject to challenge upon examination by the taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions are initially recognized on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
 when it is more likely than not the position will not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. When applicable, Busey recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in operating expenses.
At December 31, 2024, Busey Bank was under examination by the Florida Department of Revenue for its 2020 to 2022 corporate income tax filings. Busey Bank accrued $
0.1
 million related to potential assessment adjustments and interest. Other than this, Busey had 
no
 accruals for payments of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2024, or 2023. Further, in February of 2025, Busey received notice of audit initiation from the Illinois Department of Revenue for M&M’s tax filings for the tax years 2022 and 2023.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tax Credit and Other Investments in Unconsolidated Entities
Busey has invested in certain tax-advantaged projects promoting affordable housing, new markets, and historic rehabilitation. These investments are designed to generate returns primarily though the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of the investments, over specified time periods. These investments are considered to be variable interest entities, and are accounted for under the equity, cost, or proportional amortization practical expedient methods, as appropriate. These investments involve significant management judgments, including a determination of which entities have the power to direct activities, and whether these entities are variable interest entities. Busey is required to evaluate whether to consolidate a variable interest entity at both inception and on an ongoing basis. Busey is not required to consolidate variable interest entities in which it has concluded it does not have a controlling financial interest and is not the primary beneficiary. Busey’s maximum exposure to loss related to its investments in these unconsolidated variable interest entities is limited to the carrying amount of the investment, net of any unfunded capital commitments and previously recorded tax credits which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level. Busey believes potential losses from these investments are remote. In addition, Busey has private equity investments, which are primarily in funds that invest in small businesses across diverse sectors including, but not limited to, financial technology, business services, manufacturing, agribusiness, healthcare, software as a service, and environmental, or supporting the preservation of affordable housing.
Upon adoption of ASU 2023-02 on January 1, 2024, Busey elected to apply the proportional amortization method in accounting for investments in tax-advantaged projects. Income tax credits and other tax benefits, net of investment amortization, were included as a component of Busey’s estimated annual effective tax rate used for the calculation of income taxes presented on the 
Consolidated Statements of Income
.
For additional information regarding these investments, see “
Note 14. Tax Credit and Other Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

Treasury Stock
Treasury stock acquired is recorded at cost. Treasury stock issued is valued based on the “first-in, first-out” method. Gains and losses on issuance are recorded as increases or decreases to additional paid-in capital.
Stock-Based Employee Compensation
Busey’s equity incentive plans are designed to encourage ownership of its common stock by its employees and directors, to provide additional incentive for them to promote the success of Busey’s business, and to attract and retain talented personnel.
2020 Equity Plan
The 2020 Equity Plan was originally approved by stockholders at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. A description of the 2020 Equity Plan, as originally approved, can be found in 
Appendix A
 within 
Busey’s Proxy Statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders filed on April 9, 2020
. Upon the 2020 Equity Plan’s original approval, it replaced the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and the First Community 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, which, from time to time, Busey used to grant equity awards to legacy employees of First Community. Under the terms of the 2020 Equity Plan, Busey has granted RSU, DSU, and PSU awards.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An amendment to and restatement of the 2020 Equity Plan was approved by stockholders at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The terms of the amended and restated 2020 Equity Plan are substantially identical to those of the originally approved 2020 Equity Plan, other than a 
1,350,000
 increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan. More information can be found in 
Appendix A
 within 
Busey’s Proxy Statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders filed on April 14, 2023
.
All of Busey’s employees and directors and those of its subsidiaries are eligible to receive awards under the plans.
RSU Awards
Busey grants RSU awards to members of management periodically throughout the year. RSU awards are stock-based awards for which vesting is conditional upon meeting established service criteria. Each RSU is equivalent to 
one
 share of Busey’s common stock. Busey’s RSUs have requisite service periods ranging from 
one year
 to 
five years
, and are subject to accelerated vesting upon eligible retirement from Busey. Recipients earn quarterly dividend equivalents on their respective RSUs, which entitle the recipients to additional units. Therefore, dividends earned each quarter compound based upon the updated unit balances.
PSU Awards
Busey grants PSU awards to members of management periodically throughout the year. PSU awards are stock-based awards for which vesting is conditional upon meeting established performance criteria for the applicable performance period and remaining employed through the end of such performance period. Each PSU is equivalent to 
one
 share of Busey’s common stock. The number of PSUs that ultimately vest will be determined based on the extent to which the established performance criteria are achieved. Busey’s PSUs are subject to accelerated service-based vesting conditions upon eligible retirement from Busey. After performance determination, dividend equivalents are compounded based upon each dividend date during the performance period.
DSU Awards
Busey grants DSU awards to its non-employee directors. DSU awards are stock-based awards with a deferred settlement date. Each DSU is equivalent to 
one
 share of Busey’s common stock. DSUs vest over a 
one-year
 period following the grant date. Under the 2020 Equity Plan, DSUs are generally subject to the same terms as RSUs, except that following vesting of DSUs, settlement occurs within 
30
 days following the earlier of separation from the board or a change in control of the Company. After vesting and prior to delivery, DSUs will continue to earn dividend equivalents.
Stock Options
Busey has outstanding stock options assumed from acquisitions. All stock options that remained outstanding as of December 31, 2024, were fully vested.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The First Busey Corporation ESPP was approved at Busey’s 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and details can be found in 
Appendix A
 within 
First Busey’s Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on April 8, 2021
. The purpose of the ESPP is to provide a means through which Busey associates may acquire a proprietary interest in the Company by purchasing shares of its common stock at a discounted price through voluntary payroll deductions, to assist in retaining the services of current associates and securing and retaining the services of new associates, and to provide incentives for Busey associates to exert maximum efforts toward the Company’s success.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Because the ESPP provides opportunity for Busey associates to purchase Busey’s common stock at a 
15
% discount from the market price, the plan is considered to be a compensatory plan under current accounting guidance. Therefore, the entire amount of the discount is recognized in salaries, wages, and employee benefits on the 
Consolidated Statements of Income

 for further discussion.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business, to meet the financing needs of its customers, Busey is a party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk, including commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. Busey’s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of the commitments. Busey uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as no condition established in the contract has been violated. These commitments are generally at variable interest rates, they generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and they may require the customer to pay a fee. Commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. These commitments may be secured based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments Busey has issued to guarantee the performance of a customer’s obligation to a third-party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Busey holds collateral, which may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, and income producing properties, supporting those commitments if deemed necessary. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third-party, Busey would be required to fund the commitment. If the commitment is funded, Busey would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer.
Busey estimates expected credit losses for off-balance sheet arrangements over the contractual period during which it is exposed to credit risk via a present contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the issuer. To be considered unconditionally cancellable for accounting purposes, Busey must have the ability to, at any time, with or without cause, refuse to extend credit under the commitment. Off-balance-sheet credit exposure segments share the same risk characteristics as portfolio loans. Busey incorporates a probability of funding and utilizes the ACL loss rates to calculate a reserve for off-balance-sheet credit exposure, which is carried on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
 in other liabilities rather than as a component of the ACL. The reserve for off-balance-sheet credit exposure is adjusted as a provision for off-balance-sheet credit exposure and is reported as a component of noninterest expense in the accompanying 
Consolidated Statements of Income
. Liabilities recorded as reserves for Busey’s off-balance sheet credit exposure under these commitments totaled $
6.0
 million as of December 31, 2024, and $
7.1
 million as of December 31, 2023.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Busey utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of its asset liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position. Additionally, Busey enters into derivative financial instruments, including interest rate lock commitments issued to residential loan customers for loans that will be held for sale, forward sales commitments to sell residential mortgage loans to investors, and interest rate swaps with customers and other third parties.

Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Cash Flow Hedges
Busey entered into derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges. For a derivative instrument that qualifies and is designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in fair value of components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.
Interest Rate Swaps Not Designated as Hedges
Busey may offer derivative contracts to its customers in connection with their risk management needs. Busey manages the risk associated with these contracts by entering into equal and offsetting derivatives with third-party dealers. Generally, these derivatives have worked together as an economic interest rate hedge, but Busey did not designate them for hedge accounting treatment. Consequently, changes in fair value of the corresponding derivative financial asset or liability were recorded as either a charge or credit to current earnings during the period in which the changes occurred.
Interest Rate Lock Commitments
Interest rate lock commitments that meet the definition of derivative financial instruments under ASC Topic 815 
“Derivatives and Hedging”
 are carried at their fair values in other assets or other liabilities on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
, with changes in the fair values of the corresponding derivative financial assets or liabilities recorded as either a charge or credit to mortgage revenue during the period in which the changes occurred.
Forward Sales Commitments
Busey economically hedges mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments issued to its residential loan customers related to loans that will be held for sale by obtaining corresponding forward sales commitments with an investor to sell the loans at an agreed-upon price at the time the interest rate locks are issued to the customers. Forward sales commitments that meet the definition of derivative financial instruments under ASC Topic 815 
“Derivatives and Hedging”
 are carried at their fair values in other assets or other liabilities on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
. While such forward sales commitments generally served as an economic hedge to mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments, Busey did not designate them for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in fair value of the corresponding derivative financial asset or liability were recorded as either a charge or credit to mortgage revenue during the period in which the changes occurred.
Risk Participation Agreements
Busey has entered into risk participation agreements to manage the credit risk of its derivative position. These agreements transfer credit risk related to an interest rate swap to another financial institution. Risk participation agreements that Busey has entered into are structured as follows:

Busey has a swap agreement with a customer. Busey (purchaser) entered into a risk participation agreement with a counterparty (seller), under which the counterparty receives a fee to accept a portion of the credit risk. If Busey’s customer defaults on the swap contract, the counterparty to the risk participation agreement must reimburse Busey for the counterparty's percentage of the positive fair value (from the purchaser’s perspective) of the customer swap as of the default date. If the customer swap has a negative fair value (from the purchaser’s perspective), the counterparty has no reimbursement requirements. If Busey’s customer defaults on the swap contract and the counterparty (seller) fulfills its payment obligations under the risk participation agreement, the counterparty (seller) is entitled to a pro rata share of Busey’s claim against the customer under the terms of the swap agreement.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in 
“
Note 20. Fair Value Measurements
.”
 Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains, and losses be included in net income. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges, are reported net of taxes as a separate component within the equity section of the balance sheet, such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income (loss).

Segment Disclosure
Operating segments are components of a business that (1) engage in business activities from which the component may earn revenues and incur expenses; (2) have operating results that are reviewed regularly by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance; and (3) for which discrete financial information is available. Busey’s chief executive officer is its chief operating decision maker. Busey’s has 
three
 reportable segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and FirsTech. See

Note 23. Operating Segments and Related Information

 for further discussion.
Revenue
ASC Topic 606 
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers”
 outlines a single model for companies to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most prior revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASC Topic 606 requires that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract and establishes additional disclosures. Busey’s revenue is comprised of net interest income, which is explicitly excluded from the scope of ASC Topic 606, and noninterest income. Busey has evaluated its noninterest income and the nature of its contracts with customers and determined that further disaggregation of revenue beyond what is presented in the accompanying 
Consolidated Financial Statements
 is not necessary. Busey satisfies its performance obligations on its contracts with customers as services are rendered, so there is limited judgment involved in applying ASC Topic 606 that affects the determination of the timing and amount of revenue from contracts with customers.
Descriptions of Busey’s primary revenue generating activities that are within the scope of ASC Topic 606, and are presented in the accompanying 
Consolidated Statements of Income
 as components of noninterest income, include wealth management fees, payment technology solutions, and fees for customer services.
Wealth Management Fees
Wealth management fees represent fees due from wealth management customers as consideration for managing the customers' assets. Wealth management and trust services include custody of assets, investment management, fees for trust services, and other fiduciary activities. Also included are fees received from a third-party broker-dealer as part of a revenue sharing agreement for fees earned from customers that Busey refers to the third party. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is completed, which is generally monthly.
Payment Technology Solutions
Payment technology solutions revenue represents transaction-based fees for technology-driven payment solutions primarily for walk-in, lockbox, interactive voice recognition, and online bill payments through Busey Bank’s subsidiary, FirsTech. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is completed, which is generally monthly.
Fees for Customer Services
Fees for customer services consist of time-based revenue from service fees for account maintenance, item-based revenue from fee-based activity, and transaction-based fee revenue. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is completed, which is generally monthly for account maintenance services, or when a transaction has been completed. Payments for such performance obligations are generally received at the time the performance obligations are satisfied.

Reclassifications have been made to certain prior year account balances, with no effect on net income or stockholders’ equity, to be consistent with the classifications adopted as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Impact of Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023‑07 “
Segment Reporting (Topic 820): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
” requiring enhanced disclosures related to significant segment expenses. This standard was adopted on a retrospective basis beginning with the annual reporting period ending December 31, 2024. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on Busey’s financial position or results of operations, but resulted in enhanced disclosures.
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023‑02 
“Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323),”
 permitting an election to use the proportional amortization method to account for equity investments made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits and other income tax benefits, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, provided that certain conditions are met. The proportional amortization method results in the cost of the investment being amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received, with the amortization of the investment and the income tax credits being presented net in the income statement as a component of income tax expense. Busey adopted this standard on a modified retrospective basis on January 1, 2024. Upon adoption, Busey recorded an after-tax decrease to retained earnings of $
1.4
 million for the cumulative effect of adopting ASU 2023‑02. This transition adjustment included a $
2.4
 million decrease in other assets, a $
0.5
 million decrease in other liabilities, and a $
0.5
 million increase in deferred tax assets.
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023‑01 “
Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements
,” which requires amortization over the useful life of leasehold improvements (not the lease term) when the lease is between entities under common control, and any value of such leasehold improvements remaining at the end of the lease term is to be accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control. Busey adopted this standard on a prospective basis on January 1, 2024. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on Busey’s financial position or results of operations.
In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03 
“Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions,”
 which clarifies that contractual restrictions on the sale of equity securities are not considered in measuring the fair value of those equity securities, and further that contractual sale restrictions cannot be recognized and measured as a separate unit of account. Busey adopted this standard on a prospective basis on January 1, 2024. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on Busey’s financial position or results of operations.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-04 “
Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments
” to clarify when certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an induced conversion. The amendments in this update may be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis and will be effective for Busey for annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2026. Because Busey does not currently have any convertible debt, the Company does not expect adoption of this ASU to have any impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Busey operated M&M Bank as a separate banking subsidiary of Busey until it was merged with Busey Bank on June 21, 2024. At the time of the bank merger, M&M Bank’s banking centers became banking centers of Busey Bank, except for M&M’s banking center located at 990 Essington Rd., Joliet, Illinois, which was closed in connection with the bank merger.
Merger Consideration
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of M&M common stock converted to the right to receive, at the election of each stockholder and subject to proration and adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement, either (1) $
117.74
 in cash (“Cash Election”), (2) 
5.7294
 shares of Busey common stock (“Share Election”), or (3) mixed consideration of $
34.55
 in cash and 
4.0481
 shares of Busey common stock (“Mixed Election”).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Most of the M&M common stockholders who submitted an election form by the election deadline made the Share Election to receive their Merger consideration solely in the form of shares of Busey common stock. As a result of the elections of M&M common stockholders, and in accordance with the proration and adjustment provisions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger consideration paid to M&M common stockholders was comprised of an aggregate of 
1,429,304
 shares of Busey common stock and an aggregate of $
12.2
 million in cash, allocated as follows for each share of M&M stock: (1) $
117.74
 in cash for the Cash Election, (2) $
5.3966
 in cash and 
5.4668
 shares of Busey common stock for the Share Election, and (3) $
34.55
 in cash and 
4.0481
 shares of Busey common stock for the Mixed Election. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, M&M common stockholders that did not make an election or submit a properly completed election form by the election deadline of March 29, 2024, received cash consideration of $
117.74
 for each share of M&M common stock held. No fractional shares of Busey common stock were issued in the Merger. Fractional shares were paid in cash at the rate of $
23.32
 per share.
Additional Merger consideration of $
3.0
 million was paid to redeem 
300
 shares of M&M preferred stock.
Acquisition Accounting
This transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair values on April 1, 2024, the date of acquisition. Fair values, including initial accounting for deferred taxes, are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date as additional information regarding the closing date fair values becomes available. Fair value adjustments totaling $
0.4
 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024, as additional information became available regarding unrecorded assets and liabilities. Busey does not expect any further adjustments will be necessary.
As the total consideration paid for M&M exceeded the estimated fair value of net assets acquired, goodwill of $
15.8
 million was recorded as a result of the acquisition. Goodwill recorded for this transaction reflects synergies expected from the acquisition and expansion within the Chicago metropolitan market, and was assigned to the Banking operating segment. None of the goodwill recognized in the M&M acquisition is expected to be tax deductible.

Unrealized and unrecognized losses were related to changes in market interest rates and market conditions that do not represent credit-related impairments. Unless part of a corporate strategy or restructuring plan, Busey does not intend to sell securities that are in an unrealized or unrecognized loss position, and it is more likely than not that Busey will recover the amortized cost prior to being required to sell the debt securities. Full collection of the amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities is expected; therefore, no ACL was recorded in relation to debt securities, and the impairment related to noncredit factors on debt securities available for sale is recognized in AOCI, net of applicable taxes. As of December 31, 2024, Busey did not hold general obligation bonds of any single issuer, the aggregate of which exceeded 10% of Busey’s stockholders’ equity.

Risk Grading
Busey utilizes a loan grading scale to assign a risk grade to all of its loans. A description of the general characteristics of each grade is as follows:
•
Pass 
– This category includes loans that are all considered acceptable credits, ranging from investment or near investment grade, to loans made to borrowers who exhibit credit fundamentals that meet or exceed industry standards.
•
Watch 
– This category includes loans that warrant a higher-than-average level of monitoring to ensure that weaknesses do not cause the inability of the credit to perform as expected. These loans are not necessarily a problem due to other inherent strengths of the credit, such as guarantor strength, but have above average concern and monitoring.
•
Special mention 
– This category is for “Other Assets Specially Mentioned” loans that have potential weaknesses, which may, if not checked or corrected, weaken the asset, or inadequately protect Busey’s credit position at some future date.
•
Substandard 
– This category includes “Substandard” loans, determined in accordance with regulatory guidelines, for which the accrual of interest has not been stopped. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that Busey will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
•
Substandard non-accrual 
– This category includes loans that have all the characteristics of a “Substandard” loan with additional factors that make collection in full highly questionable and improbable. Such loans are placed on non-accrual status and may be dependent on collateral with a value that is difficult to determine.
All loans are graded at their inception. Commercial lending relationships that are $
1.0
 million or less are usually processed through an expedited underwriting process. Most commercial loans greater than $
1.0
 million are included in a portfolio review at least annually. Commercial loans greater than $
0.35
 million that have a grading of special mention or worse are typically reviewed on a quarterly basis. Interim reviews may take place if circumstances of the borrower warrant a more frequent review.

Collateral Dependent Loans
Management's evaluation as to the ultimate collectability of loans includes estimates regarding future cash flows from operations and the value of property, real and personal, pledged as collateral. These estimates are affected by changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of borrowers. Collateral dependent loans are loans in which repayment is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment. Loans are written down to the lower of cost or fair value of underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell. Busey had $
19.3
 million and $
6.1
 million of collateral dependent loans secured by real estate or business assets as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Allowance for Credit Losses
Management estimates the ACL balance using relevant available information from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. The cumulative loss rate used as the basis for the estimate of credit losses is comprised of Busey’s historical loss experience beginning in 2010. Due to the continued economic uncertainty in the markets in which the Company operates, Busey will continue to utilize a forecast period of 12 months with an immediate reversion to historical loss rates beyond this forecast period in its ACL estimate.
The following table summarizes activity in the ACL attributable to each lending activity. Allocation of a portion of the ACL to one lending activity does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other lending activities

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are classified as secured borrowings, generally mature daily. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. The underlying securities are held by Busey’s safekeeping agent. Busey may be required to provide additional collateral based on fluctuations in the fair value of the underlying securities.

Term Loan
On May 28, 2021, Busey entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, pursuant to which Busey has access to (1) a $
40.0
 million revolving line of credit with an initial termination date of April 30, 2022, and (2) a $
60.0
 million Term Loan with a maturity date of May 31, 2026. The loans had an annual interest rate of 
1.75
% plus the one-month LIBOR rate. On April 30, 2022, the agreement was amended, effecting an extension of the termination date for the revolving line of credit to April 30, 2023, and providing for the transition from a LIBOR-indexed interest rate to a SOFR-indexed interest rate. Under the terms of the amendment, the annual interest rate for the loans was established at 
1.80
% plus the one-month forward-looking term rate based on SOFR. The agreement has subsequently been amended twice to extend the termination date for the revolving line of credit, which is currently April 30, 2025.
During the first quarter of 2024, Busey paid the full $
30.0
 million balance remaining on the Term Loan, at which time the Term Loan carried interest at a rate of 
7.13
%. As of December 31, 2024, there was 
no
 balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility incurs a non-usage fee based on any undrawn amounts.
Short-Term Borrowings
Busey’s short-term borrowings may include loans maturing within one year of the loan origination date, as well as the current portion of long-term debt that is due within 12 months. 
Short-term borrowings are summarized as follows

Subordinated Notes
On June 1, 2020, Busey issued $
125.0
 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes that mature on June 1, 2030. The subordinated notes, which qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes, bear interest at an annual rate of 
5.25
% for the first 
five years
 after issuance and thereafter bear interest at a floating rate equal to a three-month benchmark rate plus a spread of 
5.11
%, as calculated on each applicable determination date. Interest on the subordinated notes is payable semi-annually on each June 1 and December 1 during the 
five-year
 fixed-term, and thereafter on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2025. The subordinated notes have an optional redemption in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after June 1, 2025. The subordinated notes are unsecured obligations of the Company.
On June 2, 2022, Busey issued $
100.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
5.000
% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes maturing June 15, 2032, which qualify as Tier 2 Capital for regulatory purposes. The price to the public for the subordinated notes was 
100
% of the principal amount of the subordinated notes. Interest on the subordinated notes accrues at a rate equal to (1) 
5.000
% per annum from the original issue date to, but excluding, June 15, 2027, payable semiannually in arrears, and (2) a floating rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be the 
Three-Month Term SOFR
 (as defined in the subordinated notes), plus a spread of 
252
 bps from and including June 15, 2027, payable quarterly in arrears. The subordinated notes have an optional redemption in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after June 15, 2027.
Associated with the M&M acquisition completed on April 1, 2024 (see 
“
Note 2. Mergers and Acquisitions
”
), Busey acquired $
4.0
 million of 
5.25
% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes maturing December 4, 2030, which qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. Interest on the subordinated notes accrues at a rate equal to (1) 
5.25
% per annum from the original issue date to December 4, 2025, and (2) a floating rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be the 
Three-Month Term SOFR
 (as defined in the subordinated notes), plus a spread of 
497
 bps from December 4, 2025. The subordinated notes have an optional redemption, in whole or in part, on or after December 4, 2025. At December 31, 2024, there was $

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 11. JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT OWED TO UNCONSOLIDATED TRUSTS
Busey maintains statutory trusts for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing trust preferred securities and related trust common securities. Proceeds from such issuances were used by the trusts to purchase junior subordinated notes issued by Busey, which are the sole assets of each trust. Concurrent with the issuance of the trust preferred securities, Busey issued guarantees for the benefit of the holders of the trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities are instruments that qualify and are treated as Tier 1 regulatory capital. Busey owns all of the common securities of each trust. The trust preferred securities issued by each trust rank equally with the common securities in right of payment, except that if an event of default under the indenture governing the notes has occurred and is continuing, the preferred securities will rank senior to the common securities in right of payment. Busey had $
74.8
 million and $
72.0
 million of junior subordinated debt owed to unconsolidated trusts at December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, maturing in 2033 through 2036. In connection with its acquisitions of Pulaski Financial Corp. in 2016 and M&M in 2024, Busey has acquired similar statutory trusts and the fair value adjustment is being accreted over their weighted average remaining lives, with a balance of $
2.9
 million and $
2.6
 million remaining to be accreted as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
Busey’s trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the junior subordinated notes at par value at the stated maturity date or upon redemption. Each trust’s ability to pay amounts due on the trust preferred securities is solely dependent upon Busey making payments on the related junior subordinated notes. Busey’s obligations under the junior subordinated notes and other relevant trust agreements, in aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by Busey of each trust’s obligations under the trust preferred securities issued by each trust. Busey has the right to defer payment of interest on the notes, in which case the distributions on the trust preferred securities will also be deferred, for up to 
five years
, but not beyond the stated maturity date.
For regulatory capital purposes, current banking regulations allow for the inclusion in Tier 1 Capital of qualifying trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, by bank holding companies with less than $
15.0
 billion of assets, but do not allow for additional Tier 1 Capital to be raised through the future issuance of trust preferred securities. As of December 31, 2024, 
100
% of the trust preferred securities qualified as Tier 1 Capital; however, once Busey reaches $
15.0
 billion in assets, its trust preferred securities will no longer quality as Tier 1 Capital.
NOTE 12. REGULATORY CAPITAL
First Busey and Busey Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory—and possibly additional discretionary—actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Busey's 
Consolidated Financial Statements
. Capital amounts and classification also are subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
Banking regulations identify five capital categories for insured depository institutions: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, all capital ratios of First Busey and Busey Bank exceeded well capitalized levels under the applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. Management believes that no events or changes have occurred subsequent to December 31, 2024, that would change this designation.

Current Expected Credit Loss Model
On August 26, 2020, the FDIC and other federal banking agencies adopted a final rule which provided banking organizations that adopted CECL during 2020 with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital and to phase in the aggregate impact of the deferral on regulatory capital over a subsequent three-year period. Under this final rule, because Busey elected to use the deferral option, the regulatory capital impact of Busey’s transition adjustments recorded on January 1, 2020, arising from the adoption of CECL was deferred for two years. In addition, 25 percent of the ongoing impact of CECL on Busey’s ACL, retained earnings, and average total consolidated assets from January 1, 2020, through the end of the two-year deferral period, each as reported for regulatory capital purposes, has been added to the deferred transition amounts (“adjusted transition amounts”) and deferred for the two-year period. On January 1, 2022, at the conclusion of the two-year period, the adjusted transition amounts began to be phased-in for regulatory capital purposes at a rate of 25 percent per year, with the phased-in amounts included in regulatory capital at the beginning of each year.

Capital Conservation Buffer
In July 2013, U.S. federal banking authorities approved the Basel III Rule for strengthening international capital standards. The Basel III Rule introduced a capital conservation buffer, composed entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital, which is added to the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is not a minimum capital requirement; however, banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments based on the amount of the shortfall. In order to refrain from restrictions on dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments, banking institutions must maintain minimum ratios of (1) common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%, (2) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (3) total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.
Subsidiary Dividend Payments
First Busey Corporation’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and to service its debt is dependent on the receipt of cash dividends from its subsidiaries. Under applicable regulatory requirements, an Illinois state-chartered bank, such as Busey Bank, may not pay dividends in excess of its net profits. Busey Bank paid $
100.0
 million, $
90.0
 million, and $
95.0
 million in dividends to First Busey Corporation during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

401(k) Plan
Busey provides retirement benefits under its 401(k) Plan. All Busey associates who meet certain age requirements are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan. There is no waiting period for participation in the 401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan is funded primarily through participant contributions via payroll deductions, with two contribution options: (1) the traditional option allows plan participants to elect pre-tax contributions, and (2) the Roth option allows plan participants to elect after-tax contributions. Plan participants may elect to make traditional and/or Roth 401(k) contributions, up to the annual deferral and catch-up limits established by the Internal Revenue Service.
Busey supplements participant contributions by making safe harbor matching and discretionary profit-sharing contributions to the 401(k) Plan.
Safe Harbor Match
Busey makes safe harbor matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan equal to 
100
% of the first 
3
% of eligible participant compensation contributed to the plan and 
50
% of the next 
2
% of eligible participant compensation contributed to the plan. The rights of participants in safe harbor matching contributions vest immediately.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Busey has granted RSU, PSU, and DSU awards under the terms of the 2020 Equity Plan. Upon vesting and delivery, shares are expected, though not required, to be issued from treasury stock. 
A description of RSU, PSU, and DSU awards granted in 2024 under the terms of the 2020 Equity Plan is provided below. A description of RSU, PSU, and DSU awards granted in 2023 and 2022 under the terms of the 2020 Equity Plan can be found in Busey’s Annual Reports for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Busey issued 
163,387
 treasury shares in conjunction with the settlement of RSUs, PSUs, and DSUs in 2024. The difference between the number of shares issued and the number of vested units is due to shares issued under a net share settlement option. There were 
1,326,314
 shares available for issuance under the 2020 Equity Plan as of December 31, 2024.
RSU Awards
Busey grants RSU awards to members of management periodically throughout the year. RSU awards are stock-based awards for which vesting is conditional upon meeting established service criteria. Each RSU is equivalent to 
one
 share of Busey’s common stock. Busey’s RSUs have requisite service periods ranging from 
one year
 to 
five years
, and are subject to accelerated vesting upon eligible retirement from Busey. Recipients earn quarterly dividend equivalents on their respective RSUs, which entitle the recipients to additional units. Therefore, dividends earned each quarter compound based upon the updated unit balances.
On March 20, 2024, under the terms of the 2020 Equity Plan, Busey granted 
189,179
 RSUs to members of management. The grant date fair value of the award was $
4.4
 million, which will be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period ranging from 
one year
 to 
five years
. The terms of these awards included an accelerated vesting provision upon eligible retirement from Busey, after a 
one-year
 minimum requisite service period. Subsequent to the requisite service period, the awards will become 
100
% vested.
On May 22, 2024, under the terms of the 2020 Equity Plan, Busey granted 
12,864
 RSUs to members of management. The grant date fair value of the award was $
0.3
 million, which will be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period of 
three years
. The terms of these awards included an accelerated vesting provision upon eligible retirement from Busey, after a 
one-year
 minimum requisite service period. Subsequent to the requisite service period, the awards will become 
100

PSU Awards
Busey grants PSU awards to members of management periodically throughout the year. PSU awards are stock-based awards for which vesting is conditional upon meeting established performance criteria for the applicable performance period and remaining employed through the end of such performance period. Each PSU is equivalent to 
one
 share of Busey’s common stock. The number of PSUs that ultimately vest will be determined based on the extent to which the established performance criteria are achieved. Busey’s PSUs are subject to accelerated service-based vesting conditions upon eligible retirement from Busey. After performance determination, dividend equivalents are compounded based upon the updated PSU balances at each dividend date during the performance period.
On March 20, 2024, under the terms of the 2020 Equity Plan, Busey granted a target of 
94,604
 PSUs with a maximum award of 
151,366
 units. The actual number of units issued at the vesting date could range from 
0
% to 
160
% of the initial grant, depending on attaining a relative total stockholder return performance goal. The grant date fair value of the award, calculated using the Geometric Brownian Motion Model, was $
2.0
 million, which will be recognized in compensation expense over the performance period ending December 31, 2026.
On March 20, 2024, under the terms of the 2020 Equity Plan, Busey granted a target of 
94,604
 PSUs with a maximum award of 
151,366
 units. The actual number of units issued at the vesting date could range from 
0
% to 
160
% of the initial grant, depending on attaining an adjusted return on average tangible common equity performance goal. The grant date fair value of the award was $
2.2
 million, which will be recognized in compensation expense over the performance period ending December 31, 2026. The actual amount of compensation expense recognized is subject to adjustment based on the extent to which performance goals are expected to be achieved.

DSU Awards
Busey grants DSU awards to its non-employee directors. DSU awards are stock-based awards with a deferred settlement date. Each DSU is equivalent to 
one
 share of Busey’s common stock. DSUs vest over a 
one-year
 period following the grant date. Under the 2020 Equity Plan, DSUs are generally subject to the same terms as RSUs, except that following vesting of DSUs, settlement occurs within 
30
 days following the earlier of separation from the board or a change in control of the Company. After vesting and prior to delivery, DSUs will continue to earn dividend equivalents.

Franchise Tax Matter
In 2021, Busey received an inquiry from the Illinois Secretary Of State, pursuant to which the Illinois Secretary Of State asked for additional information regarding certain of Busey’s franchise tax filings and the calculation of amounts due thereunder. The franchise tax is established by the Illinois Business Corporation Act (“BCA”) 805 ILCS 5/1 et seq., and is a tax imposed on foreign and domestic corporations for the privilege of conducting business in Illinois. Busey has been cooperating with the inquiry and has delivered additional BCA forms requested by the Illinois Secretary Of State, with a full reservation of rights by Busey, including seeking judicial relief, if necessary, with respect to any potential dispute regarding Busey’s preparation of the BCA forms and the calculation of the franchise taxes due. Where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, or the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, as is the case with this matter, no accrual is required. It is reasonably possible that this matter could require Busey to pay additional taxes, including potential penalties and interest, or make other expenditures or accrue liabilities in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated as of December 31, 2024. If the likelihood of potential liabilities elevates, requiring an accrual, the potential future liabilities could be material in the period(s) in which they are recorded.
NOTE 19. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Busey utilizes interest rate swap agreements as part of its asset liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position. Additionally, Busey enters into derivative financial instruments, including interest rate lock commitments issued to residential loan customers for loans that will be held for sale; forward sales commitments to sell residential mortgage loans to investors; and interest rate swaps, risk participation agreements, and foreign currency exchange contracts with customers and other third parties. See

To secure its obligations under derivative contracts, Busey pledged cash and held collateral as follows

Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges
Busey entered into derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges. For a derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in fair value of components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.

Interest Rate Swaps Designated as Cash Flow Hedges
Interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $
500.0
 million as of December 31, 2024, and $
350.0
 million as of December 31, 2023, were designated as cash flow hedges. Busey entered into a $
300.0
 million receive fixed pay floating interest rate swap to reduce Busey's asset sensitivity (“Prime Loan Swap”). Duration was added to Busey’s loan portfolio by fixing a portion of floating prime-based loans. Interest rates had risen above their historical lows allowing Busey to lock in a portion of its loan portfolio to reduce asset sensitivity while creating a more stable margin in a volatile rate market. These hedges were determined to be highly effective during the period, and Busey expects its hedges to remain highly effective during the remaining terms of the swaps. Further, in 2024 Busey entered into forward-starting SOFR-based receive-fixed pay-floating interest rate swaps totaling $
200.0
 million to reduce Busey’s asset sensitivity (“SOFR Loan Swaps”). These hedges were determined to be highly effective during the period, and Busey expects its hedges to remain highly effective during the remaining terms of the swaps. During 2024 an interest rate swap to hedge the risks of variability in cash flows for future interest payments attributable to changes in the 3-month CME Term SOFR benchmark interest rate on Busey’s junior subordinated debt owed to unconsolidated trusts (“Debt Swap”) matured. Changes in fair value were recorded net of tax in OCI.

Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedges
Interest Rate Swaps Not Designated as Hedges
Busey may offer derivative contracts to its customers in connection with their risk management needs. Busey manages the risk associated with these contracts by entering into equal and offsetting derivative agreements with a third-party dealer. These contracts supported variable rate, commercial loan relationships totaling $
719.2
 million and $
663.1
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These derivatives generally worked together as an economic interest rate hedge, but Busey did not designate them for hedge accounting treatment. Consequently, changes in fair value of the corresponding derivative financial asset or liability were recorded as either a charge or credit to current earnings during the period in which the changes occurred.

Risk Participation Agreements
To manage the credit risk exposure related to customer-facing swaps, Busey entered into risk participation agreements in conjunction with loan participation arrangements with other financial institutions. Under these risk participation agreements, Busey purchased credit risk participation, paying an up-front fee to a counterparty to accept a portion of its credit exposure, and will receive a payment from the counterparty if the swap customer defaults on its obligations.
Busey also entered into a risk participation agreement under which Busey sold credit risk participation, receiving an up-front fee from a counterparty in exchange for accepting a portion of the counterparty’s credit exposure. This agreement matured on June 30, 2024. The swap customer did not default on its obligations, and Busey was not required to make a payment to the counterparty of the risk participation agreement.
Notional amounts of the risk participation agreements reflect the participating banks’ pro-rata shares of the derivative instruments, consistent with their shares of the related participated loans. 
The risk participation agreements mature between August 2026 and January 2029, and are summarized as follows

Mortgage Banking Derivatives
Interest Rate Lock Commitments
Interest rate lock commitments that meet the definition of derivative financial instruments under ASC Topic 815 
“Derivatives and Hedging”
 are carried at their fair values in other assets or other liabilities on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
, with changes in the fair values of the corresponding derivative financial assets or liabilities recorded as either a charge or credit to current earnings during the period in which the changes occurred.
Forward Sales Commitments
Busey economically hedges mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments issued to its residential loan customers related to loans that will be held for sale by obtaining corresponding forward sales commitments with an investor to sell the loans at an agreed-upon price at the time the interest rate locks are issued to the customers. Forward sales commitments that meet the definition of derivative financial instruments under ASC Topic 815 
“Derivatives and Hedging”
 are carried at their fair values in other assets or other liabilities on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. While such forward sales commitments generally served as an economic hedge to mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments, Busey did not designate them for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in fair value of the corresponding derivative financial asset or liability were recorded as either a charge or credit to current earnings during the period in which the changes occurred.

Gains or losses are recognized on these mortgage banking derivative instruments in earnings; however, because loans held for sale are carried at LOCOM, any corresponding increase in the fair value of loans held for sale will not be recognized in earnings until the loans are sold, at which time the increase is factored into the calculated gain on sale. Decreases in the market value of loans held for sale is recognized in earnings at each measurement period.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 20. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The fair value of an asset or liability is the price that would be received by selling that asset or paid in transferring that liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction occurring in the principal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) for such asset or liability. ASC Topic 820 
“Fair Value Measurement”
 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
•
Level 1 Inputs
 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
•
Level 2 Inputs
 – Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, volatility, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means.
•
Level 3 Inputs
 – Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.
A description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. These valuation methodologies were applied to Busey’s assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value.
In general, fair value estimates are based upon quoted market prices, when available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated utilizing independent valuation techniques that consider identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable data. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at their estimated fair values. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect, among other things, counterparty credit quality and the company's creditworthiness as well as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time. While management believes Busey's valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to estimate the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Debt Securities Available for Sale
Debt securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value, which is estimated using Level 2 inputs. Busey obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The independent pricing service utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid, and other market information. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the independent pricing service applies available information to prepare evaluations, with a focus on observable market data such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing.
The independent pricing service uses model processes, such as the Option Adjusted Spread model, to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios. Models and processes take into account market conventions. For each asset class, a team of evaluators gathers information from market sources and integrates relevant credit information, perceived market movements, and sector news into the evaluated pricing applications and models.

Contents of Item 8. Financial Statements & Supplementary Data
FIRST BUSEY CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Market inputs that the independent pricing service normally seeks for evaluations of securities, listed in approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data including market research publications. The independent pricing service also monitors market indicators, industry, and economic events. For certain security types, additional inputs may be used or some of the market inputs may not be applicable. Evaluators may prioritize inputs differently on any given day for any security based on market conditions, and not all inputs listed are available for use in the evaluation process for each security evaluation on a given day. Because the data utilized was observable, the securities have been classified as Level 2.
Equity Securities
Equity securities are reported at fair value, which is estimated using Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. Fair value measurements of mutual funds, when held, are estimated using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the measurement date and are classified as Level 1. Fair value measurements of stock use quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active and are classified as Level 2.
Derivative Assets and Derivative Liabilities
Busey’s derivative assets and derivative liabilities are reported at fair value, which is measured using Level 2 or Level 3 inputs. Derivative balances are included in other assets or other liabilities on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
, and consist of interest rate swaps and risk participation agreements where there is no significant deterioration in the counterparties (loan customers) credit risk since origination of the interest rate swap or risk participation agreement, as well as mortgage banking derivatives, including interest rate lock commitments and forward sales commitments.
Fair values of derivative assets and liabilities are estimated based on prices that are obtained from a third-party which uses observable market inputs and, with the exception of risk participation agreements, are classified as Level 2. For purposes of potential valuation adjustments to Busey’s derivative positions, Busey evaluates the credit risk of its counterparties as well as its own credit risk. Accordingly, Busey has considered factors such as the likelihood of default, expected loss given default, net exposures, and remaining contractual life, among other things, in determining if any estimated fair value adjustments related to credit risk are required. Busey reviews counterparty exposure quarterly, and when necessary, appropriate adjustments are made to reflect the exposure. No changes in counterparty credit were identified.
Due to the significance of unobservable inputs, derivative assets related to risk participation agreements are classified as Level 3.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at estimated fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at estimated fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).
Loans Evaluated Individually
Busey does not record portfolio loans at estimated fair value on a recurring basis. However, periodically, a loan is evaluated individually and is reported at the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. If the estimated collateral value is not sufficient, a specific reserve is recorded. Collateral values are estimated using a combination of observable inputs, including recent appraisals, and unobservable inputs based on customized discounting criteria. Due to the significance of unobservable inputs, fair values of individually evaluated collateral dependent loans have been classified as Level 3.
Bank Property Held for Sale
Bank property held for sale represents certain banking center office buildings which Busey has closed and consolidated with other existing banking centers. Bank property held for sale is measured at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell, and is included in premises and equipment, net on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. Fair values were based upon discounted appraisals or real estate listing prices. Due to the significance of unobservable inputs, fair values of all bank property held for sale have been classified as Level 3.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 23. OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION
Busey’s reportable segments are determined by its chief executive officer, Van A. Dukeman, who is the designated chief operating decision maker. Busey is organized into 
three
 reportable operating segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and FirsTech. These operating segments are strategic business units that are separately managed, as they offer different products and services and have different marketing strategies.
To evaluate segment performance and make informed decisions regarding the allocation of capital and personnel to the segments, the chief operating decision maker reviews each segment’s actual revenues, consisting of net interest income plus noninterest income, and net income against budgeted revenues and net income on a monthly basis. This process enables the Company to (1) determine the cost and availability of funds within each business segment, (2) assess the profitability of a specific business segment by aligning relevant costs with revenues, and (3) evaluate each business segment in a way that reflects its economic impact on consolidated earnings.
Banking
The Banking operating segment provides a full range of banking services to individual and corporate customers through First Busey Corporation’s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Busey Bank, with 
62
 banking centers in Illinois; the St. Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area; southwest Florida; and Indianapolis, Indiana.
Banking services offered to individual customers include customary types of demand and savings deposits, money transfers, safe deposit services, individual retirement accounts and other fiduciary services, automated teller machines, and technology-based networks, as well as a variety of loan products including residential real estate, home equity lines of credit, and consumer loans. Banking services offered to corporate customers include commercial, CRE, real estate construction, and agricultural loans, as well as commercial depository services such as cash management.
Wealth Management
The Wealth Management operating segment provides a full range of asset management, investment, brokerage, fiduciary, philanthropic advisory, tax preparation, and farm management services to individuals, businesses, and foundations. Services are provided through Busey Capital Management, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Busey Bank, and Busey Wealth Management, a division of Busey Bank.
Wealth management services tailored to individuals include trust and estate advisory services and financial planning. Business services include business succession planning and employee retirement plan services. Services for foundations include investment strategy consulting and fiduciary services.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
An evaluation of Busey’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, was carried out as of December 31, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and several other members of senior management. Based on this evaluation, Busey’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, Busey’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information Busey is required to disclose in the reports Busey files or submits under the Exchange Act was (1) accumulated and communicated to Busey’s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (2) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
During the three months ended December 31, 2024, no change occurred in Busey’s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Busey’s internal control over financial reporting.
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Busey’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Busey’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of Busey’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Busey’s 
Consolidated Financial Statements
 for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As of December 31, 2024, management assessed the effectiveness of Busey’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework,” issued by the COSO in 2013. Based on this assessment, management determined that Busey maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of First Busey Corporation and Subsidiaries
Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited First Busey Corporation and Subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
