Liquidity Requirements
Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which bank assets may be converted to meet financial obligations to pay deposits or other funding sources. Banks are required to implement liquidity risk management frameworks that ensure they maintain sufficient liquidity, including a cushion of unencumbered, high quality, liquid assets to withstand a range of stress events. The level and speed of deposit outflows contributing to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank in the first half of 2023 was unprecedented and contributed to acute liquidity and funding strain on the financial industry. These events have further underscored the importance of liquidity risk management and contingency funding planning by insured depository institutions like Busey Bank, as highlighted in a 2023 addendum to interagency guidance on funding and liquidity risk management.
