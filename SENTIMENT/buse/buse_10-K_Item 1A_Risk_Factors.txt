Item 1A. Risk Factors
Damage resulting from negative publicity could harm Busey’s reputation and adversely impact its business and financial condition.
Busey’s ability to attract and retain customers, investors, and employees is contingent upon maintaining trust. Negative public opinion could result from the Company’s actual or alleged conduct in a number of activities, including, but not limited to, employee misconduct, failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, faulty lending practices, compliance failures, security breaches, corporate governance, sharing or inadequate protection of customer information, failure to comply with laws or regulations, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct.
The CrossFirst merger further underscores the importance of preserving a positive reputation during this period of transformation. Mergers often attract heightened scrutiny from regulators, investors, and the public, amplifying the potential for reputational risks. Missteps in integration, such as service disruptions, a perceived decline in quality, or employee dissatisfaction could adversely impact public perception.
The results of such actual or alleged misconduct or missteps could include customer dissatisfaction, inability to attract potential acquisition prospects, litigation, and heightened regulatory scrutiny. These outcomes may lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs, and harm to Busey’s reputation. Despite the cost or efforts made by the Company to address issues arising from reputational harm, there is no assurance that these efforts could fully mitigate adverse impacts on Busey’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence technologies introduces operational vulnerabilities.
The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence technologies introduces a range of operational risks, including intellectual property disputes, compliance challenges, and data privacy concerns. The use of artificial intelligence in fraud schemes, such as impersonation attacks and social engineering, underscores the urgency of proactive governance.
Busey remains committed to addressing these risks through advanced technological tools, regular assessments, and collaboration with industry peers to stay ahead of evolving threats.

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY
Busey maintains a cyber security risk management program designed to prevent, detect, and respond to information security threats. The program is designed to align with the Cyber Risk Institute’s Profile framework, which is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Cybersecurity Framework. 
The program is led by Busey’s 
Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”)
.

Busey’s CISO has been in the role since September 2020 and has over 15 years of experience across external and internal audit, technology risk management, and cybersecurity matters, spanning various industries primarily within the financial services sector, but also including healthcare, technology, consumer products, and manufacturing for both regional and multinational corporations.
 Busey’s cyber security risk management program is a key part of the Company’s overall risk management system, which is administered by the Chief Risk Officer.
Busey’s cyber security risk management program includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to help ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. Busey has long devoted significant resources to assessing, identifying, and managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats, including:
•
Establishing an internal cybersecurity team that is responsible for conducting regular assessments of Busey’s information systems, existing controls, vulnerabilities, and potential improvements;

Performing due diligence with respect to 
third-party service providers
, including their cybersecurity practices, and requiring contractual commitments from Busey’s service providers to take certain cybersecurity measures;
•
Ongoing monitoring and assessment of third-party vendors' cybersecurity practices, including regular audits, compliance checks, and incident reporting requirements;
•
Engaging third-party cybersecurity consultants, who conduct periodic penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and other procedures to identify potential weaknesses in Busey’s systems and processes;
•
Mandating periodic cybersecurity training for Busey’s workforce, which includes awareness programs on phishing, social engineering, and other common cyber threats;
•
Implementing access control measures such as multi-factor authentication, role-based access controls, and regular access reviews to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to critical systems and data;
•
Using data encryption for both data at rest and data in transit to protect sensitive information; and
•
Creating an incident response plan that outlines the steps to contain, mitigate, and remediate the impact of cybersecurity incidents, including communication protocols and post-incident analysis.
Busey’s security and privacy policies and procedures are in effect across all of its businesses and geographic locations.
 Busey adheres to various regulatory requirements and standards, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to ensure compliance with data protection laws. Additionally, Busey maintains cybersecurity insurance coverage to mitigate potential financial impacts from cyber incidents.
Busey’s 
board of directors
, as a whole and through its Enterprise Risk Committee (the “Risk Committee”), is responsible for the oversight of risk management.
 In that role, Busey’s board of directors and Risk Committee, with support from Busey’s cybersecurity advisors, are responsible for ensuring that the risk management processes developed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. 
To carry out those duties, both the board of directors and the Risk Committee receive quarterly reports from Busey’s management team regarding cybersecurity risks, and Busey’s efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate any cybersecurity incidents.
Busey’s historical data indicates that while Busey has encountered cybersecurity threats and incidents, none have materially affected the Company.
 Still, Busey faces a number of cybersecurity risks in connection with its business, and it is possible that threats and incidents identified in the future could have a material adverse effect on Busey’s business strategy, results of operations, and financial condition.
