Overview

Repligen Corporation is a global life sciences company that develops and commercializes highly innovative bioprocessing technologies and systems that increase efficiencies and flexibility in the process of manufacturing biological drugs.

As the overall market for biologics continues to grow and expand, our primary customers – global biopharmaceutical companies, contract development and manufacturing organizations and other life science companies (integrators) – face critical production cost, capacity, quality and time pressures. Built to address these concerns, our products help set new standards for the way biologics are manufactured. We are committed to inspiring advances in bioprocessing as a trusted partner in the production of critical biologic drugs – including monoclonal antibodies (“mAbs”) and mAb derivatives, recombinant proteins, RNA-based therapeutics and vaccines, and cell and gene therapies (“C&GT”) – that are improving human health worldwide. Increasingly, our technologies are being implemented to overcome challenges in processing plasmid DNA (a starting material for the production of mRNA) and gene delivery vectors such as lentivirus and adeno-associated viral vectors.

We currently operate as one bioprocessing business, with a comprehensive suite of products to serve both upstream and downstream processes in biological drug manufacturing.  Building on over 40 years of industry expertise, we have developed a broad and diversified product portfolio that reflects our passion for innovation and the customer-first culture that drives our entire organization. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to maximize the value of our product platform through both organic growth initiatives (internal innovation and commercial leverage) and targeted acquisitions.

Our corporate headquarters are located in Waltham, Massachusetts, with additional administrative and manufacturing operations worldwide. A majority of our 16 manufacturing sites are located in the United States (California, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and New York). Outside the United States, we have manufacturing sites in Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Taiwan.

Our Products

Our bioprocessing business is comprised of four main franchises: Filtration (including Fluid Management); Chromatography; Process Analytics; and Proteins.

Since 2012, we have purposely built a highly diversified portfolio of products offered under these franchises, developing high-value technologies that enable more efficient drug manufacturing processes for our customers, through internal research and development (“R&D”) programs and strategic acquisitions. We are committed to sustainable innovation and have earned a reputation as an innovation leader in bioprocessing. We have consistently introduced disruptive new products that solve for specific bioprocessing challenges faced by customers. Our growth strategy continues to expand our geographic scope and customer base and broaden the applications of our technologies.

To support our sales goals for these products, we make ongoing investments in our commercial organization, our R&D programs, our business systems and our manufacturing capacity. We regularly evaluate and invest in these areas as needed to ensure timely deliveries and to stay ahead of customer demand for our products.

2

The majority of our revenue is derived from consumable and/or single-campaign (“single-use”) product sales, as compared to associated hardware and equipment. The customization, scalability and plug-and-play convenience of these products, and in many cases the closed nature of our technologies, make them ideal for use in biologics manufacturing processes where contamination risk is a critical concern of our customers.

Shifting to Integrated Solutions

Since 2012, and through year end 2024, we have completed 14 acquisitions across our four franchises, building a base of technology assets that we can improve upon and/or develop next-generation versions of through our internal R&D team. Our acquisition strategy is purposeful, considering the potential for integration with our internally-developed technologies, and across products and franchises.

In 2024, the results of our mergers and acquisitions and R&D efforts are reflected in our ability to offer more integrated solutions across the bioproduction workflow. Our commercial approach is shifting from “individual product” to “whole system” sales that can support entire unit operations, the management of fluids between unit operations, and in-line advanced analytics. For example, providing filtration systems for production and harvest steps (upstream), and connecting those to chromatography and filtration systems for purification and formulation steps (downstream).

Key Products Within Each of Our Franchises

FILTRATION

Filtration is our largest franchise with the broadest product offering covering upstream and downstream technologies. Below is a description of some of our key products:

XCell ATF
® 
Cell Retention Systems

Our filtration products offer a number of advantages to manufacturers of biologic drugs and are used in process development and process scale (clinical and commercial) production. Our XCell ATF systems are used in upstream perfusion (continuous) and N-1 (intensified fed-batch or hybrid perfusion) cell culture processing.

XCell ATF is a cell retention technology. The system is comprised of an advanced hollow fiber (“HF”) filtration device, a low shear pump and a controller. The XCell ATF system is connected to a bioreactor and enables the cell culture to be run continuously, with cells being retained in the bioreactor, fresh nutrients (cell culture media) being fed into the reactor continuously, and clarified biological product and cell waste being removed (harvested) continuously. The cells are maintained in a consistent nutrient-rich environment and can reach cell densities two- and three-times higher than those achieved by standard fed-batch culture. As a result, product yield is increased, which improves facility utilization and can reduce the size of a bioreactor required to manufacture a given volume of biologic drug product. XCell ATF systems are available in a wide range of sizes that can easily scale from laboratory use through full production with bioreactors as large as 5,000 liters.

In 2023, we introduced next-generation XCell
®
 Large-Scale controllers, enabling increased process intensification through dual-operation of two ATF devices from a single controller, and through advanced monitoring and control of flow rates with smart sensor technology. Our ATF large-scale controllers are designed for scalability from bench top to commercial manufacturing, and for versatility of applications, including perfusion and modified fed-batch (N-1) manufacturing.

Tangential Flow Filtration Consumables

Our TangenX
®
 product portfolio includes flat sheet (“FS”) tangential flow filtration (“TFF”) cassettes that are used primarily in downstream, ultrafiltration processes, e.g., biologic drug concentration, buffer exchange and formulation processes, our single-use SIUS
®
 line, including our reusable PRO line of cassettes, providing customers with a high-performance, cost saving alternative to other companies' TFF cassette offerings and our TangenX SC Device, the industry's first holder-free, self-contained (“SC”) TFF device, which was launched in November 2023.

TFF is a rapid and efficient method for the concentration and formulation of biomolecules that is widely used in many applications in biopharmaceutical development and manufacturing. Our TangenX FS TFF cassettes feature high performing-membrane chemistries

3

that offer superior selectivity for a wide range of applications. A controlled manufacturing process that balances flux and selectivity delivers maximum flux for increased productivity and tight control of the membrane pore size for enhanced selectivity and recovery. Each single-use cassette is delivered pre-sanitized and ready to be equilibrated and used for tangential flow, ultrafiltration and diafiltration applications.

Use of SIUS TFF cassettes eliminates non-value-added steps (cleaning, testing between uses, storage and flushing) that are required with reusable TFF products, providing cost and time savings. For process economics requiring reusable cassettes, TangenX PRO cassettes are available with the same high performance membranes used in SIUS cassettes. Our TangenX cassettes are interchangeable with filter hardware from multiple manufacturers, simplifying customer trial and adoption. In 2020, we introduced SIUS Gamma single-use device, which we engineered to harness the performance and efficiencies of TangenX SIUS membranes and cassettes, while also providing the convenience of a fully assembled, aseptically closed and gamma-irradiated, sterile device. The device is delivered as a single unit composed of the cassette, fluid manifold, clamps, tubing and aseptic connectors. The SIUS Gamma device is ideal for adenovirus C&GT and other processes where large volumes need to be concentrated in a sterile, closed environment.

Our TangenX
®
 SC Device simplifies and streamlines downstream flat sheet UF/DF processes by reducing set up time by 80%, eliminating holders and torquing requirements which reduces the risk of product loss caused by changes in compression or cassette misalignment during installation, allowing users to seamlessly transition from traditional cassettes and reducing bioburden risk and enhancing safety because it is aseptically closed and gamma irradiated and isolates operators from potentially hazardous materials.

Tangential Flow Filtration Systems: KrosFlo
® 
TFF

Our KrosFlo systems for TFF combine significant configurability with premium quality manufacturing. Our TFF systems are designed for scalability from small to large (up to 5,000 liters) volumes, flexibility between HF and FS filter formats, and the ability to use the same system in different unit operations while deploying ready-to-use application-specific flow paths.

Our KrosFlo TFF systems are turnkey solutions for TFF, offered with either TangenX FS cassettes or with our HF filters.

KrosFlo
®
 Flat Sheet TFF Systems

Our 2020 acquisition of ARTeSYN Biosolutions Holdings Ireland Limited (“ARTeSYN”) enabled us to develop and market KrosFlo RS TFF systems that integrate our consumable and equipment offering, providing greater convenience and efficiency for our customers.

We launched our KrosFlo RS 20 series systems in 2022, focusing their use in mRNA and C&GT therapy applications, where they are used primarily in downstream formulation. These responsive TFF systems completely automate sanitization, concentration and product recovery processes. The combination of injection molded tubing, over-molded connectors and valve blocks significantly lowers product hold-up volume to maximize product recovery. With the same software, hardware, controls and cGMP compliance built into every system, and with pre-assembled flow kits for error-free installation, the KrosFlo RS platform offers operational simplicity that can easily be scalable from lab- through production-scale use. KrosFlo FS systems integrate over 10 components with specifications to process volumes between 140 milliliters and 500 liters.

KrosFlo
®
 Hollow Fiber TFF Systems

Our filtration business is strengthened by a leading portfolio of Spectrum
® 
HF filtration solutions, including fully integrated KrosFlo TFF systems with Konduit automated process monitoring and ProConnex
®
 Flow Path single-use assemblies. The KrosFlo family of HF TFF systems integrate multiple components with specifications to process volume between 2 milliliters and 5,000 liters – from lab-scale through commercial manufacturing.

In early 2023 we introduced our RS 30 series of KrosFlo TFF systems, featuring increased automation capabilities. The RS 30 series systems integrate a single-use tulip tank re-circulation vessel, which allows for dynamic control and response to changing fluid levels for maximum product recovery in fed-batch, batch concentration and diafiltration processes. The cGMP compliant, fully automated 1/2 inch single-use TFF system delivers outstanding performance in a small footprint. In alignment with our integrated systems strategy, the system includes ProConnex flow paths to integrate advanced fluid management technologies including overmolded

4

connections, pump heads, tubing filters and sensors in a single-use device. Flow paths easily attach to the system to simplify operation and increase process efficiency.

KrosFlo
®
RPM
™
 Systems with integrated CTech™ FlowVPX
® 
Technology

In 2022, we completed the development of a hollow fiber system that combines KrosFlo TFF with CTech FlowVPX Real-Time Process Management (“RPM”
®
) technology, enabling “walk-away automation” of downstream UF/DF processes. Toward the end of 2022, we launched KrosFlo KR2i RPM for low-volume, high concentration applications. This was the first-to-market TFF system to incorporate real-time process monitoring for in-line protein concentration management. By coupling KrosFlo TFF and FlowVPX functionality, customers can benefit from improved process control and efficiency, while reducing process risk by ensuring accurate concentration throughout the TFF process.

KrosFlo RPM systems monitor concentration during UF/DF runs without having to depend on mass inputs and off-line fixed pathlength UV-Vis spectrophotometers. Risk is further mitigated with fully enclosed ProConnex custom flow paths as a part of the automated TFF process.

Since the debut of the KrosFlo KR2i RPM (2 mL-15L) system, we expanded the KrosFlo RPM offering, introducing KrosFlo FS-15 RPM (150mL-15L) toward the end of 2023. In 2024 we introduced KrosFlo RS-10 – the first bench sacle TFF system built specifically for cGMP production, with end-to-end automation.

The KrosFlo RPM Sytems  portfolio continues to expand to cover a wide range of volumes from lab-to production-scale requirements. We believe KrosFlo RPM solutions provide key process insights to users to reduce cycling time and minimize batch risks, both highly value attributes for bioprocessing users.

Tangential Flow Depth Filtration Systems: KrosFlo
®
 TFDF
®

Our KrosFlo® TFDF® systems are a unique technology that combines the benefits of both tangential flow and depth filtration, simplifying and intensifying upstream perfusion for viral vector production for Cell and Gene Therapy. Combining advanced control hardware, novel high-throughput tubular depth filters, and ProConnex® TFDF® flow paths, the system offers high flux, superior capacity, and low turbidity. Integrated sensors streamline validation, while low hold-up volume, high recovery, and a small footprint reduce processing time and simplify setup. TFDF technology provides a scalable, efficient technology to increase viral vector production.

Strengthening our Filtration Franchise through Acquisitions

With our acquisition of Polymem S.A. (“Polymem”) on July 1, 2021, we further expanded our HF membrane and module production capabilities and added core R&D, engineering and production expertise in HF technology for both industrial and bioprocessing markets. The Polymem business complements our Spectrum HF product line, which includes KrosFlo HF TFF systems and ProConnex fluid management. The acquisition of Polymem accelerated our HF manufacturing buildout and added a Europe-based HF manufacturing center of excellence.

With our acquisition of BioFlex Solutions LLC (“BioFlex”) and Newton T&M Corp. (“NTM”) on December 16, 2021, we complemented and expanded our filtration franchise, as both BioFlex and NTM focus on single-use fluid management components, including single-use clamps, adapters, end caps and hose assemblies. These products are essential components in our upstream and downstream product offerings – especially our systems with line-sets and flow paths. These acquisitions streamline and increase our control over many components in our single-use supply chain, which ultimately should drive reduced lead-times for our customers in the coming years.

We acquired FlexBiosys, Inc. (“FlexBiosys”) on April 17, 2023, further complementing and expanding our fluid management portfolio of offerings with its expert design and custom manufacturing of single-use bioprocessing products and a comprehensive range of products that include bioprocessing bags, bottles, and tubing assemblies.

With our acquisition of Metenova Holding AB (“Metenova”) on October 2, 2023, we strengthened our fluid management portfolio with the addition of magnetic mixing and drive train technologies that are widely used by global biopharmaceutical companies and contract development and manufacturing organizations.

5

The growth of our filtration business has allowed us to substantially increase our direct sales presence in Europe and Asia and diversify our end markets to include all biologic classes, including mAbs, vaccines, recombinant proteins and C&GT.

CHROMATOGRAPHY

Our chromatography franchise includes a number of products used in downstream purification, development, manufacturing and quality control of biological drugs. The main driver of growth in this portfolio is our OPUS
®
 pre-packed column (“PPC”) product line.

In addition to OPUS, with our acquisition of ARTeSYN in 2020, we added chromatography systems to our offerings, providing greater flexibility and market opportunity as we scale and expand our systems portfolio.

Additional chromatography products include our ELISA test kits, used by quality control departments to detect and measure the presence of leached Protein A and/or growth factor in the final product. Our chromatography ligand and resin products are part of our Proteins portfolio.

OPUS Pre-Packed Columns

Our chromatography franchise features a wide range of OPUS columns, which we deliver to our customers sealed and pre-packed with their choice of resin. These are single-use or campaign-use disposable columns that replace the use of customer-packed glass columns for downstream purification. By designing OPUS columns to be a technologically advanced and flexible option for the purification of biologics from process development through clinical and commercial-scale manufacturing, Repligen has become a leader in the PPC market. Our biomanufacturing customers value the significant cost savings that OPUS columns can deliver by reducing set up time, labor, equipment and facility costs – in addition to delivering product consistency and “plug-and-play” convenience.

We launched our first production scale OPUS columns in 2012 and have since added larger diameter options that scale up to use with 2,000 liter bioreactors. Our OPUS 80R column is the largest available PPC on the market for use in late-stage clinical or commercial purification processes. We offer unique features such as a resin recovery port on our larger columns, which allows our customers to remove and reuse the recovered resin in other applications. We believe the OPUS 5-80R product line is the most flexible product line available in the market, serving the purification needs of customers manufacturing mAbs and other biologics such as vaccines and C&GT.

In addition to our larger scale OPUS columns, our portfolio includes our smaller-scale OPUS columns, including our RoboColumn
®
, MiniChrom
®
 and ValiChrom
®
 columns used for process development (“PD”) and validation. These columns are used in high-throughput PD screening, viral clearance validation studies and scale down validation of chromatography processes.

We maintain customer-facing and manufacturing centers in both the United States and Europe for our OPUS column customers, and offer a premier ability to pack any of hundreds of chromatography capture resins available, as per our customers’ choice.

KRM
™ 
Chromatography Systems

Through our acquisition of ARTeSYN in 2020, we gained state-of-the-art, configurable chromatography systems that can integrate a wide range of hardware, components and consumable products to simplify bioprocessing operations for our customers.  Our KRM chromatography systems are precision engineered for high product recovery (low hold-up volumes), high bioactivity (less stress on the product of interest) and reduced risk of deviation (simple changeovers and pre-assembled flow kits). The KRM systems contain closed single-use flow paths (less risk of contamination and product loss) and other advanced fluid management technologies (over-molded connectors, pump heads, filters and pressure sensors), intuitive software and our process analytics technology enabled.

PROCESS ANALYTICS

Our process analytics products complement and support our filtration, chromatography and proteins franchises as they allow end-users to make at-line or in-line absorbance measurements allowing for the determination of protein concentration in filtration, chromatography formulation and fill-finish applications.

6

SoloVPE
®
 Device

Our SoloVPE slope spectroscopy system is the industry standard for offline and at-line absorbance measurements for protein concentration determination in process development, manufacturing and quality control settings.

FlowVPE
® 
Device

Our FlowVPE slope spectroscopy system enhances the power of slope spectroscopy and provides in-line protein concentration measurement for filtration, chromatography and fill-finish applications. A key benefit of this in-line solution is the ability to monitor a manufacturing process in real time.

FlowVPX
®
 System

FlowVPX slope spectroscopy system is our next-generation FlowVPE launched at the beginning of 2021 and designed to meet the rigors of regulatory GMP requirements. FlowVPX offers reliable real-time results with integrated ease for concentration measurements during every stage of the downstream GMP-compliant production-scale biologics manufacturing.

Use of slope spectroscopy systems delivers multiple process benefits for our biopharmaceutical manufacturing customers, compared to traditional UV-Vis approaches. Key benefits include: the elimination of manual dilutions and sample transfers from process development/manufacturing to labs, rapid time to results (minutes versus hours), improved precision, built-in data quality for improved reporting and validation, and ease of use.

KrosFlo
®
 RPM
™
 Systems with integrated FlowVPX
® 
Technology

In 2022, we completed the development of a hollow fiber system that combines KrosFlo TFF with CTech FlowVPX Real-Time Process Management (“RPM”
®
) technology, enabling “walk-away automation” of downstream UF/DF processes. See more about KrosFlo RPM systems under “FILTRATION”,  page 5.

Culpeo
® 
QCL-IR Liquid Analyzer

Pursuant to a 15-year license agreement that we entered into with DRS Daylight Solutions, Inc. (“Daylight”) in September 2022, we obtained the exclusive right to use Daylight's quantum cascade laser technology (“QCL”), including its Culpeo
® 
QCL-IR Liquid Analyzer (“Culpeo”) specifically in the field of bioprocessing. In November 2024, the Company amended the Daylight license agreement to extend the License Agreement one additional year. Culpeo is a compact, intelligent spectrometer that uses the power of QCL to analyze and identify chemicals. Our in-licensing of these rights complements our existing process analytics franchise. Adding mid-IR (higher sensitivity QCL-IR) to UV spectroscopy, we believe this will serve to accelerate and expand adoption of off-line and in-line process monitoring in the bioprocessing industry. Additionally, we are focused on expanding the QCL portfolio, with plans to integrate these solutions into our chromatography and filtration systems.

PROTEINS

Our proteins franchise is represented by our affinity ligands and resins used to purify a wide range of biological drugs including monoclonal antibodies and new modalities.   Our proteins franchise also includes cell culture growth factor products, which are a key component of cell culture media used in upstream bioprocessing to increase cell density and improve product yield.

Protein A Affinity Ligands

Protein A ligands are the essential “binding” component of Protein A affinity chromatography resins used in the purification of virtually all mAb-based drugs on the market or in development. Historically, we manufactured multiple forms of Protein A ligands under long-term supply agreements with major life sciences companies including Cytiva (a standalone operating company owned by Danaher Corporation), MilliporeSigma and Ecolab Life Sciences (“Ecolab”) for their Purolite (“Purolite”) resin business. These life sciences companies  in turn sell their  chromatography resins to end users (pharmaceutical developers and manufacturers).  Cytiva has fully transitioned to in-house manufacturing for their ligand needs, however we continue to manufacture our ligands for integrators including Purolite.

Our Affinity Ligand Collaborations

7

In June 2018, we entered into an agreement with Navigo Proteins GmbH (“Navigo”) for the exclusive co-development of multiple affinity ligands for which Repligen holds commercialization rights. We manufacture and exclusively supply the first of these ligands, NGL-Impact® A, to Purolite, for use with their Purolite™  Praesto™ Jetted A50 Protein A resin product.

In September 2021, the Company and Navigo successfully completed co-development of a novel affinity ligand that addresses aggregation issues associated with pH sensitive antibodies and Fc-fusion proteins. We are manufacturing and supplying this ligand, NGL-Impact® HipH, to Purolite. We have a long-term supply agreement with Purolite for NGL-Impact and potential additional affinity ligands that may advance from our Navigo collaboration.

Our Purolite Agreement

In October 2022, we extended our long-term supply agreement with Purolite Purolite through 2032 and broadened its scope to include affinity ligands targeting antibody fragments in addition to those targeting mAbs and Fc-fusion proteins. This extension and product line expansion aligns with our Proteins strategy and supports the acceleration in market adoption of the Praesto® affinity resin portfolio. It provides Purolite with exclusive access to mAb fragment ligands developed at Avitide, Inc. (“Avitide”), in addition to the NGL portfolio developed at Navigo. Repligen will continue to receive access to Purolite's leading-edge base bead technology, as we proceed with the development and commercialization of novel affinity resins focused on new modalities and C&GT.

In 2024, the Company and Ecolab announced the commercial launch of Praesto® CH1, a cross-linked agarose-based affinity resin designed to purify specialized mAbs such as bispecific antibodies and recombinant antibody fragments. This resin utilizes mAb fragment ligands developed at Avitide, and provides an alternative for the purification of antibody variants when Protein A resins are not suitable.

Adeno-Associated Virus Affinity Ligands and Resins from Avitide

In September 2021, we completed our strategic acquisition of Avitide, a market leader in affinity ligand discovery and development. This acquisition was a major step forward in building our proteins franchise, moving Repligen into affinity resin solutions for C&GT and other emerging modalities.

In February 2022, we launched three advanced affinity chromatography resins for use in gene therapy manufacturing workflows. The resins AVIPure®-AAV9; AVIPure®-AAV8; and AVIPure®-AAV2, were developed by Avitide and are specific to the major adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) C&GT vectors used today. AAV vectors are the leading platform for gene delivery for the treatment of a variety of human diseases. In 2023, a new affinity resin for AAV5 was also launched, expanding the portfolio.

With our acquisition of Tantti Laboratory Inc. (“Tantti”) on December 2, 2024, we expect to accelerate our expansion into new modality markets with unique, scalable purification solutions for these larger molecule biologics.

In December 2024, we launched AviPure® dsRNA Clear resin, pre-packed in OPUS columns.  The AVIPure dsRNA Clear resin combines Avitide proprietary affinity ligands with Tantt’s Dulocore® base bead technology to improve the purification of mRNA therapeutics and vaccines. This is double stranded RNA resin, the first affinity resin to remove the double stranded RNA impurity from transcribed RNA without heat or solvents.

Growth Factors

Most biopharmaceuticals are produced through an upstream mammalian cell culture process. In order to stimulate increased cell growth and maximize overall yield from a bioreactor, manufacturers often add growth factors, such as insulin, to their cell culture media. Our cell culture growth factor additives include LONG
® 
R
3 
IGF 1, our insulin-like growth factor that has been shown to be up to 100 times more biologically potent than insulin (the industry standard), thereby increasing recombinant protein production in cell culture fermentation applications.

Corporate Information

We are a Delaware corporation with our global headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts. We were incorporated in 1981 and became a publicly traded company in 1986. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “RGEN”. We have approximately 1,800 employees and operate globally with offices and manufacturing sites located at multiple locations in the United

 and our telephone number is (781) 250-0111.

2024 Acquisition

Tantti Laboratory Inc.

On December 2, 2024, the Company's subsidiary, Repligen Sweden AB acquired Tantti Laboratory Inc. (“Tantti”) from the former shareholders of Tantti (“Tantti Seller”) pursuant to a share swap agreement, dated as of July 27, 2024 (such acquisition, the “Tantti Acquisition”), by and among Repligen Sweden AB, the Tantti Seller, and the Company, in its capacity as guarantor of the obligations of Repligen Sweden AB under the Share Purchase Agreement.

Tantti, headquartered in Taoyuan City, Taiwan, has developed a unique portfolio of macroporous chromatography beads to optimize the purification of new modalities including viral vectors, viruses, nucleic acids and other large molecule biologics. The addition of Tantti further strengthens our portfolio in the new modality space.

Our Market Opportunity

Bioprocessing Addressable Market

The global addressable market for bioprocessing products is estimated to be approximately $20 billion of which we estimate Repligen’s addressable market to be approximately $12 billion at year end 2024. This market includes bioprocessing products used to manufacture therapeutic antibodies, recombinant proteins and vaccines, as well as C&GTs.

Monoclonal Antibody Market

Antibody-based biologics alone accounted for approximately $250 billion of global biopharma revenue in 2024. Industry sources project the mAbs market to grow in the range of approximately 8% to 10% annually through 2027, driven by new approvals and expanded clinical uses for marketed antibodies, as well as the emergence of biosimilar versions of originator mAbs. As of December 31, 2024, over 180 mAbs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to treat a wide range of diseases. Biological R&D remains robust, with more than 2,000 active mAb clinical trials ongoing to address a wide range of medical conditions.

In addition to investments in the discovery and development of novel biologic drugs, there has been substantial investment in follow-on products (biosimilars) by generic and specialty pharmaceutical as well as large biopharmaceutical companies. Development of follow-on products accelerated as the first major mAbs came off patent in the European Union and United States. Due to the high cost of biologic drugs, many countries in developing and emerging markets have been aggressively investing in biomanufacturing capabilities to supply lower cost biosimilars for the local markets. For both originator and follow-on biologics manufacturing, Repligen products are well-positioned to enable greater manufacturing flexibility, production yields and lower costs through improved process efficiencies.

New Modalities Markets

New modalities encompass cell and gene therapy, RNA based therapeutics and vaccines, and other non-mAb based biological drugs.  New modalities have emerged in the past few years to become a rapidly growing area of biological drug development, with an estimated global market of greater than $15 billion in 2024, and over 3,000 active clinical trials underway at year-end 2024 according to industry sources. Statements by the FDA are supported by industry reports that estimate annual revenue growth of over 20% for new modalities markets over the next several years. The scientifically advanced therapeutic approaches have unique manufacturing challenges that many of our products can help address. We believe we are well positioned to participate in new modalities production, particularly in the manufacture of plasmids and viral vectors. Within new modalities, market, mRNA-based therapeutic programs have

9

become an area of focus and investment by several large biopharmaceutical companies, following the regulatory approval of mRNA-based vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our Strategy

We are focused on the development, production and commercialization of highly differentiated, technology-leading systems and solutions that address specific pressure points in the biologics manufacturing process and deliver substantial value to our customers. Our products are designed to optimize our customers’ workflow to maximize productivity and we are committed to supporting our customers with strong customer service and applications expertise.

We intend to build on our history of developing market-leading solutions and delivering strong financial performance through the following strategies:

•
Continued innovation
. We plan to capitalize on our internal technological expertise to develop products that address unmet needs in upstream and downstream bioprocessing. We continue to invest in platform and derivative products to support our proteins, filtration, chromatography and process analytics franchises. We plan to strengthen our existing product lines with complementary products and technologies, including fluid management products, that are designed to allow us to provide customers with an integrated, more automated and more efficient manufacturing process on one or more measures including flexibility, convenience, time savings, cost reduction and product yield.   

•
Platforming our products. 
A key strategy for accelerating market adoption of our products is delivery of enabling technologies that become the standard, or “platform,” technology in markets where we compete. We focus our efforts on winning early-stage technology evaluations through direct interaction with the key biomanufacturing decision makers in process development labs. This strategy is designed to establish early adoption of our enabling technologies at key accounts, with opportunity for customers to scale up as the biologic advances to later stages of development and potential commercialization. We believe this approach can accelerate the implementation of our products as platform products, thereby strengthening our competitive advantage and contributing to long-term growth. 

•
Targeted acquisitions
. We intend to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions of innovative technologies and products. We intend to leverage our consolidated balance sheets to acquire technologies and products that improve our overall financial performance by improving our competitiveness in filtration (including fluid management), chromatography or process analytics, or by moving us into adjacent markets with common commercial call points. 

•
Geographical expansion
. We intend to expand our global commercial presence by continuing to selectively build out our global sales, marketing, field applications and services infrastructure. 

•
Operational efficiency
. We seek to expand operating margins through capacity utilization and process optimization strategies designed to increase our manufacturing yields. We plan to invest in systems to support our global operations, optimizing resources across our global footprint to maximize productivity. 

Research and Development

Our R&D activities are focused on developing new high-value bioprocessing products across all of our franchises. We strive to continue to introduce truly differentiated products that address specific pain points in the biologics manufacturing process. Our commitment to innovation is core to the Repligen culture and our success as a company.

Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing strategy supports our objective of strengthening our position as a leading provider of products and services, addressing upstream, downstream and quality control needs of bioprocessing customers in the biopharmaceutical industry.

Our Commercial Team

To support our sales goals for our direct-to-consumer products, we have invested in our commercial organization. Since 2018, we have significantly expanded our global commercial organization from 103, to a commercial team of 334 employees as of December 31, 2024. This includes 273 people in field positions (sales, field applications and field service), 37 people in customer service and 24

10

in marketing. Geographically, 170 members of our commercial team are located in North America, 92 in Europe and 72 in Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions.

Our bioprocess account managers are supported in each region by bioprocess sales specialists with expertise in filtration, chromatography or process analytics, and by technically trained field applications specialists and field service providers, who can work closely with customers on product demonstrations, implementation and support. We believe that this model helps drive further adoption at our key accounts and also open up new sales opportunities within each region.

Ligand Supply Agreements

For our proteins franchise, we are committed to be a partner of choice for our customers with distributor and supply agreements in place with large life sciences companies such as Cytiva, MilliporeSigma and Purolite. The Cytiva Protein A supply agreement relating to our Waltham, Massachusetts facility was amended in September 2021 and pursuant to its amended terms, runs through 2025. Our Protein A amended supply agreement with Purolite was amended in October 2022 and, pursuant to its amended terms, runs through 2032. Our dual manufacturing capability provides strong business continuity and reduces overall supply risk for our ligand customers.

Human Capital

Employees

Repligen performs in a highly competitive industry and recognizes that our continued success hinges upon our ability to attract, develop and retain an inclusive team of talented individuals.  We place high value on the satisfaction and well-being of our employees and operate with fair labor standards and industry-competitive compensation and benefits globally. As of December 31, 2024, we employed 1,778

full-time and part-time employees, a decrease of 5 since December 31, 2023. This total includes 334 employees in our commercial organization (273 field and 61 internal), 260 in engineering and R&D, 612 in manufacturing, 179 in quality, 89 in supply chain roles and 304 in administrative functions. Each of our employees has signed a confidentiality agreement. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have one collective bargaining agreement with two unions that covers 75 employees in Sweden, comprising approximately 4% of our total workforce. We renewed this collective bargaining agreement in March 2023, and it expires at the end of March 2025. In France, 55 employees are under the relevant national and local collective bargaining agreements for metallurgy, comprising approximately 3% of our total workforce.

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics

Repligen is committed to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. This means how we conduct ourselves and our global work is more than just a matter of policy and law; it’s a reflection of our core principles. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics reflects Repligen’s five core principles – (1) trustworthiness, (2) respectfulness, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness and (5) corporate citizenship. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to all Repligen employees, including those who are

11

integrated into the Company through acquisitions. The full text of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on our website and can be found at www.repligen.com.

Inclusive Workforce

Repligen maintains a resolute commitment to fostering an inclusive workplace. We have rigorous, established talent acquisition processes, as well as training and employee engagement resources, including inclusive workforce initiatives, to drive the principles of “belonging” for all employees at all levels of our organization starting with our Board of Directors (“Board”) and our Leadership team.

We believe that our employees should reflect the communities in which we live, work, and serve.  In our hiring practices, we strive to hire the most qualified person for the job by ensuring that qualified, inclusive slates of applicants are identified and considered for all roles within our workforce.  As a result of our ongoing commitment to, and focus on, talent identification, recruitment, hiring, engagement, development, and succession planning, we have been particularly effective in building a strong workforce with a broad and deep talent pipeline.

Employee Engagement and Development

Our goal is to develop and maintain a talented, engaged and inclusive workforce that has a positive impact on our performance and on our customers. We regularly conduct engagement surveys to gain insight on employee perspectives. Additional channels for employee engagement include Company-wide all-hands meetings led by our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and site town halls ran by site leaders. We are committed to colleague recognition, which includes acknowledging, appreciating and celebrating each other's contributions and achievements. Our CEO-led all-hands meetings serve as a platform for CEO awards and platinum awards, which reward and recognize both teams and individual colleagues who have made significant and notable contributions to Repligen's success. We also offer a range of programs to develop our managers and enhance our leadership across the Company. Our professional development efforts are aimed at increasing organizational talent and capabilities as well as identifying and developing potential successors for key leadership positions.

Health, Safety and Well-Being

We actively promote the safety, health and well-being of our employees and end users of our products.  Creating a culture where all employees feel supported and valued is paramount to our corporate mission. Our well-being goals are for employees to physically thrive, flourish mentally and emotionally, be socially connected and achieve financial security. We are proud to provide all of our full time employees in the United States with access to an employee assistance program (“EAP”). Our EAP offers employees and their eligible dependents counseling and well-being resources 24 hours a day, seven days a week by phone, online or via the mobile site. Our environmental health and safety policy advances our vision of zero workplace incidents and our efforts to reduce our environmental impacts.

Repligen Performance System

In 2022, we formalized the Repligen Performance System ("RPS"), to provide the tools and a framework for engaging employees across the organization to continuously improve operational performance, with a focus on product quality, customer lead times, material supply, production costs and sustainability. Through a standard implementation network, all teams were empowered to implement just-do-it process improvements, solve priority problems through stand-up meetings and improve key processes through kaizen events. We believe RPS improved our teams' ability to continuously resolve customer challenges, enhance product quality and improve operational efficiencies. The impact of RPS has been seen in productivity savings, customer lead-time reductions, manufacturing capacity expansions, product quality improvements and significant reductions in manufacturing scrap at several key sites. There are a number of programs setup using RPS over the next twelve months.

Sustainability - Environmental, Social and Governance Matters

Our Commitment to Sustainability

We believe our commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) topics across all our global facilities matters and is an important part of creating long-term business value for all stakeholders. We are deeply committed to corporate responsibility and

12

transparency, and we continue to factor sustainability into our business decisions and integrate its core principles into our daily operations.

In establishing a formal approach to ESG, we joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2020 in support of its Ten Principles related to human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. The actions we have taken while building and implementing our robust ESG strategy demonstrate our long-term commitment to being a responsible global corporate citizen.

In preparation for our initial sustainability report, published in 2021, we formed a Corporate Responsibility Team (“CRT”) with oversight by our Board. The CRT was headed by a member of our operations leadership team and represented multiple disciplines within the organization. We completed our first materiality assessment gleaning insights from internal and external stakeholders, and we established a financial grade ESG software platform to inform current and future ESG-related reporting and decisions.

Together, we are advancing our ESG initiatives at an ambitious pace and taking bold steps to engage stakeholders throughout our upstream and downstream value chain.

Our Reporting Frameworks

We have become an active participant in the sustainability reporting ecosystem through our alignment with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and membership with the United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”), the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) and the International Financial Reporting Standards Sustainability Alliance, which now includes the International Sustainability Standards Board standards. Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) standards and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations. In 2023, we completed our first CDP Climate and CDP Water surveys, and submitted our commitment letter to the Science Based Targets Initiative to develop a greenhouse gas emissions reduction plan aligned with the latest climate science.

With our 2023 sustainability report, “Advancing Impacts,” which was published in December 2024 (the “2023 Sustainability Report”), we continued to disclose against internationally recognized reporting frameworks, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Universal Standard 2021 and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards. We have elevated our formalized reporting commitment by submitting our first Carbon Disclosure Project survey responses for Climate and Water (with 2022 data) using guidance from the GHG Protocol and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Additionally, as a signatory of the UNGC (since 2020),  we also reinforced our commitment to the Ten Principles on human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption and  integrated the seven Sustainable Development Goals identified as most relevant to our business into our reporting.

Oversight of ESG Matters

The Nominating and Corporate Governance (“N&CG”) Committee of our Board oversees our ESG program. The N&CG Committee meets regularly and reviews and advises on ESG strategy and apprises the full Board in order to ensure that our ESG program and strategy align with the Company's mission. In addition, the Audit Committee of the Board regularly reviews ESG-related topics such as enterprise risk management, anti-corruption, ethics and compliance, supply chain management, human rights protections, and cybersecurity and data privacy.

The Head of Sustainability, under strategic direction of our CEO and Chief Operating Officer, is responsible for the development and implementation of our expanding ESG program. In collaboration with all key business functions, the mandate of this globally focused role is to consider our existing ESG initiatives, understand stakeholder perspectives, identify business-relevant areas of opportunity to make a positive impact on global ESG efforts, and work collaboratively to drive initiatives designed to accelerate our ESG progress and stretch our ESG ambition.
