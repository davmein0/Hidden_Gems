Overview

We are a biotechnology company committed to establishing the leading, fully integrated platform for precision genetic medicines. Our vision is to provide life-long cures to patients suffering from serious diseases. To achieve this vision, we have assembled a platform that includes a suite of gene editing and delivery technologies as well as internal manufacturing capabilities.

Our suite of gene editing technologies is anchored by our proprietary base editing technology, which potentially enables a differentiated class of precision genetic medicines that target a single base in the genome without making a double-stranded break in the DNA. This approach uses a chemical reaction designed to create precise, predictable and efficient genetic outcomes at the targeted sequence. Our proprietary base editors have two principal components: (i) a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, or CRISPR, protein, bound to a guide RNA, that leverages the established DNA-targeting ability of CRISPR, but is modified to not cause a double-stranded break, and (ii) a base editing enzyme, such as a deaminase, which carries out the desired chemical modification of the target DNA base. We believe this design contributes to a more precise and efficient edit compared to traditional gene editing methods, with the potential to dramatically increase the impact of gene editing. We are also pursuing a suite of both delivery modalities, including both 
ex vivo 
and 
in vivo
 approaches, depending on tissue type. The elegance of the base editing approach, combined with a tissue specific delivery modality, provides the basis for a targeted, efficient, precise, and highly versatile gene editing system that is designed to be capable of gene correction, gene silencing or gene activation, gene modification, and/or multiplex editing of several genes simultaneously.

Our goal is to advance a broad, diversified portfolio of base editing programs against distinct, genetically validated editing targets, as well as an innovative, platform business model that will expand the reach of our programs to more patients. Overall, we are seeking to build the leading integrated platform for precision genetic medicine, which may have broad therapeutic applicability and the potential to transform the field of precision genetic medicines.

Hematology

We are advancing hematology base editing programs in which hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs, are collected from a patient, edited using electroporation, and then infused back into the patient following a conditioning regimen, such as treatment with busulfan, the standard of care in HSC transplantation, or HSCT, today. Once reinfused, the HSCs begin repopulating a portion of the bone marrow in a process known as engraftment. The engrafted, edited HSCs give rise to progenitor cell types with the corrected gene sequences. We are deploying this 
ex vivo 
approach in our BEAM-101 and ESCAPE base editing programs.

We are pursuing a long-term, staged development strategy for our base editing approach to treat hematological diseases that consists of advancing our lead 
ex vivo
 program, BEAM-101, in Wave 1, improving patient conditioning regimens in Wave 2, and enabling 
in vivo
 base editing with delivery directly into HSCs of patients via lipid nanoparticles, or LNPs, in Wave 3. We believe this suite of technologies – base editing, improved conditioning and 
in vivo 
delivery for editing HSCs – can maximize the potential applicability of our sickle cell disease programs to patients as well as create a platform for the treatment of many other severe genetic blood disorders.

Wave 1: Ex Vivo Base Editing via Autologous Transplant with BEAM-101

We are using base editing to pursue the development of BEAM-101 for the treatment of sickle cell disease. BEAM-101 is a patient-specific, autologous HSC investigational therapy designed to offer a potentially best-in-class profile, incorporating base edits that are intended to mimic single nucleotide polymorphisms seen in individuals with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, or HbF. BEAM-101 aims to alleviate the effects of sickle cell disease by increasing HbF, which is expected to increase functional hemoglobin production and, in the case of sickle cell disease, inhibit hemoglobin S, or HbS, polymerization.

111

We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of BEAM-101 for the treatment of sickle cell disease, which we refer to as our BEACON trial. The BEACON trial initially includes up to 45 patients ages 18 to 35 with severe sickle cell disease who have received prior treatment with at least one disease-modifying agent with inadequate response or intolerance. Following mobilization, conditioning and treatment with BEAM-101, patients are assessed for safety and tolerability, with safety endpoints including neutrophil and platelet engraftment. Patients are also assessed for efficacy, with efficacy endpoints including the change from baseline in severe vaso-occlusive events, transfusion requirements, HbF levels, and quality of life assessments. In December 2024, we announced preliminary positive data from our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of BEAM-101, which we refer to as the BEACON trial. The adult enrollment target for BEACON has been achieved, and the first adolescent patients have cleared screening and enrolled in the trial. We expect to dose 30 patients in the BEACON trial by mid-2025. We also plan to present updated data from the trial in mid-2025.

Wave 2: Non-genotoxic Conditioning

In parallel with Wave 1 development, we also aim to improve the transplant conditioning regimen for patients undergoing HSCT, thereby reducing toxicity challenges associated with HSCT. Conditioning is a critical component necessary to prepare a patient’s body to receive the 
ex vivo
 edited cells that must engraft in the patient’s bone marrow in order to be effective. However, current conditioning regimens rely on nonspecific chemotherapy or radiation, which are associated with significant toxicities. As a potential alternative to genotoxic conditioning regimens in HSCT, we are advancing our ESCAPE program. ESCAPE aims to avoid toxicity challenges associated with currently available conditioning regimens for patients with sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia ahead of autologous HSCT, by combining antibody-based conditioning with multiplex gene edited HSCs. ESCAPE may also have applications in other diseases of the blood and immune system where HSCT could deliver potential benefits but has been limited by toxicities associated with current standard of care conditioning regimens.

We have nominated a development candidate for our ESCAPE technology comprised of two investigational drug products: BEAM-103, an anti-CD117 monoclonal antibody, and BEAM-104, a cell therapy that includes the same therapeutic edit as BEAM-101 (editing the HBG1/2 genes to elevate fetal hemoglobin), plus an additional edit to CD117 designed to block binding of BEAM-103, allowing the edited cells to evade suppression by the antibody. We intend to advance BEAM-103 and BEAM-104 for development in sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, potentially building on the same regulatory, manufacturing, clinical and commercial foundations being established with BEAM-101. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 healthy volunteer clinical trial of BEAM-103 by the end of 2025.

Wave 3: In Vivo

Base Editing via HSC-targeted LNPs

We are also exploring the potential for 
in vivo
 base editing programs for sickle cell disease, in which base editors would be delivered to the patient through an infusion of LNPs targeted to HSCs, eliminating the need for transplantation altogether. This approach could provide a more accessible option for patients, particularly in regions where 
ex vivo 
treatment is challenging.

Genetic Diseases

BEAM-302: In Vivo

LNP liver-targeting for AATD

BEAM-302 is a liver-targeting LNP formulation of base editing reagents designed to offer a one-time treatment to correct the E342K point mutation (PiZZ genotype) predominantly responsible for the severe form of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or AATD. AATD is an inherited genetic disorder that can cause early onset emphysema and liver disease. The most severe form of AATD arises when a patient has a point mutation in both copies of the SERPINA1 gene at amino acid 342 position (E342K, also known as the PiZ mutation or the “Z” allele). This point mutation causes Alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT, to misfold, accumulating inside liver cells rather than being secreted, resulting in very low levels (10%-15%) of circulating AAT. In addition to resulting in lower levels, the PiZ AAT protein variant is also less enzymatically effective compared to wildtype AAT protein. As a consequence, the lung is left unprotected from neutrophil elastase, resulting in progressive, destructive changes in the lung, such as emphysema, which can result in the need for lung transplants. The mutant AAT protein also accumulates in the liver, causing liver inflammation and cirrhosis, which can ultimately cause liver failure or cancer requiring patients to undergo a liver transplant. It is estimated that approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States have two copies of the Z allele. There are currently no curative treatments for patients with AATD.

We are conducting a Phase 1/2 open label, dose escalation clinical trial of BEAM-302 at sites located in the United Kingdom for the treatment of AATD. The trial will evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of BEAM-302 initially in patients with AATD-associated lung disease. The study design includes a dose exploration portion followed by a dose expansion portion to identify the optimal dose to take forward in a pivotal study. We continue to progress enrollment and global site activation and expect to report initial clinical data from multiple cohorts in the trial in the first half of 2025.

BEAM-301: In Vivo LNP liver-targeting for GSD1a

BEAM-301 is a liver-targeting LNP formulation of base editing reagents designed to correct the R83C mutation, the most prevalent disease-causing mutation for, and the mutation which results in the most severe form of, glycogen storage disease 1a, or GSD1a. GSD1a is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the G6PC gene that disrupts a key enzyme, G6Pase, critical for

112

maintaining glucose homeostasis. Inhibition of G6Pase activity results in low fasting blood glucose levels that can result in seizures and be fatal. Patients with this mutation typically require ongoing corn starch administration, without which they may enter into hypoglycemic shock within one to three hours.

We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of BEAM-301 at a select number of sites in the United States. The trial is an open-label, multi-cohort, single-ascending dose evaluation of BEAM-301 for the treatment of GSD1a in patients with the R83C mutation. Key endpoints of the trial include safety and tolerability, time to hypoglycemia during fasting, and changes from baseline in corn starch supplementation. We are continuing site activation activities and expect dosing to commence in early 2025.

Manufacturing

Due to the critical importance of high-quality manufacturing and control of production timing and know-how, we have established a 100,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina intended to support a broad range of clinical programs. The cGMP facility is designed to support manufacturing for our 
ex vivo

cell therapy programs in hematology and 
in vivo

non-viral delivery programs for liver and liver-mediated diseases, with the capability to scale-up to support potential commercial supply. For our initial clinical trials, we expect to rely primarily on our internal manufacturing capabilities, along with CMOs with relevant manufacturing experience in genetic medicines. We believe this investment will maximize the value of our portfolio and capabilities, the probability of technical success of our programs, and the speed at which we can provide potentially life-long cures to patients.

Financial operations overview

General

We were founded in January 2017 and began operations in July 2017. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to building our base editing platform and advancing development of our portfolio of programs, establishing and protecting our intellectual property, conducting research and development activities, organizing and staffing our company, conducting clinical trials, maintaining and expanding internal manufacturing capabilities, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, proceeds from offerings of our common stock and payments received under collaboration and license agreements.

We are an early-stage company, and the majority of our programs are at a preclinical or clinical stage of development. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. Our revenue to date has been primarily derived from license and collaboration agreements with partners. Since inception we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $376.7 million, $132.5 million and $289.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.6 billion. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses in connection with ongoing development activities related to our internal programs and collaborations as we continue our preclinical and clinical development of product candidates; advance additional product candidates toward clinical development; operate our cGMP facility in North Carolina; further develop our base editing platform; continue to make investments in delivery technology for our base editors; conduct research activities as we seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; maintain, expand, enforce, defend and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and continue to hire research and development, clinical, technical operations and commercial personnel. In addition, we expect to continue to incur the costs associated with operating as a public company.

As a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need to raise additional capital to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We can give no assurance that we will be able to secure such additional sources of capital to support our operations, or, if such capital is available to us, that such additional capital will be sufficient to meet our needs for the short or long term.

Revenue recognition

In April 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Verve Agreement, with Verve Therapeutics, Inc., or Verve, a company focused on gene editing for cardiovascular disease treatments. In June 2021, we entered into a research collaboration agreement, or the Apellis Agreement, with Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Apellis, focused on the use of our base editing technology to discover new treatments for complement system-driven diseases. In October 2021, we entered into an option and license agreement, or the Sana Agreement, with Sana Biotechnology, Inc., or Sana, pursuant to which we granted Sana non-exclusive research and development and commercial rights to our CRISPR Cas12b technology to perform nuclease editing for certain 
ex vivo 
engineered cell therapy programs. In December 2021, we entered into a four-year research collaboration agreement, or the Pfizer Agreement, with Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, focused on 
in vivo
 base editing programs for three targets for rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle and central nervous system. In September 2022, we entered into a License and Research Collaboration Agreement, or the

113

Orbital Agreement, with Orbital Therapeutics, Inc., or Orbital, a newly formed entity focused on advancing non-viral delivery and RNA technologies. In October 2023, we entered into a Transfer and Delegation Agreement, or the Lilly Agreement, with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, pursuant to which Lilly acquired certain assets and other rights under the Verve Agreement, including our opt-in rights to co-develop and co-commercialize Verve’s base editing programs for cardiovascular disease.

We have not generated any revenue to date from product sales and do not expect to do so in the near future. During the years ended

December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized $63.5 million, $377.7 million and $60.9 million respectively, of revenue from our license and collaboration agreements.

For additional information about our revenue recognition policy, see Note 2 and Note 10 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, which include:

•
expenses incurred in connection with our clinical trials, including contract research organization costs and costs related to study preparation;

•
the cost of manufacturing materials for use in our preclinical studies, IND-enabling studies and clinical trials; 

•
expenses incurred in connection with investments in delivery technology for our base editors;

•
expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and preclinical development of our research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations; 

•
personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in research and development functions; 

•
the cost to obtain licenses to intellectual property, such as those with Harvard University, or Harvard, The Broad Institute, Inc., or Broad Institute, Editas Medicine, Inc., or Editas, and Bio Palette Co., Ltd., or Bio Palette, and related future payments should certain success, development and regulatory milestones be achieved; 

•
expenses incurred in connection with the building of our base editing platform;

•
expenses incurred in connection with regulatory filings; 

•
laboratory supplies and research materials; and

•
facilities, depreciation and other expenses which include direct and allocated expenses.

Our external research and development expenses support our various preclinical and clinical programs. Our internal research and development expenses consist of employee-related expenses, facility-related expenses, and other indirect research and development expenses incurred in support of overall research and development. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the benefits are consumed.

In the early phases of development, our research and development costs are often devoted to product platform and proof-of-concept preclinical studies that are not necessarily allocable to a specific target.

We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially as we advance our programs through their planned preclinical and clinical development.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, intellectual property, business development and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services, insurance costs, travel, and direct and allocated facility related expenses and other operating costs.

We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our increased research and development activities. We also expect to continue to incur costs associated with being a public company and maintaining controls over financial reporting, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs, and investor and public relations costs.

114

Other income and expenses

Other income and expenses consist of the following items:

•
Change in fair value of derivative liabilities 
consists primarily of remeasurement gains or losses associated with changes in success payment liabilities associated with our license agreement with Harvard, dated as of June 27, 2017, as amended, or the Harvard License Agreement, the license agreement with The Broad Institute, as amended, dated as of May 9, 2018, or the Broad License Agreement, and settlement payment derivative liabilities associated with a settlement agreement with a research institution.

•
Change in fair value of non-controlling equity investments
 consists of changes in the fair value of our investments in equity securities.

•
Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities 
consists of remeasurement of the fair market value of the technology and product contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisition of Guide.

•
Interest and other income (expense), net
 consists primarily of interest income from our investments in fixed income securities as well as interest expense related to our equipment financings.

License and collaboration revenue

License and collaboration revenue was approximately $63.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to approximately $377.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $314.2 million. License and collaboration revenue recorded in 2024 represents revenue recorded under the Pfizer, Apellis and Orbital Agreements, as well as $27.0 million of revenue recognized from development and regulatory milestones achieved under our agreements with Lilly and Sana. In 2023, we recorded $377.7 million of total revenue, inclusive of license revenue related to the Lilly, Pfizer, Apellis, Orbital and Verve Agreements and $1.8 million of revenue recognized from development and regulatory milestones achieved under our agreements with Sana. The decrease in revenue is driven primarily by $216.4 million of up-front revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2023, from the transaction with Lilly (see Note 10) and the net change in activity amongst our collaboration agreements. Revenue recognized under the Pfizer and Apellis agreements relate to nonrefundable up-front payments and are recognized based upon a measure of progress using total actual costs incurred as compared to total estimated costs.

The decrease of $69.8 million was primarily due to the following:

•
A $39.7 million decrease in external research and development expenses driven by a $29.6 million decrease in outsourced services, primarily due to the strategic reprioritization of pipeline programs, timing of manufacturing spend and fewer IND-enabling activities, partially offset by increased clinical activities. Also contributing to the decrease is a $10.1 million decrease in lab supply expenses due to the strategic reprioritization of pipeline programs and a shift of programs beyond research activities

•
A decrease of $38.8 million in other expense primarily due to decreases of accrued liabilities for estimated license fees associated with the Lilly transaction; and

•
A decrease of $11.1 million of employee related expenses due to the annualized impact of the higher number of research and development employees prior to our strategic restructuring in October 2023 and the severance related to the restructuring.

The decrease was partially offset by the following:

•
An increase of $15.7 million in stock-based compensation from additional stock options and restricted stock units granted during the year; and

•
An increase of $4.0 million of facility and information technology, or IT, related costs, including depreciation and the expense allocated to research and development related to our leased facilities.

Research and development expenses are expected to continue to increase as we advance clinical trials for BEAM-101, BEAM-302, and BEAM-301, continue our current research programs, initiate new research programs, continue the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, conduct any future preclinical studies, and begin to enroll patients in and conduct clinical trials for any of our product candidates.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses were $111.5 million and $116.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of $5.3 million was primarily due to the following:

•
A decrease of $16.9 million attributable to the settlement of a contingent liability;

•
A decrease of $0.4 million in insurance costs; and

•
A decrease of $0.2 million in other expenses.

The decrease was partially offset by the following:

•
An increase of $6.3 million in stock-based compensation from additional stock options and restricted stock units granted during the year; and

•
An increase of $5.9 million in personnel related costs due to an increase in the number of general and administrative employees between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, and increases in salaries and bonuses to existing employees.

116

Change in fair value of derivative liabilities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded $2.3 million of other income related to the change in fair value of the derivative liabilities as compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven primarily by the decline in the price of our common stock. A portion of the success payments was paid in June 2021; the remaining success payment obligations are still outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and will continue to be revalued at each reporting period.

Change in fair value of non-controlling equity investments

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded other expense of $14.1 million and $18.6 million, respectively, as a result of changes in the fair value of our investments in Verve and Prime Medicine common stock.

Change in contingent consideration liabilities

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded $1.6 million and $9.7 million, respectively, of other income related to the change in fair value of the Guide technology and product contingent consideration liabilities as a result of an update in project timelines and the expected probability of achievement of the milestones.

Interest and other income (expense), net

Interest and other income (expense), net was $49.1 million and $46.7 million of other income for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increases in interest income driven by increased market rates and growth of our investment portfolio.

Provision for income taxes

We recorded an income tax provision of less than $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and a provision of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which reflects that we generated taxable income that was not fully offset by the use of tax operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. Our taxable income includes income recognized related to our license and collaboration agreements with Apellis, Pfizer, Lilly, Sana and Orbital in the year ended December 31, 2024. Taxable income in the year ended December 31, 2023 included income recognized related to the Lilly Agreement.

Liquidity and capital resources

Since our inception in January 2017, we have not generated any revenue from product sales, have generated only limited revenue from our license and collaboration agreements, and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and the clinical development of our product candidates.

In February 2024, we filed a universal automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, to register for sale an indeterminate amount of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units in one or more offerings, which became effective upon filing with the SEC (File No. 333-277427).

We have entered into an at the market sales agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, pursuant to which we are entitled to offer and sell, from time to time at prevailing market prices, shares of our common stock having aggregate gross proceeds of up to $1.1 billion. We agreed to pay Jefferies a commission of up to 3.0% of the aggregate gross sale proceeds of any shares sold by Jefferies under the Sales Agreement. There were no shares sold under the Sales Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we have sold 13,769,001 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement at an average price of $62.75 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $864.0 million, before deducting commissions and offering expenses payable by us.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $850.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

We are required to make success payments to Harvard and Broad Institute based on increases in the per share fair market value of our common stock. The amounts due may be settled in cash or shares of our common stock, at our discretion. We may owe Harvard and Broad Institute success payments of up to an additional $90.0 million each.

We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates, and we do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of our product candidates for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we may need to raise additional capital in order to continue to fund our research and development, including our planned preclinical studies and clinical trials, maintaining and operating our commercial-scale cGMP manufacturing facility, and new product development, as well as to fund our general operations. As necessary, we will seek to raise additional capital through various potential sources, such as equity and debt financings or through corporate collaboration and license agreements. We can give no assurances that we will be able to secure such additional sources of capital to support our operations, or, if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs.

Operating activities

Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $347.2 million, including our net loss of $376.7 million, decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $57.7 million, deferred revenue of $36.5 million and operating lease liabilities of $13.0 million, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $5.4 million. In addition, noncash items, including the amortization of investment discounts and premiums of $22.8 million, decreases in the fair value of derivative liabilities of $2.3 million and a change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $1.6 million, also contributed to net cash used in operating activities.

These uses of cash were partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $1.8 million and other long-term liabilities of $0.5 million, as well as noncash items, including stock-based compensation expense of $120.7 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $21.9 million, a decrease in the fair value of non-controlling equity investments of $14.1 million and a decrease in operating lease right-of-use, or ROU, assets of $9.7 million.

Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $149.2 million, including $216.4 million of cash received under the Lilly transaction, increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $67.7 million, as well as noncash items consisting of stock-based compensation expense of $98.6 million, a decrease in the fair value of non-controlling equity investments of $18.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $20.0 million and changes in operating lease ROU assets of $9.5 million.

These sources of cash were offset in part by our net loss of $132.5 million, a decrease in deferred revenue of $159.6 million, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $10.2 million, decreases in accounts payable of $7.6 million, other long-term liabilities of $0.2 million, increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6.5 million and collaborations receivables of $0.1 million, as well as noncash items including amortization of investment discounts and premiums of $29.7 million, decreases in the fair value of derivative liabilities of $7.5 million and a change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities of $9.7 million.

Investing activities

For the year ended December 31, 2024, cash provided by investing activities of $185.0 million was primarily the result of net maturities of marketable securities partially offset by purchases of marketable securities, in addition to purchases of property and equipment of $8.9 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by investing activities of $71.8 million was primarily the net result of maturities of marketable securities partially offset by purchases of marketable securities, in addition to purchases of property and equipment of $33.7 million.

Financing activities

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 of $7.7 million consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $5.6 million and $2.6 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, offset in part by net repayments of equipment financing liabilities of $0.5 million.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 of $276.4 million consisted primarily of proceeds from equity offerings of $236.6 million, net of sales commissions, proceeds from the issuance of shares from the Lilly Agreement of $33.6 million, $6.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and $3.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our ESPP, offset in part by net repayments of equipment financing liabilities of $2.3 million and payment of equity offering costs of $0.6 million.

Funding requirements

Our operating expenses are expected to continue to increase substantially as we continue to advance our portfolio of programs.

Specifically, our expenses will increase if and as we:

•
advance clinical trials of our product candidates;

•
continue our research programs and our preclinical development of product candidates from our research programs; 

•
seek to identify additional research programs and additional product candidates; 

•
initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for additional product candidates we identify and develop; 

•
seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

•
establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval;

•
maintain, expand, enforce, defend, and protect our intellectual property portfolio and provide reimbursement of third-party expenses related to our patent portfolio;

•
further develop our base editing platform; 

•
continue to hire additional personnel including research and development, clinical and commercial personnel; 

•
add operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development; 

•
acquire or in-license products, intellectual property, medicines and technologies; and

•
maintain and operate a commercial-scale cGMP manufacturing facility.

We expect that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at December 31, 2024 will enable us to fund our current and planned operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of our accompanying consolidated financial statements. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we may exhaust our available capital resources sooner that we currently expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development our programs, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with completing the research and development of our product candidates.

Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors including:

•
the cost of continuing to build our base editing platform; 

•
the costs of acquiring licenses for the delivery modalities that will be used with our product candidates; 

•
the scope, progress, results, and costs of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing, manufacturing and clinical trials for the product candidates we may develop; 

•
the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights, and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

•
the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of the product candidates we develop; 

•
the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing, distribution, coverage and reimbursement for any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval; 

•
the success of our license agreements and our collaborations; 

•
our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; 

•
the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration agreements we are a party to or may become a party to, including our agreement with Guide; 

•
the payment of success liabilities to Harvard and Broad Institute pursuant to the respective terms of the Harvard License Agreement and the Broad Institute License Agreement, should we choose to pay in cash;

•
the extent to which we acquire or in-license products, intellectual property, and technologies; 

•
the costs of operating and expanding our manufacturing capacity; and

119

•
the impact on our business of macro-economic conditions, as well as the prevailing level of macro-economic, business, and operational uncertainty, including as a result of geopolitical events or other global or regional events.

A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Further, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of capital. We have historically relied on equity issuances to fund our capital needs and will likely rely on equity issuances in the future. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends.

If we raise capital through additional collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates, or we may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or, if approved, future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. We can give no assurance that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations, or, if such funds are available to us, that such additional funding will be sufficient to meet our needs.

Contractual obligations

We lease certain assets under noncancelable operating leases, which expire through 2037. The leases relate primarily to office space, laboratory and manufacturing space, and equipment. Aggregate future minimum commitments under these office and laboratory leases and equipment leases are $227.7 million as of December 31, 2024, excluding any related common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes.

In May 2021, the first success payment measurements under the Harvard License Agreement and Broad License Agreement occurred and success payments to Harvard and Broad Institute were calculated to be $15.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively. We elected to make each payment in shares of our common stock and issued 174,825 shares of our common stock to each of Harvard and Broad Institute to settle these liabilities in June 2021. The remaining success payment obligations are still outstanding as of December 31, 2024. We may additionally owe Harvard and Broad Institute success payments of up to an additional $90.0 million each.

We are potentially obligated to pay certain milestone and success fees, non-royalty sublicense income fees, royalty fees, licensing maintenance fees, and reimbursement of patent maintenance costs under agreements we have entered into with certain institutions to license intellectual property. Our agreements to license intellectual property include potential milestone payments that are dependent upon the development of products using the intellectual property licensed under the agreements and contingent upon the achievement of development or regulatory approval milestones, as well as commercial and success payment milestones. These amounts are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the timing and likelihood of such potential obligations are not known with certainty.

In addition, we agreed to pay Guide’s former stockholders and optionholders up to an additional $100.0 million in technology milestone payments and $220.0 million in product milestone payments, payable in our common stock valued using the volume-weighted average price of our common stock over the ten-day trading period ending two trading days prior to the date on which the applicable milestone is received. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the timing and likelihood of such potential obligations are not known with certainty.

Additionally, we enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CMOs and other vendors to assist in the performance of our research and development activities and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts.

Critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

120

While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.

Revenue recognition

At inception, we determine whether contracts are within the scope of ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, or ASC 606, or other topics. For contracts that are determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.

Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods and services, we apply judgment to determine whether promised goods and services are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods and services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.

The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method, depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in management’s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Any estimates, including the effect of the constraint on variable consideration, are evaluated at each reporting period for any changes. Determining the transaction price requires significant judgment and is discussed in further detail for each of our license and collaboration agreements in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The consideration to be received is allocated among the separate performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices. Determining the standalone selling price requires significant judgment and is discussed in further detail for each of our license and collaboration agreements in Note 10.

We satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized over time if either (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance, (ii) the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or (iii) the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. If the entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the related performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time by transferring the control of a promised good or service to a customer.

The timing of when services are performed and the occurrence of external costs associated with the programs under the collaboration agreements could impact how revenue is recognized in a certain period.

Licenses of intellectual property, or IP: If the license to our IP is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from consideration allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer can use and benefit from the licenses. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. We generally recognize revenue using the cost incurred to date as compared to the total estimated cost. Changes in estimates of total internal and external costs expected to be incurred and timing of when those costs are expected to be incurred are recognized in the period of change as a cumulative catch-up adjustment. If estimates of the total estimated cost change, or if contract amendments change the scope of the performance obligations, the impacts could be material. Determining the revenue recognition of IP licenses requires significant judgment and is discussed in further detail for each of our license and collaboration agreements in Notes 9 and 10
.

121

Milestone payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes development or regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate the probability of reaching the milestones and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur in the future, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee’s, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received and therefore revenue recognized is constrained as management is unable to assert that a reversal of revenue would not be possible. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. To date, we have not recognized any milestone revenue resulting from any of our agreements.

Commercial Milestone Payments and Royalties: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on levels of sales, if the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of our agreements.

When no performance obligations are required of us, or following the completion of the performance obligation period, amounts are recognized as revenue upon transfer of control of the goods or services to the customer. Generally, all amounts received or due other than sales-based milestones and royalties are classified as license and collaboration revenue. Sales-based milestones and royalties will be recognized as royalty revenue at the later of when the related sales occur or when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).

Deferred revenue expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is classified as a current liability.

Fair value measurements – Success payments

We are required to make success payments to Harvard and Broad Institute based on increases in the per share fair market value of our common stock. Any amounts due may be settled in cash or shares of our common stock, at our discretion. The success payments are accounted for as a derivative under Accounting Standards Codification 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
 and were initially recorded at fair value with a corresponding charge to research and development expense. The liabilities are marked to market at each balance sheet date with all changes in value recognized in interest and other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations and other comprehensive loss. We will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the achievement or expiration of the success payment obligation. To determine the estimated fair value of the success payments, we used a Monte Carlo simulation model, which models the value of the liability based on several key variables, including probability of event occurrence, timing of event occurrence, as well as the price per share at the time of success payment. A significant change in our stock price or volatility could have a significant impact on the value of the liability.

Accrued and prepaid research and development costs

As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses and prepaid research and development costs. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities and vendors related to development, manufacturing and distribution of product candidate materials.

122

We base our expenses related to preclinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple vendors that conduct and manage preclinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period and adjust accordingly.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitati
ve Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $850.7 million, which consisted of cash, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes and corporate equity securities. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments are in short-term marketable securities. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, we believe an immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our investment portfolio. We have the ability to hold our investments until maturity, and therefore, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio.

We are not currently exposed to significant market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; however, we do contract with vendors that are located outside of the United States and may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates. We may enter into additional contracts with vendors located outside of the United States in the future, which may increase our foreign currency exchange risk.

Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and research, manufacturing and development costs. We believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, our operations may be adversely affected by inflation in the future.

Item 8. Financial Statement
s and Supplementary Data.

The financial statements required to be filed pursuant to this Item 8 are appended to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. An index of those financial statements is found in Item 15,
 Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules
, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accou
ntants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

None.

Item 9A. Controls 
and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated, as of December 31, 2024, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Based on that evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such date were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes policies and procedures that:

•
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;

•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and

•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We continue to review our internal control over financial reporting and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our senior management has concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. See below.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We continuously seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our internal controls. This results in refinements to processes throughout our company. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the year ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Beam Therapeutics Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Beam Therapeutics Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Beam Therapeutics Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Beam Therapeutics Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Research and Development Estimates – Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company incurred $367.6 million of research and development expenses, including accrued liabilities of $14.7 million as of December 31, 2024. As disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company expenses research and development costs, which include external costs relating to preclinical, clinical, and process development and manufacturing activities, as incurred. Research and development activities performed by service providers are accrued and expensed based upon estimates of the proportion of work completed over the term of the individual arrangements. Estimates are determined by reviewing vendor agreements and purchase orders, and through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. Amounts paid to these third parties in excess of recognized expenses are recorded as prepaid costs.

We identified auditing the estimates of the extent of work performed by research and development service providers as a critical audit matter because of the level of management judgment required and volume of such estimates made by management. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to external research and development expenses included the following, among others:

F-
2

•
We tested the design and effectiveness of controls over the estimation of accrued and prepaid research and development costs.

•
We tested the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in the estimates.

•
For a sample of service providers performing research and development activities, we performed the following:

o
Inspected the contracts and any amendments to the contracts with the service providers.

o
Evaluated the appropriateness of the method used by management to develop the estimates of the costs incurred to date.

o
Performed corroborating inquiries with the Company's research and development personnel and inspected information from the service providers, which may include the service providers’ estimate of the costs incurred to date, to evaluate the progress of the activity. 

o
Inspected the evidence of payments to the service providers related to the research activities performed.

Revenue Recognition – Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of $63.5 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, at inception, the Company determines whether contracts are within the scope of ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, or ASC 606, or other topics. For contracts that are determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services. To achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following five steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. For performance obligations where revenue is recognized over time, the Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The Company generally recognizes revenue using the cost incurred to date as compared to the total estimated cost. The impact on revenue of changes in total estimated costs are recognized on a cumulative basis in the period that the change occurs. If estimates of the total cost change, or if contract amendments change the scope of the performance obligation, the required adjustments to revenue could be material.

We identified revenue recognition as a critical audit matter because of the judgments necessary for management to estimate total costs to satisfy the applicable performance obligation under the contract. This required a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to audit management’s estimates of total costs and evaluating the results of those procedures.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to revenue included the following, among others:

•
We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over revenue recognition, including management’s controls over the estimates of total costs to satisfy the performance obligation.

•
We made a selection of revenue contracts and performed the following:

o
We obtained and read the relevant contracts and other documents related to the revenue transactions.

o
We evaluated the Company’s accounting analysis for the applicable contract, including the application to the relevant authoritative guidance.

o
We tested the amount of revenue recognized, including when applicable, the measurement of progress for revenue that is recognized over time. 

We tested management’s estimate of the total cost of fulfilling the performance obligation, including retrospective reviews of the changes in such estimates over time.

Beam Therapeutics Inc.

Notes to consolidated 
financial statements

1. 
Nature of the business and basis of presentation

Organization

Beam Therapeutics Inc., which we refer to herein as the “Company” or “Beam,” is a biotechnology company committed to establishing the leading, fully integrated platform for precision genetic medicines. Beam’s vision is to provide life-long cures to patients suffering from genetic diseases. The Company was incorporated on January 25, 2017 as a Delaware corporation and began operations in July 2017. Its principal offices are in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Liquidity and capital resources
Since its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its resources to building its base editing platform and advancing development of its portfolio of programs, establishing and protecting its intellectual property, conducting research and development activities, making arrangements to conduct manufacturing activities with contract manufacturing organizations, research and development costs including preclinical studies and IND-enabling studies, organizing and staffing the Company, maintaining its facilities and new facility build-outs, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. The Company has established internal manufacturing capabilities. The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry including, but not limited to, technical risks associated with the successful research, development and manufacturing of product candidates, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations and the ability to secure additional capital to fund operations. Current and future programs will require significant research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure. Even if the Company’s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize significant revenue from product sales.
The Company has entered into an at the market sales agreement, or the Sales Agreement, with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, pursuant to which the Company is entitled to offer and sell, from time to time at prevailing market prices, shares of its common stock having aggregate gross proceeds of up to $
1.1
 billion. The Company agreed to pay Jefferies a commission of up to 
3.0
% of the aggregate gross sale proceeds of any shares sold by Jefferies under the Sales Agreement. There were 
no
 shares sold under the Sales Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has sold 
13,769,001
 shares of its common stock under the Sales Agreement at an average price of $
62.75
 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $
864.0
 million, before deducting commissions and offering expenses payable by it.

Since its inception, the Company has incurred substantial losses and had an accumulated deficit of $
1.6
 billion as of December 31, 2024. The Company expects to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future.

The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of December 31, 2024 of $
850.7
 million will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. The Company will need additional financing to support its continuing operations and pursue its growth strategy. Until such time as the Company can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, it expects to finance its operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. The Company may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements when needed on favorable terms or at all. The inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on the Company’s financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategy. The Company will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and it may never do so.

2. S
ummary of significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB.

Principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of estimates
The 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of and during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience when available and on various factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated

F-
9

financial 
statements include, but are not limited to, incremental borrowing rate used in the calculation of lease liabilities, research and development expenses, stock-based compensation, contingent consideration liabilities, success payments and other derivative liabilities, settlement payments and certain judgments regarding revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash
Cash and cash equivalents consist of checking accounts, money market accounts, and all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase. Restricted cash represents collateral provided for letters of credit issued as security deposits in connection with the Company’s leases of its facilities.
The following table reconciles cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets to the total of the amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):

Marketable debt securities
The Company classifies marketable debt securities as available-for-sale and includes such securities within marketable securities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Available-for-sale securities consist of commercial paper, high-grade corporate notes, U.S. Treasury securities and government securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity until realized. Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and/or accreted to interest income and/or expensed over the life of the instrument. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in interest and other income (expense), net.
Corporate equity securities
The Company classifies investments in equity securities that have a readily determinable fair value as marketable securities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s marketable securities are stated at fair value. Typically, the fair value of these securities is based on a quoted price for an identical equity security. 
The Company records changes in the fair value of its equity securities in other income (expense), net in its consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss.

Concentrations of credit risk

Financial instruments that are potentially subject to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash. The Company attempts to minimize the risk related to marketable securities by working with highly rated financial institutions that invest in a broad and diverse range of financial instruments. The Company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings and maturities intended to safeguard principal balances and maintain liquidity. The Company maintains its funds in accordance with its investment policy, which defines allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and is designed to limit credit exposure to any single issuer.

Guarantees and indemnifications

As permitted under Delaware law, the Company indemnifies its officers, directors, consultants, and employees for certain events or occurrences that happen by reason of the relationship with, or position held at, the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, the Company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations, and 
no
 claims were outstanding. The Company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and, consequently, concluded that the fair value of these obligations is negligible, and no related reserves were established.
Equity issuance costs

The Company capitalizes incremental legal, professional, accounting and other third-party fees that were directly associated with its stock offerings as other non-current assets until the offerings are consummated. Upon consummation, these costs are recorded in stockholders’ equity as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital generated as a result of the offerings.

F-
10

Fair value of financial instruments

ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurement
, or

ASC 820, establishes a fair value hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. ASC 820 identifies fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a three-tiered value hierarchy that distinguishes between the following:

Level 1—Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2—Inputs other than Level 1 inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted market prices, interest rates and yield curves.

Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). Level 3 inputs include management’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk).

To the extent the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair values requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized as Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

There have been no changes to the valuation methods utilized during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
. The Company evaluates transfers between levels at the end of each reporting period.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset as follows:

Asset category

Estimated useful life

Computer equipment and software

3 years

Laboratory equipment and office furniture

5 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of useful life or remaining term

Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in interest and other income (expense). Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

F-
11

Impairment of long-lived assets
The Company evaluates its long-lived assets, which consist primarily of property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets (or asset groups) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. There were 
no
 impairment losses recognized during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
.
Freestanding financial instruments and derivatives
Pursuant to a license agreement between the President and Fellows of Harvard College, or Harvard, and the Company, or the Harvard License Agreement, and a license agreement with The Broad Institute, Inc., or Broad Institute, and the Company, or the Broad License Agreement, (see Note 9), the Company is required to make success payments to Harvard and Broad Institute based the achievement of specified multiples of the initial weighted average value of the Company’s redeemable convertible Series A-1 Preferred Stock and the Company’s redeemable convertible Series A-2 Preferred Stock, or together the Series A Preferred, at specified valuation dates, payable in cash or Company common stock. Subsequent to the IPO, the amount of the success payments is based on the market value 
of Beam’s common stock. Pursuant to a settlement agreement between a research institution and the Company, in exchange for a release of claims in its favor, the Company agreed, among other things, to pay the research institution an upfront payment and to make additional payments contingent upon the development and commercialization of BEAM-102 and BEAM-302. These contingent payments consist of certain development, regulatory, and sales-based milestone payments, as well as 
1
% royalty through 2038. Any amounts due must be settled in cash.
The success and settlement payments are accounted for as derivatives under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging. 
The liabilities are recorded at fair value at each balance sheet date with all changes in value recognized in other income (expense), in the consolidated statement of operations and other comprehensive loss. The Company will continue to adjust the liabilities for changes in fair value until the earlier of the achievement or expiration of the obligations. To determine the estimated fair value of the success payments, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation model, which models the value of the liability based on several key variables, including probability of event occurrence, timing of event occurrence, as well as the value of the Series A Preferred, prior to the IPO, and the value of the Company’s common stock, subsequent to the IPO.

Leases and rent expense
The Company accounts for leases using a right-of-use, or ROU, model, which recognizes that, at the date of commencement, a lessee has a financial obligation to make lease payments to the lessor for the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term.
At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as ROU assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying

asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company typically only includes an initial lease term in its assessment of the term of the lease arrangement. It also considers termination options and factors those into the determination of lease payments. Options to renew a lease are not included in the lease term unless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew.
Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the fixed rate at which it could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company is required to pay fees for operating expenses in addition to monthly base rent for certain operating leases (non-lease components). The Company has elected the practical expedient which allows non-lease components to be combined with lease components for all current asset classes. Variable lease payments are not included within the lease right-of-use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet, and instead are reflected as expense in the period they are incurred.

Leasehold improvements are not unique and are retained by the lessor at the end of the lease. However, in the case of a space designed to be suitable for the Company’s specific real estate needs and if the Company is responsible for cost overruns, the Company is the accounting owner of the leasehold improvements and costs associated are capitalized.

The Company’s real estate operating leases provide for scheduled annual rent increases throughout the lease terms. The Company recognizes the effects of the scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the full terms of the lease. Tenant improvement allowances, if any, provided by a landlord are recorded as a reduction of the ROU asset related to that lease at lease commencement.
Asset acquisitions
The Company measures and recognizes asset acquisitions that are not deemed to be business combinations based on the cost to acquire the assets, which includes transaction costs, and the consideration is allocated to the items acquired based on a relative fair value methodology. Goodwill is not recognized in asset acquisitions. In an asset acquisition, the cost allocated to acquire in-process research and development with no alternative future use is charged to research and development expense at the acquisition date.
At the time of acquisition, the Company determines if a transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or acquisition of assets.
Contingent consideration liabilities
The Company may be required to make milestone payments to the former stockholders and optionholders of Guide Therapeutics, Inc., or Guide, in the form of its common stock based on the achievement of certain product and technology milestones. The payments are accounted for under ASC 480, 
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
. These contingent consideration liabilities are carried at fair value which was estimated by applying a probability-based model, which utilized inputs primarily based upon the achievement and related timing of certain product and technology milestones that were unobservable in the market. The estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, initially measured and recorded on the acquisition date, are considered to be a Level 3 measurement and are reviewed quarterly, or whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate a change in fair value. The contingent consideration liabilities are recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period with changes in estimated fair values recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss.
The estimated fair value is determined based on probability adjusted discounted cash flow model that include significant estimates and assumptions pertaining to technology and product development. Significant changes in any of the probabilities of success or in the probabili
ties as to the periods in which milestones would be achieved would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The Company will continue to adjust the liabilities for changes in fair value until the earlier of the achievement or expiration of the obligations.
Revenue recognition
At inception, the Company determines whether contracts are within the scope of ASC 606 or other topics. For contracts that are determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services. To achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following five steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it determines that collection of substantially all consideration for goods and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods and services, the Company applies judgment to determine whether promised goods and services are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods and services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method, depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in management’s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Any estimates, including the effect of the constraint on variable consideration, are evaluated at each reporting period for any changes. Determining the transaction price requires significant judgment and is discussed in further detail for each of the Company’s license and collaboration agreements in Note 10.

F-
13

If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. Determining the standalone selling price requires significant judgment and is discussed in further detail for each of the Company’s license and collaboration agreements in Note 10.
The Company satisfies performance obligations either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized over time if either (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance, (ii) the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or (iii) the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. If the entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the related performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time by transferring the control of a promised good or service to a customer.
Licenses of intellectual property, or IP: If the license to the Company’s IP is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes revenues from consideration allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer can use and benefit from the licenses. For licenses that are combined with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition. The Company generally recognizes revenue using the cost incurred to date as compared to the total estimated cost. The impact on revenue of changes in total estimated costs are recognized on a cumulative basis in the period that the change occurs. If estimates of the total cost change, or if contract amendments change the scope of the performance obligation, the required adjustments to revenue could be material. Determining the revenue recognition of IP licenses requires significant judgment and is discussed in further detail for each of the Company’s license and collaboration agreements in Notes 9 and 10.
Milestone payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes development or regulatory milestone payments, the Company evaluates the probability of reaching the milestones and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur in the future, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the Company’s control or the licensee’s, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received and therefore consideration included in the transaction price is constrained. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.
Commercial Milestone Payments and Royalties: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on levels of sales, if the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, the Company has not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of its agreements.
When no remaining performance obligations are required of the Company, or following the completion of the performance obligation period, such amounts are recognized as revenue upon transfer of control of the goods or services to the customer. Generally, all amounts received or due other than sales-based milestones and royalties are classified as license and collaboration revenue. Sales-based milestones and royalties will be recognized as royalty revenue at the later of when the related sales occur or when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).

Deferred revenue expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is classified as a current liability.

F-
14

Contract balances
The Company recognizes a contract asset when the Company transfers goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, excluding any amounts presented as an account or other receivable. A contract asset is an entity’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer. The contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, primarily relate to contracts where the Company has received payment, but it has not yet satisfied or fully satisfied the related performance obligations. Upfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due and may require deferral of revenue recognition to a future period until the Company satisfies its obligations under these arrangements. Upfront payment contract liabilities resulting from the Company’s license agreements do not represent a financing component as the payment is not financing the transfer of goods or services, and the technology underlying the licenses granted reflects research and development expenses already incurred by the Company.

Research and development costs

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation, employee benefits, facilities costs, laboratory supplies, depreciation, manufacturing expenses, preclinical expenses, consulting, and other contracted services. The cost of obtaining licenses for certain technology or IP is recorded to research and development expense when incurred if the licensed technology or IP has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. 
Costs for certain research and development activities are recognized based on the terms of the individual arrangements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in the financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development costs.
Stock-based compensation
The Company’s stock-based compensation program allows for grants of stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. Grants are awarded to employees and non-employees, including directors.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, 
Compensation-Stock Compensation
, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, non-employees and directors to be recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss based on their fair values. The Company estimates the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, or Black-Scholes, for stock option grants to both employees and non-employees. The fair value of the Company’s common stock is used to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units.
Stock-based compensation awards are subject to either service- or performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards to employees, directors and non-employees with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Compensation expense related to awards to employees with performance-based vesting conditions is recognized based on grant date fair value over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the of performance condition is probable.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected stock price volatility, (ii) the expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate, and (iv) expected dividends. The Company bases its computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to the Company, including stage of product development and life science industry focus, weighted with its own volatility for the period in which its stock has been publicly traded. The historical volatility is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with expected term assumption. The Company uses the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, 
Share-Based Payment
, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees and non-employees, whereby the expected term equals the arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the options due to its lack of sufficient historical data. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity date commensurate with the expected term of the associated award. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be 
zero
 as the Company has never paid dividends and has no current plans to pay any dividends on its common stock. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.

F-

Patent costs
All patent-related costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications are expensed as incurred. Due to the uncertainty about the recovery of the expenditure, amounts incurred are classified as general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss.
Variable interest entities
The Company reviews each legal entity in which it has a financial interest to determine whether or not the entity is a variable interest entity, or VIE. If the entity is a VIE, the Company assesses whether or not it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE based on a number of factors, including (i) which party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance, (ii) the parties’ contractual rights and responsibilities pursuant to any contractual agreements and (iii) which party has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE. If the Company determines that it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it consolidates the financial statements of the VIE into its consolidated financial statements. If the Company determines that it is no longer the primary beneficiary of a consolidated VIE, or no longer has a variable interest in the VIE, the Company deconsolidates the VIE in the period that the determination is made.
Income taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company’s financial statements and tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and for loss and credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that these assets may not be realized. The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If it is not more likely than not that a position will be sustained, none of the benefit attributable to the position is recognized. The tax benefit to be recognized for any tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon resolution of the contingency. The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for income taxes.
Comprehensive loss
Comprehensive loss is defined as the change in stockholders’ equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in equity that are excluded from net loss. The Company’s only element of other comprehensive loss is unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities.
Net loss per share
The Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per share, as the Company has issued shares that meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net loss per share for each class of common and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed.
Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders is computed by adjusting net loss attributable to common stockholders to reallocate undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents.
For purposes of the dilutive net loss per share calculation, stock options and stock units for which the performance and market vesting conditions have been deemed probable, potential dilutive securities, unvested restricted stock, and common stock options are considered to be common stock equivalents, while stock options and stock units with performance- or market-based vesting conditions that were not deemed probable of meeting the applicable vesting conditions are not considered to be common stock equivalents.
Accordingly, in periods in which the Company reported a net loss, such losses were not allocated to such participating securities. In periods in which the Company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders was the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, since dilutive common shares were not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
.

Equity method of accounting
In circumstances where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of an entity in which the Company has an investment in common stock or in-substance common stock, the Company utilizes the equity method of accounting for recording related investment activity. In assessing whether the Company exercises significant influence, the Company considers the nature and magnitude of the investment, participating rights the Company holds, and relevant factors such as the presence of a collaborative or other business relationship.

Under the equity method of accounting, the Company’s investments are initially recorded at cost on the consolidated balance sheets. Upon recording an equity method investment, the Company evaluates whether there are basis differences between the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s proportionate share of the investee’s underlying net assets. Typically, the Company amortizes basis differences identified on a straight-line basis over the underlying asset’s or liability's estimated useful lives when calculating the attributable earnings or losses, excluding the basis differences attributable to in-process research and development, or IPR&D, that has no alternative future use. To the extent a basis difference relates to IPR&D and the investee is not a business as defined in ASC 805, 
Business Combinations, 
or ASC 805, the Company immediately expenses such basis difference related to IPR&D. If the Company is unable to attribute all of the basis difference to specific assets or liabilities of the investee, the residual excess of the cost of the investment over the proportional fair value of the investee’s assets and liabilities is considered to be Equity Method Goodwill and is recognized within the equity investment balance, which is tracked separately within the Company’s memo accounts. The Company subsequently records in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss its share of income or loss of the other entity within the loss from equity method investment line item. If the share of losses exceeds the carrying value of the Company’s investment, the Company will suspend recognizing additional losses and will continue to do so unless it commits to providing additional funding or commits to guarantee investee liabilities.

The Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired and considers qualitative and quantitative factors including the investee’s financial metrics, product and commercial outlook and cash usage. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period and the investment is written down to fair value.
At December 31, 2024
, the Company accounted for its investment in Orbital under the equity method of accounting. The Company has 
no
 carrying value related to this investment as of December 31, 2024 or 2023. Refer to Note 10 for further details.
Segment and geographic information
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The CODM is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The Company views its operations as and manages its business in 
one
 operating segment operating exclusively in the United States
.

Cash equivalents 
– Money market funds included within cash equivalents are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. Commercial paper and corporate notes are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through using models or other valuation methodologies.
Marketable securities
 – Marketable securities, excluding corporate equity securities, are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined using models or other valuation methodologies.

Success Payment Liability
 – As discussed further in Note 9, the Company is required to make payments to Harvard and Broad Institute based upon the achievement of specified multiples of the initial weighted average value of the Company’s Series A Preferred or, subsequent to the IPO, the market value of the Company's common stock, at specified valuation dates. The Company’s liability for the share-based success payments under the Harvard and Broad License Agreements are carried at fair value. To determine the estimated fair value of the success payment liability, the Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation methodology, which models the future movement of stock prices based on several key variables.

The computation of expected volatility was estimated using the Company's historical volatility along with available information about the historical volatility of stocks of similar publicly traded companies for a period matching the expected term assumption. In addition, the Company incorporated the estimated number, timing, and probability of valuation measurement dates in the calculation of the success payment liability.

Contingent consideration liabilities
 – Under the Guide Merger Agreement, Guide’s former stockholders and optionholders are eligible to receive up to an additional $
100.0
 million in technology milestone payments and $
220.0
 million in product milestone payments, payable in the Company’s common stock valued using the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s stock over the ten-day trading period ending two trading days prior to the date on which the applicable milestone is achieved. As these milestones are payable with a variable number of shares of the Company’s common stock, the milestone payments result in liability classification under ASC 480, 
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity
. These contingent consideration liabilities are carried at fair value which was estimated by applying a probability-based model, which utilized inputs based on timing of achievement that were unobservable in the market. These contingent consideration liabilities are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The following variables were incorporated in the calculation of the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities:

Derivative settlement liability
 – On July 19, 2024, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a research institution pursuant to which, in exchange for a release of claims in its favor, the Company agreed, among other things, to pay the research institution an upfront payment of $
15.0
 million and to make additional payments contingent upon the development and commercialization of BEAM-102 and BEAM-302. These contingent payments consist of certain development, regulatory, and sales-based milestone payments, as well as a 
1
% royalty through 2038. Any amounts due must be settled in cash. The maximum amount of development and regulatory milestone payments under the settlement agreement is $
15.0
 million, and the maximum amount of sales milestone payments is $
35
 million, per program. The Company paid the $
15.0
 million upfront payment during the 12 months ended December 31, 2024. There was no material charge related to this settlement in the year ended December 31, 2024 as the settlement value was substantially accrued in prior periods.

F-
20

The contingent settlement payments are accounted for as a derivative under Accounting Standards Codification 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging,
 as the potential payments meet the definition of a derivative and are not subject to any scope exceptions. The derivative liability is recorded at fair value on the Company's balance sheet with changes in value recognized in interest and other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations and other comprehensive loss. To determine the estimated fair value of the liability, the Company applied a probability-based model, which utilized inputs based on the potential achievement and related timing of certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones that were unobservable in the market. This derivative liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy above.

The following assumptions were incorporated in the calculation of the fair value of the derivative settlement liability:

8. Strategic restructuring
In October 2023, the Company announced updated portfolio priorities and strategic plans to restructure the Company to streamline its business operations. In connection with this portfolio prioritization and strategic restructuring, the Company reduced its employee headcount by approximately 
100
 positions, or about 
20
% of its workforce. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $
6.7
 million of 
restructuring charges
 in the consolidated statement of operations related to these actions. These charges included $
6.5
 million of one-time termination benefits and contractual termination benefits for severance, healthcare, and related benefits and $
0.2
 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The workforce reductions were substantially completed as of December 31, 2023, however the severance and other costs are paid over time.

Details of the restructuring liability activity for the Company's workforce reductions for the year ended

License

agreements
The Company has various license agreements related to technology used in its research and development activities. The license agreements may include up-front payments, option fees, ongoing maintenance fees, sublicense fees, royalty-based payments, milestone payments, success-based payments, and other payments. Option fees, when applicable, are recognized when exercised, maintenance fees, sublicense fees, and other payments are recorded as incurred based on the estimated amounts due or that will ultimately be paid. Contingent payments that are not required to be accounted for as a derivative are recognized as incurred. As the success-based payments due under the Company’s license arrangements are derivatives, the change in the fair value of the success-based payments are recognized in a separate line item in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss, as discussed further below. The total contingent obligations and non-royalty sublicense fees included in research and development expenses in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss were $
3.2
 million, $
43.5
 million, and $
2.7
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

The value attributable to sublicenses and the related sublicense fees due under the Company’s license agreements may require estimates and other judgments related to contractual requirements, which creates uncertainty over the ultimate amount that would be paid under these arrangements. Contractual amounts due are accrued and if a contingency exists related to the interpretation of the amounts due under the license agreement, the Company recognizes a liability for the amount that is probable and estimable. When no amount within the range of potential payments is a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.

Harvard license agreement

In June 2017, the Company entered into the Harvard License Agreement for certain base editing technology pursuant to which the Company received an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license under specified patent rights to develop and commercialize licensed products and a nonexclusive, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license under certain patent rights to research and develop licensed products. The Company agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products in accordance with the development plan, to introduce any licensed products that gain regulatory approval into the commercial market, to market licensed products that have gained regulatory approval following such introduction into the market, and to make licensed products that have gained regulatory approval reasonably available to the public. The license term extends until the later of the expiration of (i) the last to expire licensed patent covering a licensed product, (ii) the period of exclusivity associated with a licensed product or (iii) a certain period after the first commercial sale of a licensed product, unless terminated earlier by either party under certain provisions.
Partial consideration for the rights granted under the Harvard License Agreement include success payments, which are further described below.
Success Payments
 – Under the Harvard License Agreement, Harvard is entitled to receive success payments, in cash or shares of Company stock, determined based upon the achievement of specified multiples of the initial weighted average value of the Company’s Series A Preferred at specified valuation dates. The success payments range from $
5.0
 million to a maximum of $
105.0
 million and have valuation multiples that range from 
5
 times to 
40
 times the initial weighted average value of the Series A Preferred. Subsequent to the Company’s February 2020 IPO, the amount of success payments is based on the market value of the Company's common stock.
The Company is required to make success payments to Harvard during a period of time, or the Harvard Success Payment Period, which has been determined to be the later of (1) the ninth anniversary of the Harvard License Agreement or (2) the earlier of (a) the twelfth anniversary of the Harvard License Agreement and (b) the third anniversary of the first date on which a licensed product receives regulatory approval in the United States. During the Harvard Success Payment Period, the Company will perform a calculation of any amounts owed to Harvard on each rolling 90-day period, commencing one year after the Company’s IPO.

In May 2021, the first success payment measurement occurred and amounts due to Harvard were calculated to be $
15.0
 million. The Company elected to make the payment in shares of the Company’s common stock and issued 
174,825
 shares of the Company’s common stock to settle this liability on June 10, 2021. The Company may owe Harvard success payments of up to an additional $
90.0
 million.

Other Payments
 – 
The Company agreed to pay Harvard an annual license maintenance fee ranging from low-to-mid five figures to low six figures, depending on the calendar year. The Company is responsible for the payment of certain patent prosecution and maintenance costs incurred by Harvard related to licensed patents. To the extent achieved, the Company is obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $
75.9
 million in product development and regulatory approval milestones, or Harvard Product Milestones. If the Company completes a change of control during the term of the Harvard License Agreement, then certain of the milestone payments would be increased. To the extent there are sales of a licensed product, the Company is required to pay low single digit royalties on net sales. The Company is entitled to certain reductions and offsets on these royalties with respect to a licensed product in a given country. If the Company sublicenses its rights to develop or commercialize a licensed product under the Harvard License Agreement to a third party and the Company receives non-royalty sublicense income, then Harvard is entitled to a percentage of such consideration, ranging from the high single digits to low double digits depending on the date in which such sublicense agreement is executed and the stage of development of the Company’s licensed products at such time. 
The annual maintenance fees are recorded as an expense on an annual basis based on the stated amount for the applicable year. Annual patent costs are expensed as incurred. Upon determination that a Harvard Product Milestone is probable to occur, the amount due will be recorded as research and development expense. The Company will monitor the Harvard Product Milestone payments for this arrangement on an ongoing basis.

To the extent products are commercialized under the Harvard License Agreement, the Company will accrue royalty expense and sublicense nonroyalty payments, as applicable, for the amount it is obligated to pay, with adjustments as sales are made.

Broad license agreement

In May 2018, the Broad License Agreement was entered into with Broad Institute for certain RNA base editing technology including an RNA editor platform. Under the Broad License Agreement, Broad Institute granted exclusive and non-exclusive worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-bearing licenses under specified patent rights to develop and commercialize licensed product and a nonexclusive, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license under certain patent rights to research and develop licensed products. Under the agreement the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products in accordance with the development plan, to introduce any licensed products that gain regulatory approval into the commercial market, to market licensed products that have gained regulatory approval following such introduction into the market, and to make licensed products that have gained regulatory approval reasonably available to the public. The license term extends until the later of the expiration of (i) the last to expire licensed patent covering a licensed product, (ii) the period of regulatory exclusivity associated with a licensed product or (iii) a certain period after the first commercial sale of a licensed product unless terminated earlier by either party under certain provisions.

Editas license agreement

In May 2018, the Company entered into a license agreement, or the Editas License Agreement, with Editas Medicine, Inc., or Editas. Pursuant to the Editas License Agreement, Editas granted to the Company licenses and options to acquire licenses to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Editas, for specified uses. More specifically, Editas granted to the Company a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable, license (subject to certain exceptions and conditions) under certain intellectual property controlled by Editas for the use of base editing therapies for the treatment of any field of human diseases and conditions, subject to certain exceptions, or the Beam Field, and the licenses granted or to be granted under the Editas License Agreement, or the Editas Development and Commercialization License. Additionally, Editas granted to the Company a royalty-free, non-exclusive license under certain intellectual property owned or controlled by Editas to perform research activities in the Beam Field, or the Editas Research License. Editas provided the Company with an exclusive option to obtain an Editas Development and Commercialization License to three additional groups of intellectual property owned or controlled by Editas, on a group by group basis, during the specified option period, subject to certain exceptions. Pursuant to the Editas License Agreement, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a product that includes the rights licensed to the Company within a specified period of time and to commercialize any such products that have received regulatory approval in certain specified countries.
Additional consideration will be due to Editas if the

Company elects to exercise its option to obtain an Editas Development and Commercialization License to any of the three categories of intellectual property underlying the Editas Research License, for a fee ranging from a mid-teen million dollar amount to a low to mid-eight digit dollar amount per group, depending on the timing of the option exercise. Additionally, the Company is required to reimburse Editas for certain payments Editas may be obligated to make under existing Editas license agreements related to the intellectual property being licensed to the Company, including (i) development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and certain sublicense income payments due as a result of the Editas License Agreement and (ii) a percentage of the annual maintenance fees and patent fees due to certain of the Editas’ licensors. In addition, to the extent any products are commercialized under an Editas Development and Commercialization License, the Company would be required to make royalty payments equivalent to the royalties that would be due from Editas to any applicable licensors of Editas related to the sales of such licensed products, plus an additional tiered low- to mid-single digit royalty, depending on whether such licensed product is covered by an Editas-owned patent.
The license rights and option rights granted by Editas to the Company are subject to the terms and conditions of the underlying license agreements that Editas is a party to and under which Editas licensed rights or option rights to the Company and the termination of such in-licenses, as applicable. Unless earlier terminated by either party pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Editas License Agreement will continue in full force and effect and will expire on a licensed product-by licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) the last-to-expire royalty term under any applicable institutional license to Editas and (ii) the date at which such product is no longer covered by a valid claim of a licensed Editas-owned patent in such country. The Company has the right, at its sole discretion, at any time to terminate the Editas License Agreement in its entirety or on a group-by-group of intellectual property basis, upon ninety days written notice to Editas. Upon termination of the Editas License Agreement, all rights and licenses granted by Editas to the Company (including the rights to exercise options and obtain such licenses) will immediately terminate and patents within a group of patents will no longer be deemed licensed patents. Expiration or termination of the Editas License Agreement for any reason does not release either party of any obligation or liability which had accrued, or which is attributable to a period prior to such expiration or termination.
The option exercise fees under the agreement will be recorded as research and development expense, if and when the Company exercises such options. To date, no options have been exercised. The annual maintenance fees are recorded as an expense on an annual basis based on the stated amount for the applicable year. Annual patent costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company is required to make certain development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments to Editas upon the achievement of specified milestones. To the extent applicable, sublicense income payments will be accrued for the amount the Company is obligated to pay under each applicable in-license as amounts are due to Editas. Lastly, to the extent products are commercialized under the Editas License agreement, the Company will accrue royalty expense for the amount it is obligated to pay, with adjustments as sales are made.

10. Collaboration and license agreements
Eli Lilly and Company
In October 2023, the Company entered into a Transfer and Delegation Agreement, or the Lilly Agreement, with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, pursuant to which Lilly acquired certain assets and other rights under the Company’s amended collaboration and license agreement, or the Verve Agreement, with Verve Therapeutics, Inc., or Verve, including the Company’s opt-in rights to co-develop and co-commercialize Verve’s base editing programs for cardiovascular disease (see discussion below related to the Verve Agreement). The Company granted Lilly an exclusive sublicense to the Verve technology originally licensed to the Company under the Verve Agreement. Lilly also acquired the right to receive any future milestone or royalty payments payable by Verve under the Verve Agreement and the rights and obligations to designate representatives and participate on the joint steering committee with Verve. The Company received a $
200.0
 million nonrefundable upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $
350.0
 million in potential future development-stage payments upon the completion of certain clinical, regulatory and alliance events.
 If 
Lilly does not opt-in to co-develop and

F-
26

co-commercialize 
a licensed product, Lilly is obligated to pay the Company a percentage of any royalties received from Verve for sales of such product, subject to certain caps on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis.
For a period of 
six years
 from the effective date of the Lilly Agreement, Lilly has the right to request the Company to perform any critical research and development services, if Lilly reasonably determines that the Company is uniquely able to provide such services and other conditions are met, including that no other third parties can provide such services. The parties will negotiate an agreement governing the Company’s performance of such activity, if any, and the Company will be compensated for any services at approximately cost plus a margin. The Company has not been requested to perform any services and believes it is remote that Beam would be requested to provide any services.

In connection with the Lilly Agreement, the Company and Lilly entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement providing for the sale and issuance of 
2,004,811
 shares of the Company’s common stock to Lilly for an aggregate purchase price of $
50.0
 million.

The Company received the consideration under the Stock Purchase Agreement of $
50.0
 million in October and the upfront payment of $
200.0
 million in November 2023.

The Lilly Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement were negotiated at the same time as a package and have been accounted for as one combined contract. The Company accounts for the component of the arrangement to transfer common stock to Lilly under ASC 505, 
Equity
, and the revenue component under ASC 606, as it includes a customer-vendor relationship as defined under ASC 606 and meets the criteria to be considered a contract. The Company first applied the guidance in ASC 505 to measure the fair value of the common stock issued and allocated the remaining consideration to the ASC 606 component of the arrangement.
The overall ASC 606 transaction price as of the inception of the contract was determined to be $
216.4
 million, which is comprised of the upfront payment of $
200.0
 million and the residual value of the proceeds received in excess of the fair value of the common stock sold to Lilly of $
16.4
 million. The fair value of the common stock issued to Lilly was $
33.6
 million, as determined by management with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. There is no variable consideration included in the transaction price at inception. The Company will re-evaluate the transaction price at each reporting period.
The Company concluded that the collaboration rights and licenses to intellectual property have the same pattern and timing of transfer and are transferred as of the effective date of the Lilly Agreement. Lilly’s right to request research and development services represents an optional purchase in the agreement that does not constitute a material right. All other items promised to Lilly are immaterial in the context of the agreement.

The Company recognized revenue for the performance obligation at a point-in-time in October 2023 as all requirements related to the performance obligation have been completed. Any consideration received related to Lilly’s optional purchase of the Company’s research and development services will be accounted for as a separate contract if and when the option is exercised in accordance with ASC 606. During the year ended December 31, 2024 the Company recognized $
25.0
 million in revenue related to the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and alliance events. During the year ended 2023 the Company recognized $
216.4
 million of revenue related to the Lilly Agreement. As of 
December 31, 2024
, there was 
no
 deferred revenue related to the Lilly Agreement.

Orbital
In September 2022, the Company entered into a License and Research Collaboration Agreement, or the Orbital Agreement, with Orbital Therapeutics, Inc., or Orbital. 
Under the terms of the Orbital Agreement, the Company will collaborate with Orbital to advance nonviral delivery and 
ribonucleic acid, or 
RNA, technology by providing Orbital with certain proprietary materials, a non-exclusive research license to certain RNA technology and nonviral delivery technology controlled by the Company, and by performing research and development support services as outlined in a research plan. The Company also granted Orbital an exploitation license to certain RNA technology and nonviral delivery technology controlled by the Company. The exploitation license is exclusive in the fields of vaccines and certain protein therapeutics and nonexclusive in all other fields other than gene editing and conditioning. The collaboration is managed on an overall basis by a Joint Steering Committee, or JSC, comprised of an equal number of representatives from the Company and Orbital.
In exchange for the licenses and services provided by the Company under the Orbital Agreement, the Company received a non-exclusive research license to certain RNA technology and nonviral delivery technology controlled by Orbital, and research and development support services as outlined in a research plan. Orbital also granted the Company an exploitation license to certain RNA technology and nonviral delivery technology controlled by Orbital. The exploitation license is exclusive in the fields of gene editing and conditioning and nonexclusive in all other fields other than vaccines and certain protein therapeutics. The Company also received 
75
 million shares of Orbital’s common stock at closing.
The research plan has a term of 
three years
 and can be extended for unspecified periods upon mutual agreement between the Company and Orbital. The exploitation licenses are exclusive for an initial research term of 
three years
, 
which may be extended for up to two successive one-year periods
 by mutual agreement between the Company and Orbital. Either party may terminate the licenses granted to it under the Orbital Agreement for convenience on a product-by-product basis at any time by providing 90 days’ prior written notice.

F-
27

The Company accounts for the consideration received under the Orbital Agreement under ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, or ASC 606, as it includes a customer-vendor relationship as defined under ASC 606 and meets the criteria to be considered a contract. The overall transaction price as of the inception of the contract was determined to be $
25.5

million, which represents the fair value of the Company’s equity interest in Orbital’s common stock at inception. There is no variable consideration included in the transaction price.
The Company concluded that the research and exploitation licenses are not distinct from the other promises in the Orbital Agreement, and as such the Company determined that the licenses combined with the research and development services, know-how transfers, committee participation and materials transfer represent a performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue associated with the Orbital performance obligation over time as it is satisfied during the term of the agreement, which is 
three years
. The Company recognized $
8.5
 million of revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively, and $
2.1
 million of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of 
December 31, 2024
, there was $
6.4
 million of current deferred revenue related to the Orbital Agreement.
Beam does not have a controlling financial interest in Orbital as Beam does not have the power to direct the activities of Orbital. The Company has significant influence over Orbital through its noncontrolling representation on Orbital’s board of directors and the Company’s equity interest in Orbital. Accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the financial statements of Orbital and accounts for its investment using the equity method of accounting.
 As of the closing date in September 2022, the fair value of the Company’s investment in Orbital was $
25.5
 million. The fair value of the Orbital common stock was determined by management with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. In determining the fair value of the Company’s investment, the valuation specialist used an option pricing model backsolve approach based on Orbital's most recent funding of preferred stock. The valuation requires the input of certain subjective assumptions. The key assumptions used in the option pricing model, which are level 3 inputs, include the anticipated holding period to an exit and liquidity event, the volatility of market participants (
68
%) and the discount for lack of marketability (
43
%). At the date of the investment, a basis difference was identified as the carrying value of the Company’s investment in Orbital exceeded the Company’s proportionate share of the underlying net assets in Orbital. The Company concluded that the basis difference was primarily attributable to Orbital’s IPR&D assets. As Orbital did not meet the definition of a business due to substantially all of the estimated fair value of the gross assets being concentrated in the group of similar IPR&D assets, the basis difference attributable to the IPR&D with no alternative future use was immediately expensed as of the date of the investment. The Company’s proportionate share of the basis difference exceeded its carrying value of the equity method investment in Orbital and the equity investment balance was reduced to 
zero
. There is no commitment for the Company to provide financial support to Orbital. The Company recognized a loss of $
25.5
 million in association with the basis difference charge in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and did 
no
t recognize a gain or loss from the equity method investment for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Pfizer
In December 2021, the Company entered into a research collaboration agreement, or the Pfizer Agreement, with Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, focused on the use of certain of the Company’s base editing technology to develop 
in vivo
 therapies for rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle, and central nervous system. Under the terms of the Pfizer Agreement, the Company will conduct all research activities through development candidate selection for three base editing programs that target specific genes corresponding to specific diseases that are the subject of such programs. Pfizer will have exclusive rights to license each of the three programs at no additional cost, each an Opt-In Right, and will assume responsibility for subsequent development and commercialization. At the end of the Phase 1/2 clinical trials, the Company may elect to enter into a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Pfizer with respect to one program licensed under the collaboration for an option exercise fee equal to a percentage of the applicable development costs incurred by Pfizer, or the Participation Election. In the event the Company elects to exercise its Participation Election, upon the payment of its option exercise fee, Pfizer and the Company would share net profits as well as development and commercialization costs in a 
65
%/
35
% (Pfizer/Company) split for such program. The research collaboration is managed on an overall basis by a Joint Research Committee, or JRC, formed by an equal number of representatives from the Company and Pfizer.
At the inception of the Pfizer Agreement, the Company was entitled to receive a nonrefundable upfront payment of $
300.0
 million in consideration for the rights granted to Pfizer under the collaboration. Should Pfizer exercise its Opt-In Right for any of the three programs, the Company would be eligible to receive development, regulatory, and commercial milestones of up to $
350.0
 million per program, for potential total consideration of up to $
1.35
 billion, plus royalty payments on global net sales for each licensed program, if any. If Pfizer does not exercise its Opt-In Right for a program, the Company’s rights in such program revert to the Company and the Company will be required to pay Pfizer earn-out payments equal to a low single digit percentage of net sales earned on such program for a 
ten-year
 period, if any. As the $
300.0
 million upfront fee was not received by the Company as of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a collaboration receivable

for $
300.0
 million with a corresponding deferred revenue liability. The Company received the $
300.0
 million upfront payment in January 2022.

During the collaboration term, Pfizer has a one-time option to substitute a disease that is the subject of a specific program with one pre-defined substitute disease. The collaboration has an initial term of 
four years
 and may be 
extended for an additional year on a program-by-program basis
. Pfizer may terminate the Pfizer Agreement for convenience on any or all of the programs by providing 90 days’ prior written notice.

F-
28

The Company accounts for the Pfizer Agreement under ASC 606, as it includes a customer-vendor relationship as defined under ASC 606 and meets the criteria to be considered a contract.

The overall transaction price as of the inception of the contract was determined to be $
300.0
 million, which is comprised entirely of the nonrefundable upfront payment. There is no variable consideration included in the transaction price at inception as the future milestone payments are fully constrained and the Company is not required to estimate variable consideration for the royalty payments at contract inception. The Company will re-evaluate the transaction price in each reporting period.
The Company has concluded that the licenses to its base editing technology, including the exclusive development and commercialization rights, are not capable of being distinct from the other performance obligations, and as such the Company has determined that the licenses combined with the other research and development services represent performance obligations and no up-front revenue was recognized for the licenses.

The selling price of each performance obligation was determined based on the Company’s estimated standalone selling price, or the ESSP. The Company developed the ESSP for all of the performance obligations included in the Pfizer Agreement by determining the total estimated costs to fulfill each performance obligation identified with the objective of determining the price at which it would sell such an item if it were to be sold regularly on a standalone basis. The Company allocated the stand-alone selling price to the performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling price method.
The Company recognizes revenue for each performance obligation as it is satisfied during the term of the agreement using an input method. The Company allocated the transaction price of $
300.0
 million to each of the three performance obligations, which includes each of the three base editing programs combined with the research and development services, licenses, and exclusive development and commercialization rights. Revenue is recognized using an input method based on the actual costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs tow
ards satisfying the performance obligation as this method provides the most faithful depiction of the entity’s performance in transferring control of the goods and services promised to Pfizer and represents the Company’s best estimate of the period of the obligation. The impact on revenue of changes in total estimated costs are recognized on a cumulative basis in the period that the change occurs. If estimates of the total cost change, or if contract amendments change the scope of the performance obligation, the required adjustments to revenue could be material. The Company recognized $
8.4
 million, $
134.3
 million and $
48.2
 million of revenue under the Pfizer Agreement, during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, there was $
88.5
 million and $
20.6
 million of current and long-term deferred revenue, respectively, related to the Pfizer Agreement.

Sana Biotechnology
In October 2021, the Company entered into an option and license agreement, or the Sana Agreement, with Sana Biotechnology, Inc., or Sana, under which the Company granted Sana a license for non-exclusive rights to its CRISPR Cas12b nuclease system for the development and commercialization of certain engineered cellular therapy programs. In addition to the license, the Company performed an initial technology transfer following the effective date of the Sana Agreement providing Sana with certain know-how, as required under the Sana Agreement. This technology transfer occurred in 2021. Following the license transfer and completion of the initial technology transfer, Sana is responsible, at its sole expense, for the development and commercialization of therapeutic products which must contain either specified CAR antigen targets or pluripotent stem cell, or PSC, product types.
As consideration for the license, the Company received an upfront payment of $
50.0
 million from Sana in October 2021. In addition, the Company may be eligible to receive development, regulatory, and commercial milestones of up to $
65.0
 million from Sana on any product candidate or product. The Company will also be entitled to receive royalties equal to a low single digit percentage of net sales on any product.
For up to forty-two months following the effective date of the Sana Agreement, Sana has the option to select up to a cumulative total of two additional CAR antigen targets or PSC product types for an additional fee of $
15.0
 million per additional CAR antigen target and additional PSC product type, or the Option Rights, for an aggregate potential additional consideration of $
30.0
 million. Further, for up to thirty months following the effective date of the Sana Agreement, Sana has a one-time right to substitute, in the aggregate, either one CAR antigen target or one PSC product type at no additional cost, or the Replacement Right. Sana may also select a specified number of additional or replacement genetic targets for each PSC product type at any time prior to the third anniversary of the effective date at no additional cost, or the Genetic Target Nomination Rights. Sana may terminate the Sana Agreement for convenience prior to the first commercial sale of any licensed product by providing 90 days’ prior written notice or upon 180 days’ prior written notice after first commercial sale.
The Company accounts for the Sana Agreement under ASC 606 as it includes a customer-vendor relationship as defined under ASC 606 and meets the criteria to be considered a contract. The overall transaction price as of the inception of the contract was determined to be $
50.0
 million, which is composed entirely of the nonrefundable upfront payment. There is no variable consideration included in the transaction price at inception as the future milestone payments are fully constrained and the Company is not required to estimate variable consideration for the royalty payments at contract inception. The Company will re-evaluate the transaction price in each reporting period.

F-
29

The Company has identified a single performance obligation, which includes (i) the non-exclusive license granted to Sana under the Company’s patent rights and know-how and (ii) the initial technology transfer following the effective date, which occurred in 2021. The Company further concluded that the Option Rights, Replacement Right, and Genetic Target Nomination Rights did not grant Sana a material right. As the Company only identified one performance obligation, no allocation of the transaction price is required.

The Company recognized $
2.0
 million of revenue under the Sana Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2024 and $
1.8
 million of revenue under the Sana Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company did 
no
t recognize any 
revenue under the Sana Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Apellis Pharmaceuticals
In June 2021, the Company entered into a research collaboration agreement, or the Apellis Agreement, with Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Apellis, focused on the use of certain of the Company’s base editing technology to discover new treatments for complement system-driven diseases. Under the terms of the Apellis Agreement, the Company will conduct preclinical research on up to six base editing programs that target specific genes within the complement system in various organs, including the eye, liver, and brain. Apellis has an exclusive option to license any or all of the six programs, or in each case, an Opt-In Right, and will assume responsibility for subsequent development. The Company may elect to enter into a 50-50 U.S. co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Apellis with respect to one program instead of a license. The collaboration is managed on an overall basis by an alliance steering committee formed by an equal number of representatives from the Company and Apellis.
As part of the collaboration, the Company is eligible to receive a total of $
75.0
 million in upfront and near-term milestones from Apellis, which is comprised of $
50.0
 million received upon signing and an additional $
25.0
 million payment on June 30, 2022, the one-year anniversary of the effective date of the Apellis Agreement, or the First Anniversary Payment. Following any exercise of an Opt-In Right for any of the six programs, the Company will be eligible to receive development, regulatory, and sales milestones from Apellis, as well as royalty payments on sales. The collaboration has an initial term of 
five years
 and may be extended up to 
two years
 on a per year and program-by-program basis. During the collaboration term, Apellis may, subject to certain limitations, substitute a specific complement gene and/or organ for any of the initial base editing programs. Apellis may terminate the Apellis Agreement for convenience on any or all of the programs by providing prior written notice. The Company received the $
50.0
 million upfront payment from Apellis in July 2021 and the $
25.0
 million First Anniversary Payment in June 2022.

The Company accounts for the Apellis Agreement under ASC 606 as it includes a customer-vendor relationship as defined under ASC 606 and meets the criteria to be considered a contract.

The overall transaction price as of the inception of the contract was determined to be $
75.0
 million, which is composed of the upfront payment of $
50.0
 million and the First Anniversary Payment of $
25.0
 million. The Company will re-evaluate the transaction price in each reporting period.
The Company concluded that each of the six base editing programs combined with the research and development service, licenses, substitution rights and governance participation were material promises that were both capable of being distinct and were distinct within the context of the Apellis Agreement and represented separate performance obligations. Therefore, the Company did 
no
t recognize any upfront revenue related to the license. The Company further concluded that the Opt-In Rights and option to extend the collaboration term did not grant Apellis a material right. The Company determined that the term of the contract is 
five years
, as this is the period during which both parties have enforceable rights.
The selling price of each performance obligation was determined based on the Company’s estimated standalone selling price, or the ESSP. The Company developed the ESSP for all of the performance obligations included in the Apellis Agreement by determining the total estimated costs to fulfill each performance obligation identified with the objective of determining the price at which it would sell such an item if it were to be sold regularly on a standalone basis. The Company allocated the stand-alone selling price to the performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling price method.
The Company recognizes revenue for each performance obligation as it is satisfied over the 
five-year
 term using an input method. The Company allocated the transaction price of $
75.0
 million to each of the six performance obligations, which includes each of the six base editing programs combined with the research and development service, licenses, substitution rights and governance participation, and 
is being recognized using an input method based on the actual costs incurred as a percentage of total budgeted costs towards satisfying the performance obligation as this method provides the most faithful depiction of the entity’s performance in transferring control of the goods and services promised to Apellis and represents the Company’s best estimate of the period of the obligation. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company 
recognized $
19.7
 million, $
16.4
 million and $
10.6
 million of revenue, respectively, related to the Apellis Agreement. As of 
December 31, 2024, there is $
14.0
 million and $
12.6
 million of current and long-term deferred revenue, respectively, related to the Apellis Agreement.

Verve
In April 2019, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Verve, or the Verve Agreement, to investigate gene editing strategies to modify genes associated with an increased risk of coronary diseases and in July 2022, the Company and Verve amended the Verve Agreement. Under the terms of the Verve Agreement, as amended, the Company granted Verve an exclusive license to certain base editor technology and improvements and Verve granted the Company a non-exclusive license under certain know-how and patents controlled by Verve, an interest in joint collaboration technology and a non-exclusive license under certain delivery technology. 
In connection with the Verve Agreement, Verve issued the Company 
2.6
 million shares of its common stock as partial consideration for the licenses granted, having a fair value of $
0.5
 million. The fair value of the Verve common stock was determined by management with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. In addition, to the extent certain clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones were met with respect to licensed products, Verve was required to pay to the Company certain amounts, as defined in the agreement. Lastly, to the extent there were sales of a licensed product, Verve was obligated to pay the Company royalties, as defined in the agreement.
The Company also purchased shares of Verve's Series A preferred stock during the year ended December 31, 2020. During June 2021, Verve completed an initial public offering of its common stock. In connection with Verve’s initial public offering, Verve effected a 
one-for-
9.2592
 reverse stock split and also converted all shares of its preferred stock into shares of common stock. As of 
December 31, 2024, the Company owned 
546,970
 shares of Verve's common stock valued at $
3.1
 million.
Management determined that the performance obligations associated with the Verve Agreement were the combined licenses and improvements related to the licensed technology. All other items promised to Verve were immaterial in the context of the agreement. The fair value of the shares issued by Verve to the Company were considered a fixed upfront payment of $
0.5
 million in the form of non-cash consideration.

In October 2023, the Company, Verve, and Lilly entered into a Side Letter Agreement whereby the Company agreed to delegate to Lilly certain rights and obligations existing under the Verve Agreement, including the Company’s rights and obligations to co-develop and co-commercialize opt-in products, the financial rights to milestone and royalty payments, and the right to participate on certain joint decision-making committees. The Company determined that the transfer and delegation of rights represents a modification of the Verve Agreement to be accounted for as if it were part of the existing contract in accordance with ASC 606. Prior to the modification, the Company determined that its performance obligations associated with the Verve Agreement at contract inception and subsequent modifications were not distinct and represented a single performance obligation, and that the obligation would be completed over the performance period of the agreement. Accordingly, the upfront payment was being recognized as revenue using a time-based proportional performance model over the contract term (April 2019 through 2038) of the collaboration, as license revenue. The milestone payments and royalties were considered variable consideration and were constrained up until the modification date as no milestones or royalties were achieved. Subsequent to the modification, management concluded that the Company does not have material ongoing obligations to Verve in the arrangement and that the remaining revenue under the agreement should be recognized at a point-in-time upon modification. Therefore, the Company recognized the remaining $
0.3
 of unrecognized revenue in October 2023.
The Company did 
no
t recognize any revenue under the Verve Agreement during the year ended 
December 31, 2024
 and has 
no
 remaining deferred revenue related to the Verve Agreement as of 
December 31, 2024. For each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022
, the Company recognized approximately $
0.4
 million and less than $
0.1
 million of license revenue, respectively.

11. Common stock

The Company has entered into the Sales Agreement with Jefferies pursuant to which the Company is entitled to offer and sell, from time to time at prevailing market prices, shares of its common stock having aggregate gross proceeds of up to $
1.1
 billion. The Company agreed to pay Jefferies a commission of up to 
3.0
% of the aggregate gross sale proceeds of any shares sold by Jefferies under the Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has sold 
13,769,001

12. Stock option and grant plan

2017 stock option and grant plan

In June 2017, the Company’s board of directors adopted the Beam Therapeutics Inc. 2017 Stock Option and Grant Plan, or the 2017 Plan, which provided for the grant of qualified incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock or other awards to the Company’s employees, officers, directors, advisors, and outside consultants for the issuance or purchase of shares of the Company’s common stock.
The 2017 Plan is administered by the board of directors. Stock options awarded under the 2017 Plan expire 
10 years
 after the grant date. Certain options provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control, as defined in the 2017 Plan.

2019 incentive plan
In October 2019, the Company’s board of directors adopted the Beam Therapeutics Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2019 Plan, and, following the IPO, all equity-based awards are granted under the 2019 Plan. The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of qualified and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock and stock units, performance awards, and other share-based awards to the Company’s employees, officers, directors, advisors, and outside consultants.
The maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be issued under the 2019 Plan was initially 
3,700,000
 shares, or the Share Pool, plus the number of shares of the Company’s common stock underlying awards under the 2017 Plan, not to exceed 
5,639,818
 shares, that become available again for grant under the 2017 Plan in accordance with its terms. The Share Pool will automatically increase on January 1st of each year from 2021 to 2029 by the lesser of (i) 
four
 percent of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding as of the close of business on the immediately preceding December 31st and (ii) the number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors on or prior to such date for such year.
As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
13,773,507
 shares reserved and 
1,591,110
 shares available for future issuance under the 2019 Plan.

The Company has granted stock options to certain employees to purchase shares of common stock that contain certain performance-based vesting criteria, primarily related to the achievement of certain development milestones related to editing applications, and the closing price of the Company’s common stock following an IPO. Recognition of stock-based compensation expense associated with these performance-based stock options commences when the performance condition is considered probable of achievement, using management’s best estimates, which consider the inherent risk and uncertainty regarding the future outcomes of the milestones. The expense related to performance-based options was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was $
17.13
, $
27.88
 and $

As of December 31, 2024, there was 
$
86.8
 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately

2.4

years.
Restricted stock

The Company issued shares of restricted common stock during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, which consisted only of restricted stock units. 
Restricted common stock issued generally vests over a period of 
two 
to 
four years
.

Generally, if the holders of restricted stock units cease to have a business relationship with the Company, any unvested restricted stock units will be cancelled.

2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In February 2020, the Company’s board of directors adopted the Beam Therapeutics Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, which was approved by the Company’s stockholders. Pursuant to the ESPP, certain employees of the Company, excluding consultants and non-employee directors, are eligible to purchase common stock of the Company at a reduced rate during offering periods. The ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock using funds contributed through payroll deductions, subject to a calendar year limit of $
25,000
 and at a purchase price of 
85
% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or on the applicable purchase date, which will be the final trading day of the applicable purchase period.

The Company used the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of the purchase right under the ESPP on the date of grant. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock for a period of years corresponding with the expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for securities with a maturity period similar to the expected life of the option. The expected life is based on the term of the purchase period for the grants made under the ESPP.
The Company uses the straight-line attribution approach to record the expense over the offering period. Stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP for the years ended December 31, 2024
, 2023 and 2022 was $
1.3
 million, $
1.3
 million and $
1.5
 million, respectively.

The Company issued 
135,187
, 
130,403
 and 
70,073
 shares under the ESPP during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively. As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
2,928,706
 shares available for issuance under the ESPP.

13. Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders

As noted above, for periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to common stockholders, potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as their effects would be anti-dilutive. Therefore, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same. 
The Company excluded the following potential common shares, presented based on amounts outstanding at period end, from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded a current tax provision of less than $
0.1
 million, $
1.4
 million and 
$
3.4
 million 
of income tax expense, respectively, which reflects that Company generated taxable income that was not fully offset by the use of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. Management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets and has determined that it is not more likely than not that the Company will recognize the benefits of the deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The valuation allowance increased by $
108.9
 million in 2024 due to the increase in deferred tax assets, primarily due to increased capitalization of research and development expenditures in 2024. The valuation allowance increased by $
75.0
 million in 2023.
Additionally, Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, limit a corporation’s ability to utilize tax attributes to the extent the corporation experiences an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change in ownership, measured by value, among 5% or greater shareholders over a rolling three-year testing period. To the extent a corporation experiences an ownership change, utilization of pre-ownership change tax attributes (e.g., net operating losses and general business tax credits) to offset post-ownership change taxable income or taxes, is subject to an annual limitation, generally calculated as the pre-ownership change equity value of the corporation, subject to certain prescribed adjustments, multiplied by the long-term tax exempt rate published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company completed a Section 382 study as of December 31, 2024, and determined that no historical ownership changes occurred since December 2021. The Company may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in stock ownership.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
181.5
 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards compared to $
16.6
 million as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
61.7
 million of federal and $
32.7
 million of Massachusetts tax credits that expire starting in 
2043
 and 
2038
, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $
41.3
 million of federal and $
19.5
 million of Massachusetts tax credits that expire starting in 
2042
 and 
2037
.
As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company had 
no
 uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes both interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company has 
no
t recorded any interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits since its inception.
The Company filed income tax returns in the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in all tax years since inception. Tax years beginning in 2021 remain open to examination in these jurisdictions, as carryforward attributes generated in past years may be adjusted in a future period. The IRS has not made any assessments as of December 31, 2024.

15. Related party transactions

Orbital
As described in Note 10, the Company has significant influence over, but does not control, Orbital through its noncontrolling representation on Orbital's board of directors and the Company’s equity interest in Orbital. The Company and Orbital are also parties to a collaboration and license agreement and have multiple common board members.
Founders
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, the Company made payments of $
0.3
 million, $
0.4
 million and $
0.4
 million, respectively, to its 
three
 founder shareholders for scientific consulting and other expenses.

16. Employee benefits

In 2018, the Company established a defined-contribution plan under Section 
401(k)
 of the Internal Revenue Code, or the 401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan covers all employees who meet defined minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. Beginning January 1, 2020, the Company made matching contributions equal to 
50
% of the employee’s contributions, subject to a maximum of 
6
% of eligible compensation. The Company made matching contributions of $
2.3
 million, $
2.5
 million, and $
2.0
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
 respectively.

17. Segment Data
The Company defines its segments on the basis of the way in which internally reported financial information is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, to analyze financial performance, make decisions, and allocate resources. The Company’s 
CODM is John Evans, its Chief Executive Officer
. The Company manages its operations as a 
single
 operating and reportable segment and the measure of segment profit or loss is consolidated net income (loss). 
The CODM uses net income (loss) in the budget and forecasting process and considers budget-to-actual variances on a quarterly basis when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources.
The internal reporting of significant segment expenses is based on the functional classification. External expenses include costs from external manufacturing, clinical and research organizations, supply chain and logistics costs, consultants, and other vendors. Employee related expenses include, employee salaries and benefits costs, employee meal, travel and entertainment spend, along with payroll related taxes and other similar items. These functional costs exclude stock-based compensation, facility and information technology costs, depreciation and amortization, and other segment items.
