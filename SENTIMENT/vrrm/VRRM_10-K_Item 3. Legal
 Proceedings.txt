Item 3. Legal
 Proceedings

We are subject to legal and regulatory actions that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, and may be subject to similar or other claims in the future. Legal disputes and other claims and proceedings may relate to, among other things, intellectual property, commercial arrangements, negligence and fiduciary duty claims, vicarious liability based on conduct of individuals or entities outside of our control, including our third-party service providers, antitrust claims, deceptive trade practices, general fraud claims and employment law claims, including compliance with wage and hour regulations. In addition to more general litigation, at times we have also been a named party in claims made against our customers, including putative class actions challenging the legality and constitutionality of automated photo enforcement and other similar programs of our Government Solutions customers, and consumer fraud claims brought against us and our Commercial Services customers alleging faulty disclosures regarding our services. From time to time, we may also be reviewed or investigated by U.S. federal, state or local regulators or regulators in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate regarding these and other matters, including proper licensing and tax assessments. All litigation is inherently unpredictable and we could incur judgments or enter into settlements or claims in the future that could materially impact our results.

Brantley v. City of Gretna
 is a class action lawsuit filed in the 24th Judicial District Court of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana against the City of Gretna (the “
City
”) and its safety camera vendor, Redflex Traffic Systems, Inc. in April 2016. The Company acquired Redflex Traffic Systems, Inc. as part of its June 2021 purchase of Redflex Holdings Limited. The plaintiff class, which was certified on March 30, 2021, alleges that the City’s safety camera program was implemented and operated in violation of local ordinances and the state constitution, including that the City’s hearing process violated the plaintiffs’ due process rights for lack of a “neutral” arbiter of liability for traffic infractions. Plaintiffs seek recovery of traffic infraction fines paid. The City and Redflex Traffic Systems, Inc. appealed the trial court’s ruling granting class certification, which was denied and their petition for discretionary review of the certification ruling by the Louisiana Supreme Court was declined. Discovery has concluded and trial is scheduled for March 2025. Based on the information available to the Company at present, it has accrued an estimated amount within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. The information contained in Note 16, 
Commitments and Contingencies
, included in Item 8 of this 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.

Holders of Record

As of February 21, 2025, we had 7 holders of record of our Class A Common Stock. Because many of our shares of Class A Common Stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.

Warrants

All warrants that were outstanding to acquire shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, including warrants originally issued to Gores Sponsor II, LLC in a private placement (the “

In addition, we redeemed 634 Public Warrants at a price of $0.01 per warrant pursuant to the terms of the warrant agreement governing the Public Warrants.

Dividends

We have not paid any cash dividends on our Class A Common Stock to date. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition. The payment of any cash dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors. In addition, our Board of Directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future. Further, our ability to declare dividends is limited by restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness.

(2) In October 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to an aggregate amount of $100.0 million of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock over an 18-month period in open market, ASR or privately negotiated transactions. On December 4, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $100 million of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock under the existing October 2023 program, providing us with approximately $112.7 million available for repurchases. As of December 31, 2024, less than $0.1 million remained available under the share repurchase authorization.

Earn-Out Agreement

Under the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “
Merger Agreement
”), pursuant to which we became the owner, directly or indirectly, of all of the equity interests of Verra Mobility Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries, PE Greenlight Holdings, LLC was entitled to receive additional shares of Class A Common Stock (the “
Earn-Out Shares
”
) if the volume weighted average closing sale price of one share of Class A Common Stock on the Nasdaq exceeded certain defined thresholds for a period of at least 10 days out of 20 consecutive trading days at any time during a five-year period. There were four tranches of contingent shares under the agreement, with each tranche resulting in an issuance of 2,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (not to exceed a total of 10,000,000 shares). On April 26, 2019 and January 27, 2020, the criteria for the issuance of the first and second tranches was met and as a result, an aggregate 5,000,000 Earn-out Shares were issued.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that are included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report. This Item generally discusses fiscal years 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2023 and 2022 are not included, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which specific discussions and comparisons are incorporated herein by reference.

Overview

We are a leading provider of smart mobility technology solutions, principally operating throughout the United States, Australia, Europe and Canada. We make transportation safer, smarter and more connected through our integrated, data-driven solutions, including toll and violations management, title and registration services, automated safety and traffic enforcement and commercial parking management. We bring together vehicles, hardware, software, data and people to solve transportation challenges for customers around the world, including commercial fleet owners such as RACs, Direct Fleets and FMCs, as well as governments, universities, parking operators, healthcare facilities, transportation hubs and violation-issuing authorities. Our vision is to continue to develop and use technology and data intelligence to make transportation safer, smarter and more connected globally.

Our Segments

We have three operating and reportable segments, Commercial Services, Government Solutions and Parking Solutions:

•
Our Commercial Services segment offers toll and violation management solutions and title and registration services for commercial fleet customers, including RACs and FMCs in North America. In Europe, we provide tolling and violations processing services.  

•
Our Government Solutions segment offers photo enforcement solutions and services to its customers. We provide complete, end-to-end speed, red-light, school bus stop arm and bus lane enforcement solutions. Our international operations primarily involve the sale of traffic enforcement products and recurring maintenance services related to the equipment and software.  

•
Our Parking Solutions segment provides an integrated suite of parking software, transaction processing and hardware solutions to universities, municipalities, commercial parking operators and health care facilities in the United States and Canada.  

Segment performance is based on revenues and income from operations before depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation. The measure also excludes interest expense, net, income taxes and certain other transactions and is inclusive of other income, net.

Executive Summary

We operate under long-term contracts and a highly reoccurring service revenue model. We continue to execute our strategy to grow revenue organically year over year and focus on initiatives that support our long-term strategy. During the periods presented, we:

•
Increased total revenue by $61.9 million, or 7.6%, from $817.3 million in fiscal year 2023 to $879.2 million in fiscal year 2024. The increase was mainly due to service revenue resulting from increased travel volume and FMCs penetration in the Commercial Services segment and the growth from speed, maintenance and bus lane programs in the Government Solutions segment.

•
Generated cash flows from operating activities of $223.6 million and $206.1 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our cash on hand was $77.6 million as of December 31, 2024. 

•
Used existing cash on hand of $200.0 million during fiscal year 2024 to repurchase approximately 7.9 million shares authorized under a 2023 share repurchase program.

41

•
Continued to focus on debt management and lowering our exposure to higher interest rates, and as a result, we refinanced our debt during fiscal year 2024 which reduced our interest rate by an aggregate 111.4 basis points. In addition, we made early repayments of approximately $9.0 million and $172.5 million on our 2021 Term Loan (defined below) during fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Recent Events

Share Repurchases and Retirement

In October 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to an aggregate amount of $100.0 million of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock over an 18-month period in open market, ASR or privately negotiated transactions. In June 2024, we entered into a share repurchase agreement with a stockholder, pursuant to which we repurchased, directly from the stockholder, 2.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $51.5 million. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares through open market transactions and paid $35.8 million. In December 2024, our Board of Directors increased the authorization to repurchase up to an additional $100 million of our shares under the existing October 2023 program, providing us with approximately $112.7 million available for repurchases.

On December 11, 2024, we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution and paid $112.7 million to receive an initial delivery of 3,821,958 shares of our Class A Common Stock. The final settlement is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2025, at which time, we expect to receive additional shares calculated using a volume-weighted average price over the term of the ASR agreement.

We paid a total of $200.0 million for share repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2024. All repurchased shares were subsequently retired. Refer to Note 12, 
Stockholders' Equity
, in Item 8, 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, 
for additional information on our share repurchases.

Cancellation of the Interest Rate Swap

We exercised our option to cancel the interest rate swap agreement, effective the end of the third quarter of 2024, which was previously used to hedge our exposure to higher interest rates associated with the variable portion of the interest rate on our 2021 Term Loan. Refer to Note 2, 
Significant Accounting Policies
, in Item 8, 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
, for additional information.

NYCDOT Contract

NYCDOT represented approximately 15.8% and 16.9% of our total revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 17.2% and 18.3% of total accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our contract with NYCDOT expired on December 31, 2024, and we are presently participating in a competitive procurement for a new NYCDOT automated enforcement program contract. We have executed a one-year contract extension with NYCDOT that expires December 31, 2025. The extension allows NYCDOT to continue to utilize our automated enforcement program under the same terms until the competitive procurement process is completed. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in winning the competitive procurement for the new automated enforcement contract, or that if we are successful, the terms of the contract will be similar to our current contract. If we are unable to win the competitive procurement for a new contact with NYCDOT, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

42

Goodwill Impairment

We recorded a $97.1 million impairment to goodwill in our Parking Solutions segment during fiscal year 2024, which is presented in a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations. This was in connection with our 2024 assessment of goodwill impairment where the Parking Solutions reporting unit's carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. Refer to Note 2, 
Significant Accounting Policies
, in Item 8, 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
, for additional information.

Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations

We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Risk Factors.”

Macroeconomic Conditions

Our business is susceptible to a number of industry-specific and global macroeconomic factors that may cause our actual results of operations to differ from our historical results of operations or current expectations. The factors and trends that we currently believe are or will be most impactful to our results of operations and financial condition include the following: the inflationary impact on items such as wages and travel-related costs, future travel demand, and legislation regarding the adoption, expansion or prohibition of automated enforcement and traffic safety technology by local or state governments. We continue to monitor the potential favorable or unfavorable impacts of these and other factors on our business, operations, financial condition, and future results of operations.

Travel Demand

Our Commercial Services segment is largely impacted by its customer demand which in turn is impacted by a variety of factors including seasonality, demand for business and leisure travel, reductions in the level of air travel, higher airfare costs, increases in energy prices, general international, national and local economic conditions and cycles, as well as other factors affecting travel levels, such as military conflicts, terrorist incidents, natural disasters and epidemic diseases.

We monitor the Transportation and Security Administration passenger volume (“
TSA Passenger Volume
”) as one of several measures for Commercial Services revenue growth. TSA Passenger Volume measures the number of passengers screened by the TSA at United States airports, which correlates to the number of vehicles rented by travelers and toll road usage. In fiscal year 2024, TSA Passenger Volume increased approximately five percent over fiscal year 2023, one of several factors contributing to Commercial Services revenue growth.

Electronic Tolling Penetration

Our Commercial Services segment is impacted by the number of toll roads in the United States and the geographic concentration of such roads.

We monitor the expansion and penetration of toll roadways across the United States and the percentage of toll roads that rely on cashless or all-electronic infrastructure. In fiscal year 2024, approximately 70% of all toll roadways in the United States relied on cashless or electronic payment methods.

Enabling Legislation

Our Government Solutions segment is impacted, in significant part, by enabling legislation that permits photo enforcement programs at the state and local level in the United States. Accordingly, we depend on national, state and local governments authorizing the use of automated photo enforcement and not otherwise materially restricting its use.

43

Primary Components of Our Operating Results

Revenues

Service Revenue.
 Our Commercial Services segment generates service revenue primarily through the operation and management of tolling programs and processing violations for RACs, FMCs and other large fleet customers. These solutions are full-service offerings by which we enroll the license plates of our customers’ vehicles and transponders with tolling authority accounts, pay tolls and violations on the customers’ behalf and, through proprietary technology, integrate with customer data to match the toll or violation to the driver and then bill the driver (or our customer, as applicable) for use of the service. The cost of certain tolls, violations and our customers’ share of administration fees are netted against revenue. We also generate service revenue in our Commercial Services segment through processing titles and registrations.

Our Government Solutions segment generates service revenue through the operation and maintenance of photo enforcement systems. Revenue drivers in this segment include the number of systems installed and the monthly revenue per system. Ancillary service revenue is generated in our Government Solutions segment from payment processing, pass-through fees for collection expense, and other fees.

Our Parking Solutions segment generates service revenue mainly from offering software as a service ("
SaaS
"), subscription fees, professional services and citation processing services related to parking management solutions to its customers.

Product Sales.
  Product sales are generated by the sale of photo enforcement equipment in the Government Solutions segment and specialized hardware in the Parking Solutions segment. Customer buying patterns vary greatly from period to period related to product sales.

Commercial Services service revenue includes mainly toll and violation management revenues from RACs and FMCs. Commercial Services service revenue increased by $34.9 million, or 9.4%, from $372.8 million in fiscal year 2023 to $407.7 million in fiscal year 2024. This increase was primarily due to increased travel volume, product adoption and increased tolling activity compared to the prior year. These factors contributed to a $18.1 million growth in RAC tolling revenue. An increase in enrolled vehicles as well as higher tolling activity from our FMC customers contributed to a $8.4 million growth in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The remaining revenue growth was mainly generated from processing titles and registrations as well as processing violations compared to the prior year.

Government Solutions service revenue includes revenue from speed, red-light, school bus stop arm and bus lane photo enforcement systems. Service revenue increased by $23.9 million to $367.9 million in fiscal year 2024 compared to $344.0 million in fiscal year 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the expansion of speed, maintenance and bus lane programs contributing approximately $17.1 million to the increase in service revenue this year. The remaining increase was mainly attributable to expansions across school bus stop arm programs.

Parking Solutions service revenue decreased by $0.7 million to $66.1 million in fiscal year 2024 compared to $66.8 million in fiscal year 2023. The increased revenue from SaaS product offerings was offset by a decrease in professional services related to parking management solutions.

Product Sales.
  Product sales increased $3.8 million year-over-year and were $37.5 million and $33.7 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to a $8.6 million increase in product sales to Government Solutions customers, offset by a $4.8 million decrease in the Parking Solutions segment driven by a structural transition from hardware to software and mobile payment solutions. Customer buying patterns vary greatly from period to period related to product sales.

Cost of Service Revenue, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization.  
Cost of service revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization increased from $18.2 million for fiscal year 2023 to $19.0 million for fiscal year 2024, mainly due to increased recurring service costs for the Parking Solutions segment.

Cost of Product Sales.  
Cost of product sales increased by approximately $1.8 million from $25.2 million in fiscal year 2023 to $27.1 million in fiscal year 2024, which was in line with the increase in product sales discussed above.

Operating Expenses.  
Operating expenses increased by $22.6 million, or 8.3%, from $273.3 million for fiscal year 2023 to $295.9 million in fiscal year 2024. The increase in 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase of $19.7 million in wages expense, of which, $15.7 million was in the Government Solutions segment and $3.7 million in the Commercial Services segment. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased from 33.4% to 33.7% in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively. The following table presents operating expenses by segment:

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
.  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $3.5 million to approximately $195.1 million for fiscal year 2024 compared to $198.6 million for fiscal year 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a $23.3 million decrease in legal expenses compared to the prior year, partially offset by $9.0 million in higher wages and benefits expense, of which, $3.2 million was in the Government Solutions segment and $2.7 million is the Commercial Services segment. In addition, there was a $3.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, $3.9 million increase in bad debt expense (mainly in the Commercial Services segment) and increases in other general expenses compared to prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased from 24.3% to 22.2% in fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively.

Depreciation, Amortization and (Gain) Loss on Disposal of Assets, Net.
  Depreciation, amortization and (gain) loss on disposal of assets, net, decreased by $4.1 million to $109.1 million for 2024 from $113.2 million for 2023. This was mainly due certain non-compete, trademark and developed technology intangible assets being fully amortized in fiscal year 2024 as compared to the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense in fiscal year 2024.

Goodwill Impairment
. We recorded an impairment loss of $97.1 million in fiscal year 2024 as a result of our 2024 assessment of goodwill impairment in our Parking Solutions segment. See Note 2, 
Significant Accounting Policies, 
for additional information.

Interest Expense, Net. 
 Interest expense, net decreased by $12.8 million from $86.7 million in fiscal year 2023 to $73.9 million in fiscal year 2024. This decrease is primarily attributable to voluntary principal prepayments made during 2023 and 2024 which lowered the outstanding debt balance in 2024 coupled with a 100 basis-point reduction in the interest rate from refinancing our debt in February and in October of fiscal year 2024. The average variable interest rate on the 2021 Term Loan was 44 basis points lower for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior period. See “
Liquidity and Capital Resources
” below.

47

Change in Fair Value of Private Placement Warrants
.  We recorded a loss of $25.0 million for the fiscal year 2023 related to the changes in fair value of our Private Placement Warrants which were accounted for as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The change in fair value was the result of re-measurement of the liability at the end of the reporting period, and the final re-measurement upon their exercise.

Tax Receivable Agreement Liability Adjustment
.  We recorded a gain of approximately $0.3 million in fiscal year 2024 as a result of lower estimated state tax rates due to changes in apportionment. We recorded a gain of approximately $3.1 million in fiscal year 2023 as a result of tax settlement adjustments related to a previous acquisition.

Loss on Interest Rate Swap
.  We recorded a $0.5 million loss in fiscal year 2024 of which $1.3 million is associated with the derivative instrument re-measured to fair value at the end of the reporting period offset by $(0.8) million related to the monthly cash proceeds. We recorded a $0.8 million loss in fiscal year 2023 of which approximately $1.1 million related to the monthly cash payments on the interest rate swap net of $(0.3) million associated with the derivative instrument re-measured to fair value at the end of the reporting period. We exercised our option to cancel the interest rate swap agreement effective the end of the third quarter of 2024.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
.  We recorded a $1.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal year 2024 related to the write-off of pre-existing deferred financing costs and discounts in connection with the February and October 2024 refinancing of the 2021 Term Loan. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $3.5 million for fiscal year 2023 related to the write-off of pre-existing deferred financing costs and discounts in connection with the early repayment of $172.5 million on the 2021 Term Loan.

Other Income, Net.
  Other income, net was $19.0 million in fiscal year 2024 compared to $11.1 million in fiscal year 2023. The increase of approximately $7.9 million is primarily attributable to a $5.6 million tax settlement payment recorded in 2023 related to a prior year acquisition without a comparable amount in 2024, as well as increase in volume rebates earned from total spend on credit card transactions due to increased tolling and travel activity.

Income Tax Provision.  
Income tax provision was $47.7 million representing an effective tax rate of 60.2% for fiscal year 2024 compared to $30.0 million, representing an effective tax rate of 34.5% for fiscal year 2023. Our effective tax rate for 2024 was higher compared to 2023 primarily due to the impact of permanent differences related to the mark-to-market adjustment on the Private Placement Warrants and the impairment adjustments in the Parking Solutions segment.

Net Income.  
We had net income of $31.4 million for fiscal year 2024 compared to a net income of $57.0 million for 2023. The $25.6 million decrease in net income was primarily due to the goodwill impairment recorded in fiscal year 2024, partially offset by the change in fair value of the Private Placement Warrants liability in the prior fiscal year without a comparable amount in the current year, and the other statement of operations activity discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and the available borrowing under our Revolver (defined below).

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows provided by operating activities and our ability to borrow under our Revolver will be sufficient to meet operating cash requirements, service debt obligations and fund potential share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. In addition, our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than currently expected due to various factors, including any expansion of our business or strategic acquisitions.

We have incurred significant long-term debt as a result of acquisitions completed in prior years. Should we pursue strategic acquisitions, we may need to raise additional capital, which may be in the form of additional long-term debt, borrowings on our Revolver, or equity financings, all of which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.

48

We have the ability to borrow under our Revolver to meet obligations as they come due. As of December 31, 2024, we had $74.4 million available for borrowing, net of letters of credit, under our Revolver. Our cash on hand was $77.6 million as of December 31, 2024.

In February 2024 and in October 2024, we refinanced the 2021 Term Loan (as discussed below) which reduced the interest rate by an aggregate 1.00% and eliminated the applicable credit spread adjustment. During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we made early repayments of $9.0 million and $172.5 million, respectively, on the 2021 Term Loan and as a result, the total principal outstanding was $695.6 million as of December 31, 2024.

At December 31, 2024, the tax receivable agreement liability was approximately $48.1 million. We expect to make payments of approximately $5.2 million per year for the next 10 years.

Share Repurchases

In October 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to an aggregate amount of $100.0 million of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock over an 18-month period in open market, ASR or privately negotiated transactions.

In June 2024, we entered into a share repurchase agreement with a stockholder, pursuant to which we repurchased, directly from the stockholder, 2.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $51.5 million. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares through open market transactions and paid $35.8 million. On December 4, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $100 million of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock under the existing October 2023 program, providing us with approximately $112.7 million available for repurchases.

On December 11, 2024, we entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution and paid $112.7 million to receive an initial delivery of 3,821,958 shares of our Class A Common Stock. The final settlement is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2025, at which time, we may receive additional shares calculated using a volume-weighted average price over the term of the ASR agreement.

We paid a total of $200.0 million for share repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2024. All repurchased shares were subsequently retired. In addition, we recorded approximately $1.7 million within accrued liabilities related to the excise taxes payable on net share repurchases on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities increased by $17.5 million, from $206.1 million in fiscal year 2023 to $223.6 million in fiscal year 2024. Net income decreased $25.6 million from $57.0 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to $31.4 million in fiscal year 2024. The aggregate adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities increased by $93.0 million mainly due to the goodwill impairment recorded in the current year and change in deferred income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the change in the fair value of private placement warrants. The aggregate changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased by $49.9 million in 2024 primarily due to a legal settlement accrued in the prior year that was paid in 2024, partially offset by a lower increase in accounts receivable balances year over year as compared to prior year, mainly in our Commercial Services business.

49

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities in fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was primarily related to purchases of installation and service parts and property and equipment mainly in our Government Solutions business of $70.9 million and $57.0 million, respectively.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities was $211.4 million in fiscal year 2024 mainly due to $200 million of share repurchases using existing cash on hand, as well as early repayments on the 2021 Term Loan of a net $9.0 million.

Cash used in financing activities was $117.8 million in fiscal year 2023 mainly due to early repayments totaling $172.5 million on our 2021 Term Loan and $100.0 million of share repurchases, which were partially offset by $161.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of warrants.

Long-term Debt

2021 Term Loan

In March 2021, VM Consolidated, our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement No.1 to the First Lien Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “
2021

Term Loan
”) with a syndicate of lenders. The 2021 Term Loan has an aggregate borrowing of $900.0 million, maturing on March 24, 2028. In connection with the 2021 Term Loan borrowings, we had $4.6 million of offering discount costs and $4.5 million in deferred financing costs, both of which were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining life of the 2021 Term Loan.

In February 2024, VM Consolidated entered into a third amendment (the “
Third Amendment
”) and in October 2024, a fourth amendment (the "
Fourth Amendment
") to refinance the 2021 Term Loan (the “
Refinancing Transactions
”). Pursuant to the Third and Fourth Amendments, the interest rate was reduced by an aggregate 1.00% to SOFR plus 2.25% from SOFR plus 3.25% with the SOFR floor unchanged at 0.00%. The credit spread adjustment, ranging from 0.11448% to 0.71513%, was eliminated. In addition, the 2021 Term Loan no longer contains a provision for principal repayments which were previously required to be paid in quarterly installments.

We evaluated the Refinancing Transactions on a lender-by-lender basis and accounted accordingly for debt extinguishment and debt modification costs (for the portion of the transactions that did not meet the accounting criteria for debt extinguishment).

During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we made early repayments of $9.0 million and $172.5 million, respectively, on the 2021 Term Loan and as a result, the total principal outstanding was $695.6 million as of December 31, 2024.

We recorded $1.7 million of loss on extinguishment of debt during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, primarily related to the write-off of pre-existing deferred financing costs and discounts in connection with the Refinancing Transactions. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, related to the write-off of pre-existing deferred financing costs and discounts in connection with the early repayments.

The 2021 Term Loan bears interest based, at our option, on either (i) Term SOFR plus an applicable margin of 2.25% per annum, or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 1.25% per annum. As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate on the 2021 Term Loan was 6.6%.

In addition, the 2021 Term Loan requires mandatory prepayments equal to the product of the excess cash flows of the Company (as defined in the 2021 Term Loan agreement) and the applicable prepayment percentages (calculated as of the last day of the fiscal year), as set forth in the following table:

We did not have mandatory prepayments of excess cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.

Senior Notes

In March 2021, VM Consolidated issued an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million in Senior Notes, due on April 15, 2029. In connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we incurred $5.7 million in lender and third-party costs, which were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the remaining life of the Senior Notes.

Interest on the Senior Notes is fixed at 5.50% per annum and is payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year. We may redeem all or a portion of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices set forth below in percentages by year, plus accrued and unpaid interest:

PPP Loan

During fiscal year 2020, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries received a $2.9 million loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration (“
SBA
”) as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (“
PPP Loan
”) to offset certain employment and other allowable costs incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, we were notified by the SBA that the loan, together with accrued interest, had been fully forgiven under the provisions of the PPP Loan program. Accordingly, we recognized a $3.0 million gain on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The Revolver

We have a Revolving Credit Agreement (the “
Revolve
r”) with a commitment of up to $75.0 million available for loans and letters of credit. The Revolver matures on December 18, 2026. Borrowing eligibility under the Revolver is subject to a monthly borrowing base calculation based on (i) certain percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory, less (ii) certain reserve items, including outstanding letters of credit and other reserves. The Revolver bears interest on either (1) Term SOFR plus an applicable margin, or (2) an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin. The margin percentage applied to (1) Term SOFR is either 1.25%, 1.50%, or 1.75%, or (2) the base rate is either 0.25%, 0.50%, or 0.75%, depending on our average availability to borrow under the commitment. There is a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% for a one-month duration, 0.15% for a three-month duration, and 0.25% for a six-month duration, in addition to Term SOFR and the applicable margin percentages. There were no outstanding borrowings on the Revolver as of December 31, 2024 or 2023. The availability to borrow was $74.4 million, net of $0.6 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2024.

Interest on the unused portion of the Revolver is payable quarterly at 0.375% and we are also required to pay participation and fronting fees at 1.38% on $0.6 million of outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2024.

51

All borrowings and other extensions of credits under the 2021 Term Loan, Senior Notes and the Revolver are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions and restrictive covenants including absence of defaults and accuracy in material respects of representations and warranties. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral to secure our indebtedness under the 2021 Term Loan. At December 31, 2024, we were compliant with all debt covenants in our debt agreements.

Interest Expense, Net

We recorded interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs and discounts, of $73.9 million, $86.7 million and $69.4 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“
GAAP
”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, 
Significant Accounting Policies,
 in Item 8, 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
, of this Annual Report. We believe that the critical accounting estimates listed below involve our more significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates and, therefore, could have the greatest potential impact on the financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

Judgment is required for the estimation of the standalone selling price (“
SSP
”) and the allocation of the transaction price by relative SSPs. Within our Government Solutions and Parking Solutions operating segments, some customer arrangements include multiple performance obligations. Government Solutions’ customer arrangements containing multiple performance obligations typically include the sale and installation of photo-enforcement cameras, license of back-office software, processing payments on behalf of the customer and the performance of maintenance services on such cameras over a contractual term. Parking Solutions’ customer arrangements containing multiple performance obligations typically include the sale of parking access hardware systems, the licensing of SaaS products, installation and/or the performance of maintenance services over a contractual term. In most instances, we have determined these performance obligations qualify as distinct performance obligations, as the customer can benefit from the service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and our promise to transfer the service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. For arrangements that contain multiple performance obligations, we exercise judgment in allocating the transaction price based on the relative SSP method by comparing the SSP of each distinct performance obligation to the total value of the contract. We apply judgment in determining the SSP for each distinct performance obligation.

See Note 2, 
Significant Accounting Policies
, in Item 8, 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
 for additional information on the Company’s policy for recognition of revenue.

52

Allowance for Credit Losses

We review historical credit losses and customer payment trends on receivables and develop loss rate estimates as of the balance sheet date, which includes adjustments for current and future expectations. We identify pools of receivables based on the type of business, industry in which the customer operates and historical credit loss patterns (for example, receivables from drivers of rental cars). We evaluate the changes in expectations based on the newest information available on customer payment trends, travel forecasts and other risk characteristics and adjusting either upward or downward that is most representative of the expected credit losses. Administration fees charged to drivers of rented vehicles that we cannot recover from our customers represent higher risk of credit loss compared to our other pools of receivables. We periodically evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for expected credit losses and adjust appropriately.

Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets

We assess goodwill for impairment annually on October 1, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable. We have four reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential impairment of goodwill which include Commercial Services, Government Solutions North America, Government Solutions International and Parking Solutions. We first consider the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, we then perform a quantitative impairment test by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting units’ carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. No impairment is recognized if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value.

The process of evaluating goodwill requires significant judgment including the identification of reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a combination of an income approach or more specifically, a discounted cash flow method (“
DCF Method
”) and a market approach employing the public company market multiple method. The DCF Method is based on projected future cash flows and terminal value estimates discounted to their present values using a market-participant weighted average cost of capital. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the DCF Method include forecasts of future revenue growth rates, EBITDA margin percentages, terminal growth rates and discount rates. We apply discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the respective reporting units and our internally developed projections of future cash flows. The market approach utilizes a blend of revenue and EBITDA multiples from guideline public companies which are comparable to us in size, profitability and other factors to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the market approach include the selection of guideline public companies, revenue and EBITDA projections, the selection of revenue and EBITDA multiples and the application of a control premium. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ from those assumed in our analysis. The determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions, and changes in our forecasts, business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments, potentially decreasing the fair value of one or more reporting units. Any resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations.

In connection with our annual impairment assessment, we determined it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were in excess of their carrying value for our Commercial Services, Government Solutions North America and Government Solutions International reporting units based on qualitative factors. We performed a quantitative impairment test for our Parking Solutions reporting unit as of October 1, 2024. This was due to recent performance that unfavorably impacted the Parking Solutions business, including lower revenue growth, higher customer churn and lower profitability margins than previously estimated. The fair value of this reporting unit was determined by equally weighting the results of the DCF and market approach methods described above. Based on the results of its quantitative review, we concluded an impairment to goodwill was necessary because the reporting unit's carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. We recorded a $97.1 million impairment of goodwill in our Parking Solutions segment during fiscal year 2024, which is presented in the goodwill impairment line item on the consolidated statements of operations.

53

We review our long-lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value. Our estimates of cash flows are subjective judgments based on past experiences adjusted for trends and future expectations, and can be significantly impacted by changes in our business or economic conditions. The determination of a asset group's fair value is also subject to significant judgment and utilizes valuation techniques including discounting estimated future cash flows and market-based analyses. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, our operating results may be materially impacted. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a $0.2 million impairment related to the write-down of installation and service parts that no longer had future use within the operating expenses line item in our Government Solutions segment. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a $4.3 million impairment which included a $3.9 million write-down of installation and service parts that no longer had future use within the operating expenses line item in our Government Solutions segment, and $0.4 million impairment of an ROU asset within the selling, general and administrative expenses line item in our Parking Solutions segment. We recorded a $0.7 million of impairment related to certain photo enforcement programs that ended during the year ended December 31, 2022 within the depreciation, amortization and (gain) loss on disposal of assets, net line item on the consolidated statements of operations.

Income Taxes

The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years, while deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that generate a future tax liability for items where deductions have been accelerated for tax purposes. We provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We calculate the valuation allowance in accordance with the authoritative guidance relating to income taxes, which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets when measuring the need for a valuation allowance. Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. The realization of deferred tax assets can be affected by, among other things, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the length of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with utilizing operating loss and other tax carryforwards by jurisdiction, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning alternatives and strategies that may be available. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variation in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.

Private Placement Warrant Liabilities

We accounted for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance. For warrants that met all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants were required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For warrants that did not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants were required to be recorded at their fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants were recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. Our Public Warrants met the criteria for equity classification and accordingly, were reported as a component of shareholders’ equity while our Private Placement Warrants did not meet the criteria for equity classification and were instead classified as a liability. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was estimated at period-end using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which was a Level 3 fair value measurement exposed to valuation risk. As of December 31, 2023, all Warrants were either exercised by the holder or redeemed by the Company.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, refer to Note 2, 
Significant Accounting Policies
, in Item 8, 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat
ive Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on the 2021 Term Loan described in “Item 7. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources
.”

Interest rate risk represents our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates associated with the variable rate debt represented by the 2021 Term Loan, which has an outstanding balance of $695.6 million at December 31, 2024. The 2021 Term Loan bears interest based, at our option, on either (i) Term SOFR plus an applicable margin of 2.25% per annum, or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 1.25% per annum. As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate on the 2021 Term Loan was 6.6%.

Based on the December 31, 2024 balance outstanding, each 1% movement in interest rates will result in an approximately $7.0 million change in annual interest expense.

In December 2022, we entered into a cancellable interest rate swap agreement to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with the LIBOR (now transitioned to Term SOFR) portion of the variable interest rate on our 2021 Term Loan. We exercised our option to cancel the interest rate swap effective the end of the third quarter of 2024.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Verra Mobility Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verra Mobility Corporation (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Goodwill — Parking Solutions Reporting Unit – Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company’s goodwill for its Parking Solutions reporting unit is tested annually for impairment on October 1 of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both market and income approaches, combined with an equal weighting.

57

The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and “EBITDA,” which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. The income approach is based on a discounted cash flow method and requires significant estimates and assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue growth rates, EBITDA margin percentages and the selection of discount rates. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.

During 2024, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $97.1 million for the Parking Solutions reporting unit’s goodwill. After considering the impact of the impairment charges, the carrying amount of the Parking Solutions reporting unit’s goodwill as of December 31, 2024, was $102.1 million.

We identified impairment of the Parking Solutions reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value. The audit of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to future revenue growth rates and EBITDA margin percentages, and the selection of significant valuation assumptions such as comparable company revenue and EBITDA multiples and discount rates. The audit also required an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to revenue growth rates and EBITDA margin percentages and the selection of significant valuation assumptions, such as comparable company revenue and EBITDA multiples and discount rates used by management to estimate the fair value of the Parking Solutions reporting unit included the following procedures:

•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the Parking Solutions reporting unit, such as controls related to management's review of forecasts of future revenue growth rates and EBITDA margin percentages, selection of comparable company revenue and EBITDA multiples and discount rates.

•
We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.

•
We performed a sensitivity analysis of the future revenue growth rates, EBITDA margin percentages, and discount rates, which included their impact on cash flows.

•
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasted revenue growth rates and EBITDA margin percentages by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical results of the Company, (2) internal communications to management and the board of directors, and (3) forecasted information included in industry reports of the Company and companies in its peer groups.  

•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated (1) the valuation methodologies used, (2) the comparable company multiples selected by management, and (3) the discount rates used in determining the present value of the expected cash flows.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Verra Mobility Corporation

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Verra Mobility Corporation (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

VERRA MOBILITY CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLID
ATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.
Description of Business
Verra Mobility Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, the “
Company
” or “
Verra Mobility
”) offers integrated technology solutions and services to its customers who are located throughout the world, primarily within the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe. The Company is organized into 
three
 operating segments: Commercial Services, Government Solutions and Parking Solutions (see Note 17, 
Segment Reporting
).
The Commercial Services segment offers automated toll and violations management and title and registration solutions to rental car companies (“
RACs
”), direct commercial fleet owner-operators (“
Direct Fleets
”) and fleet management companies (“
FMCs
”) and other large fleet owners in North America. Through its established relationships with individual tolling authorities throughout the United States, the segment provides an automated and outsourced administrative solution for its customers while also providing a value-added convenience for vehicle drivers and benefits to tolling and issuing authorities. The toll and violations management solutions help ensure timely payment of tolls and violations incurred by the customers’ vehicles and perform timely transfers of liability on the customers’ behalf, and driver billing and collections, as applicable. It also manages regional toll transponder installation and vehicle association—a critical and highly complex process for RAC, Direct Fleet and FMC customers—to ensure that the transponders (and corresponding toll transactions) are associated with the correct vehicle. In Europe, the Commercial Services segment provides violations processing through Euro Parking Collection plc and consumer tolling services through Pagatelia S.L.U.
The Government Solutions segment offers photo enforcement solutions and services to its customers which include complete, end-to-end speed, red-light, school bus stop arm and bus lane enforcement solutions. These programs are designed to reduce traffic violations and resulting collisions, injuries and fatalities. The Company implements and administers traffic safety programs for municipalities, counties, school districts and law enforcement agencies of all sizes. The international operations for this segment primarily involve the sale of traffic enforcement products and recurring maintenance services related to the equipment and software.
The Parking Solutions segment offers an integrated suite of parking software, transaction processing and hardware solutions to its customers, which include universities, municipalities, healthcare facilities and commercial parking operators. This segment develops specialized hardware and parking management software that provides a platform for the issuance of parking permits, enforcement, gateless vehicle counting, event parking and citation services. It also produces and markets its proprietary software as a service to its customers throughout the United States and Canada.

2.
Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“
GAAP
”).
 All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates and assumptions include those related to allocating the transaction price for revenue recognition, inventory valuation, allowance for credit losses, fair value of the private placement warrant liabilities, fair value of the interest rate swap, self-insurance liability, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions, apportionment for state income taxes, the tax receivable agreement liability, fair value of privately-held securities, impairment assessments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, asset retirement obligations, contingent consideration and the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies.

66

Management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash
The Company collects cash on behalf of customers under certain contracts which it deposits daily into Company bank accounts and transfers regularly to customer bank accounts. Restricted cash primarily represents customer cash collected but not yet remitted to the customer. 
Restricted cash is classified as a current asset and the corresponding liability for amounts due to customers is within current liabilities.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and unbilled receivables. The Company limits cash and cash equivalents to highly rated financial institutions.

Significant customers are those which represent more than 
10
%
 of the Company’s total revenue or ac
counts receivable, net.

as of or for any period presented
.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Accounts receivable and unbilled receivables are uncollateralized customer obligations arising from the sale of products or services. Accounts receivable and unbilled receivables have normal trade terms of less than one year and are initially stated at the amounts billed to the customers and subsequently measured at amortized cost net of allowance for credit losses. Unbilled receivables are recorded when revenues have been earned but have not been included on a customer invoice through the end of the current period. Unbilled receivables were $
48.2

million and $
37.1
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

67

The Company reviews historical credit losses and customer payment trends on receivables and develops loss estimates as of the balance sheet date, which includes adjustments for current and future expectations. It identifies pools of receivables based on the type of business, industry in which the customer operates and historical credit loss patterns. The Company uses collection assumptions (typically at the customer level) to estimate expected credit losses. Receivables are written off against the allowance for credit losses when it is probable that amounts will not be collected based on the terms of the customer contracts, and subsequent recoveries reverse the previous write-off and apply to the receivable in the period recovered. No interest or late fees are charged on delinquent accounts. The Company periodically evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for expected credit losses and adjusts appropriately.
The following presents the activity in the allowance for credit losses by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, respecti
vely:

This primarily consists of receivables from drivers of rental cars for which the Company bills on behalf of its customers. Receivables not collected from drivers within a defined number of days are transferred to customers subject to applicable bad debt sharing agreements. The allowance for credit losses for driver-billed receivables w
as 
85
%
 and 
88
% of the total Commercial Services allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Inventory
Inventories consist of parts and electronic components used in the production of parking management related hardware sold to cer
tain Parking Solutions customers and photo enforcement systems sold to certain Government Solutions customers. Inventories for the Parking Solutions business were stated at cost on a first-in, first-out basis and the total carrying value was approximately $
8.4
 million and $
10.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Inventories for the Government Solutions international business were stated at a weighted average cost and the total carrying value was $
7.1
 million and $
8.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company assesses the value of its inventory and writes down the cost to net realizable value upon evaluation of historical experience and assumptions regarding future usage, and any such write down establishes a new cost basis for the items. Total finished goods were approximately $
3.1
 million and $
3.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Installation and Service Parts
Installation and service parts consist of components used in the construction and maintenance of the Company's photo enforcement systems. Installation and service parts are stated at cost and are reclassified to property and equipment upon initiation of construction and subsequently placed in service. Installation and service parts used in repairs and maintenance are recorded as operating expenses. See 
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
 section below for a discussion of the write-down of installation and service parts that no longer had future use.

68

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. All repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as 
follows:

Equipment

3
-
7 years

Computer equipment

-
5 years

Furniture

3
-
10 years

Automobiles

7 years

Software

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of lease term or estimated useful life

Equipment relates to equipment installed at customer sites and certain installation costs that qualify for capitalization. Software costs include certain internal and external costs associated with the development of software that are incurred during the application development stage. In addition, a modification or upgrade to existing software is capitalized only to the extent it results in additional functionality to existing software. Software mainte
nance and training costs are expensed as incurred.

Investment in Privately-held Securities
The Company holds an investment in privately-held equity securities which is recorded at cost and adjusted based on observable transactions for same or similar investments or for impairment. Investment gains and losses are recorded in other income, net.
Valuation of privately-held securities requires judgment due to the lack of readily available observable market data. The carrying value is not adjusted if there are no identified events that would indicate a need for upward or downward adjustments or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment. In determining the estimated fair value of its investment, the Company utilizes the most recent data available. The Company assesses its investment for impairment quarterly using both qualitative and quantitative factors. If an investment is considered impaired, an impairment loss is recognized and a new carrying value is established for the investment.

There were 
no
 indicators of impairment during the years ended December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023. The Company recorded a $
1.3
 million impairment during the year ended December 31, 2022 within other income, net on the consolidated statements of operations.
Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If, based on a qualitative analysis, it is determined more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. Reporting units are identified by assessing whether the components of the Company’s operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available, if segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components and if any of the components can be aggregated based on economic similarities and other factors. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets (including goodwill) to those reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The date of the Company’s annual impairment analysis is October 1. The Company has four reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential impairment of goodwill which include Commercial Services, Government Solutions North America, Government Solutions International and Parking Solutions.

69

The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units based on a combination of an income approach or more specifically, a discounted cash flow method (“
DCF Method
”) and a market approach employing the public company market multiple method. The DCF Method is based on projected future cash flows and terminal value estimates discounted to their present values using a market-participant weighted average cost of capital. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the DCF Method include forecasts of future revenue growth rates, EBITDA margin percentages, terminal growth rates and discount rates. The Company applies discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the respective reporting units and its internally developed projections of future cash flows. The market approach utilizes a blend of revenue and EBITDA multiples from guideline public companies which are comparable to it in size, profitability and other factors to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the market approach include the selection of guideline public companies, revenue and EBITDA projections, the selection of revenue and EBITDA multiples and the application of a control premium.
In connection with its annual impairment assessment, the Company determined it was more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units were in excess of their carrying values for the Commercial Services, Government Solutions North America and Government Solutions International reporting units based on qualitative factors. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test for its Parking Solutions reporting unit as of October 1, 2024. This was due to recent performance that unfavorably impacted the Parking Solutions business, including lower revenue growth, higher customer churn and lower profitability margins than previously estimated. The fair value of this reporting unit was determined by equally weighting the results of the DCF and market approach methods described above. Based on the results of its quantitative review, the Company concluded an impairment to goodwill was necessary because the reporting unit's carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. The Company recorded a $
97.1
 million impairment of goodwill in the Parking Solutions segment during fiscal year 2024, which is presented in the goodwill impairment line item on the consolidated statements of operations.

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets represent existing customer relationships, trademarks, patents, developed technology (hardware and software) and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, which approximates the utilization of their expected future benefits. Amortization of intangible assets is included in depreciation, amortization and (gain) loss on disposal of assets, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company annually evaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of its intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite useful lives and installation and service parts) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company assesses recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a $
0.2
 million impairment related to the write-down of installation and service parts that no longer had future use within the operating expenses line item in the Government Solutions segment. D
uring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $
4.3
 million impairment which included a $
3.9
 million write-down of installation and service parts that no longer had future use within the operating expenses line item in the Government Solutions segment, and $
0.4
 million impairment of an ROU asset within the selling, general and administrative expenses line item in the Parking Solutions segment. 
The Company had $
0.7
 million of impairment related to certain photo enforcement programs that ended during the year ended December 31, 2022 within the depreciation, amortization and (gain) loss on disposal of assets, net line item on the consolidated statements of operations.

70

Self-Insurance
The Company is self-insured for medical costs and has stop-loss insurance policies to limit its exposure to individual and aggregate claims made. Liabilities for these programs are estimated based on outstanding claims and claims estimated to be incurred but not yet reported using historical loss experience. These estimates are subject to variability due to changes in trends of losses for outstanding claims and incurred but not reported claims, including external factors such as the number, and cost of claims, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns.

Warrants
As of December 31, 2022, there were warrants outstanding to acquire 
19,999,967
 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock including: (i) 
6,666,666
 Private Placement Warrants and (ii) 
13,333,301
 warrants issued in connection with the initial public offering (the “
Public Warrants
” and, together with the Private Placement Warrants, the “
Warrants
”). The Warrants had a five-year term and expired in October 2023, unless they were redeemed or exercised prior to expiration. As of December 31, 2023, all Warrants were either exercised by the holder or redeemed by the Company. See Note 12, 
Shareholders' Equity
, for additional details on warrant exercises.

The Company accounted for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“
FASB
”) ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“
ASC 480
”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“
ASC 815
”). The assessment considered whether the warrants were freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, met the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants met all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants were indexed to the Company’s own common shares, among other conditions for equity classification.

For warrants that met all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants were required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. Warrants that did not meet all the criteria for equity classification were recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants were recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s Public Warrants met the criteria for equity classification and accordingly, were reported as a component of stockholders’ equity while the Company’s Private Placement Warrants were classified as a liability. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was estimated at period-end using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Shares issuable under the Warrants were considered for inclusion in the diluted share count in accordance with GAAP.

Interest Rate Swap

In December 2022, the Company entered into a cancellable interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with the LIBOR (now transitioned to Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate, “
SOFR
”) portion of the variable interest rate on its 2021 Term Loan. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the Company paid a fixed rate of 
5.17
% and the counterparty paid a variable interest rate. The Company entered into an International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. Master Agreement with the counterparty which provided for the net settlement of all, or a specified group, of derivative transactions through a single payment. The notional amount on the interest rate swap was $
675.0
 million. The Company had the option to effectively terminate the interest rate swap agreement starting in December 2023, and monthly thereafter until December 2025. The Company treated the interest rate swap as an economic hedge for accounting purposes and any changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument (including accrued interest) and related cash receipts or payments were recorded in the consolidated statements of operations within the loss (gain) on interest rate swap line item. The Company exercised its option to cancel the interest rate swap agreement during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.
The following details the components of the loss (gain) on interest rate swap for the respective periods:

The effect of remeasurement to fair value was recorded within the operating activities section and the monthly cash proceeds received or payments made were recorded within the investing activities section in the consolidated statements of cash flows. See below for further discussion on the fair value measurement of the interest rate swap.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurement,
 includes a single definition of fair value to be used for financial reporting purposes, provides a framework for applying this definition and for measuring fair value under GAAP, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorizes into three levels the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are summarized as follows:
Level 1
 – Fair value is based on observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2
 – Fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3
 – Fair value is determined using one or more significant inputs that are unobservable in active markets at the measurement date, such as a pricing model, discounted cash flow, or similar technique.
The carrying amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the immediate to short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt was calculated based upon available market information. 
The carrying value and the estimated fair value of long-term debt are as follows:

The Company had issued Private Placement Warrants (as discussed above) to acquire shares of its Class A Common Stock in connection with its initial public offering which had a five-year term and expired in October 2023. During fiscal year 2023, all Private Placement Warrants were exercised by the warrant holders.

The following summarizes the changes in fair value of Private Placement Warrant liabilities included in net income 
and the impact of exercises for the year ended December 31, 2023:

The change in fair value of private placement warrants consisted of adjustments related to the unexercised Private Placement Warrants re-measured to fair value at the end of the reporting period and the final mark-to-market adjustments for the exercised warrants. During the year ended December 31, 2023, 
6.7
 million Private Placement Warrants were exercised, which reduced our Private Placement Warrants liabilities by $
49.0
 million with an offset to common stock at par value and the remaining to additional paid in capital.
The Company has an equity investment measured at cost with a carrying value of 
$
1.9

million and $
2.1
 million as December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, and is only adjusted to fair value if there are identified events that would indicate a need for an upward or downward adjustment or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment. The estimation of fair value requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, such as voting rights and obligations in the securities held, and is therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. There were 
no
 identified events that required a fair value adjustment during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The recurring fair value measurement of the interest rate swap was valued based on observable inputs for similar assets and liabilities including swaption values and other observable inputs for interest rates and yield curves and was classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
The following presents the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap in the gross balances within the below line items for the respective periods:

The Company separately classified the current and non-current components based on the value of settlements due within 12 months (current) and greater than 12 months (non-current). The Company exercised its option to cancel the interest rate swap during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company records obligations to perform certain retirement activities on camera and speed enforcement systems in the period that the related assets are placed in service. Asset retirement obligations are contractual obligations to restore property to its initial state. These obligations, which are initially estimated based on discounted cash flow estimates, are accreted to full value over time through charges to operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The offsetting asset is capitalized as part of the related asset’s carrying value and is depreciated over the asset’s estimated remaining useful life. When events and circumstances indicate that the original estimates used for asset retirement obligations may need revision, the Company reassesses the assumptions used and adjusts the liability appropriately.
Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs consist of the costs incurred to obtain long-term financing, including the Company’s credit facilities (see Note 8, 
Long-Term Debt
). These costs, which are a reduction to long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets, are amortized over the term of the related debt, using the effective interest method for term debt and the straight-line me
thod for revolving credit facilities. Amortization of deferred financing costs for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
4.1
 m
ill
ion, $
4.7
 million and $
5.5
 million respectively.

Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S and international current and deferred income taxes and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of these temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11, 
Income Taxes
, for more information.

Stock-based Compensation
In October 2018, the Company established the Verra Mobility 2018 Equity Incentive Plan which provides for a variety of stock-based awards for issuance to employees and directors. In May 2023, the Company's stockholders approved the Verra Mobility Corporation Amended and Restated 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “
2018 Plan
”), which, among other things, increased the maximum number of shares available for awards by 
5,000,000
 shares. The Company grants RSUs, stock options and PSUs.
The Company recognizes the fair value of RSUs based on the Company’s common stock price at market close on the date of the grant. The Company uses the
 Black-Scholes option pricing model
 to determine the fair value of stock options, and uses the 
Monte Carlo simulation model t
o determine the fair value of PSUs containing market conditions. The Black-Scholes model requires an assumption regarding the expected life of the stock option, which the Company estim
ated to be 
6.25
 years 
by applying the short-cut method permitted under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110. PSUs granted vest at the end of a three-year period (or ratably over three years for certain grants), which matches the awards’ performance period. RSUs and stock options vest based on the continued service of the recipient. PSUs are issued upon continued service along with the relative satisfaction of a market condition that measures the Company’s total stockholder return relative to a comparably calculated return for a peer group during the performance period or to the Company's absolute total stockholder return. In addition, the Black-Scholes and the Monte Carlo models require assumptions to be made regarding the expected volatility of the Company’s stock price. Stock price volatility is determined by averaging an implied volatility with the measure of historical volatility for stock options and using the historical volatility for PSUs.
The following represents our weighted average assumptions for stock options and PSUs granted for the respective p
eriods:

Compensation expense for share-based awards is determined based on the grant date fair value. The Company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the share-based award. The compensation expense for the PSUs is recognized over the requisite service period regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. See Note 13, 
Equity Incentive Plan
, for more information on the Company’s share-based awards.

74

Revenue Recognition
Nature of Goods and Services
The following is a description of principal activities, separated by reportable segments, from which the Company generates revenue:
Commercial Services
.    The Commercial Services segment offers toll and violation management solutions for commercial fleet operators, including RACs, Direct Fleets and FMCs. The Company determined its performance obligation is a distinct stand-ready obligation, as there is an unspecified quantity of services provided that does not diminish, and the customer is being charged only when it uses the Company’s services, such as toll payment, title and registration, etc. Payment terms for contracts with commercial fleet and rental car companies vary, but are usually billed as services are performed. The Company recognizes revenue over time based on the number of transactions processed on behalf of customers during the period. It recognizes revenue on a net basis when it acts as an agent in the transaction.
Government Solutions.   
The Government Solutions segment principally generates revenue by providing complete, end-to-end speed, red-light, school bus stop arm, and bus lane enforcement solutions. Products, when sold, are typically sold together with the services in a bundle for a majority of customers. The average initial term of a contract is 
three
 to
 five years
. Payment terms for contracts with government agencies vary depending on whether the consideration is fixed or variable. Payment terms for contracts with fixed consideration are usually based on equal installments over the duration of the contract. Payment terms for contracts with variable consideration are usually billed and collected as citations are issued or paid. Certain mobile speed programs are billed per camera system deployed. In instances when the consideration expected from the customer is subject to variation, any variable consideration affecting revenue recognition is allocated to the distinct period (the monthly period) that it relates to.

•
Product sales (sale of camera systems and installation) – the camera systems and related installation services are an integrated solution and are accounted for as a single performance obligation. The revenues for this performance obligation are recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer. 
•
Service revenue – the Company provides a suite of services which may include camera maintenance, processing images taken by the camera, forwarding eligible images to the police department and processing payments on behalf of the municipality. The Company concluded that the suite of services as a whole represents one service offering and is a single performance obligation. The service offering is accounted for as a single continuous service. The Company applies the series guidance for those services as it stands ready to deliver those services over the contract period. The Company recognizes revenue from services over time, as they are performed.
Many of the Company’s customer contracts include both product sales and service revenue. The Company applies judgment when determining whether the product sales and service offering are accounted for as combined performance obligation or distinct performance obligations. In contracts where title to the camera system does not transfer to the customer, the Company accounts for the contract as a single, combined performance obligation. This is because the customer receives the right to use the photo enforcement system and the service offering concurrently. For other contracts, the Company accounts for the products and services as distinct performance obligations because the camera systems and the related service solution are both capable of being distinct and are not highly interdependent and interrelated.

75

In contracts with multiple performance obligations, consideration is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices (“
SSP
”). The Company estimates the SSP for its product sales using expected cost plus margin. The Company is unable to establish the SSP for its service offering based on observable prices as the services are sold for a wide range of amounts (the selling price is highly variable). As such, the SSP for service offerings included in these contracts is generally determined by applying a residual approach.
Parking Solutions
.   The T2 Systems business offers an integrated suite of parking software, transaction processing and hardware solutions to its customers. Revenue is derived primarily from the sale of software as a service (“
SaaS
”) and specialized hardware. For bundled offerings, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct and allocates the transaction price based on the relative SSP. The Company is able to establish the SSP for its product sales based on the observable prices of products sold separately in comparable transactions. For professional services, the Company’s estimate of the standalone selling price is comprised of multiple factors which include a cost plus margin approach and the historical sales price of similar services. The Company is unable to establish the SSP for its software licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold at a broad range of prices and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence, as such, the SSP for software licenses included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach. The Company’s estimates of SSP are reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change.
•
The Company’s hosted parking management software products provide customers the ability to manage access to their parking lots and garages, issue physical or virtual parking permits and manage citations issued through enforcement devices. Revenue derived from these SaaS products is recognized ratably over the contractual service period beginning on the date the service is made available to the customer.
•
Service revenue derived from the Company’s professional services is recognized over time as the services are performed. Revenues for fixed-price service projects are generally recognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to completion.
•
Revenue from product sales is recognized at a point in time when a customer takes control of the hardware, which typically occurs when the product is delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer. 

Remaining Performance Obligations
Deferred revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced in advance which are expected to be recognized as revenue in future periods, and it primarily relates to the Government Solutions and Parking Solutions customers. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had approximately $
11.8
 million and $
13.1
 million of deferred revenue in the Government Solutions segment, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $
6.7
 million and $
5.2
 million, respectively, of revenue, excluding exchange rate impact, related to amounts that were included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had approximately $
21.7
 million and $
19.7
 million of deferred revenue in the Parking Solutions segment, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $
18.7
 million and $
20.7
 million, respectively, of revenue related to amounts that were included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Remaining performance obligations represent the amount of contracted future revenue not yet recognized as the amounts relate to undelivered performance obligations, including both deferred revenue and non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. The Company elected the practical expedients to omit disclosure for the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations with original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that relates to variable consideration allocated to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation to transfer a distinct good or service within a series of distinct goods or services that form a single performance obligation. As of December 31, 2024, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations in the Government Solutions segment that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was $
203.0
 million, of which $
88.0
 million is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next twelve months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period.

76

Credit Card Rebates
The Company earns volume rebates from total spend on purchasing cards and recognizes the income in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company rec
orded $
18.9
 mi
llion, $
17.8
 million, and $
14.5
 million respectively, related to rebates.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, w
ere $
1.6
 m
illion
, $
1.1
 million and $
1.0
 million, respectively, and were included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Foreign Currency
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that differ from their functional currencies are re-measured at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. The foreign currency effect of the re-measurement is included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The impact of foreign currency re-measurement 
was losses of $
0.4

million, $
1.7
 million and $
0.7
 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates while revenue and expenses are translated from functional currencies at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting Standards Adopted
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “
FASB
”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“
ASU
”) 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. The ASU was intended to enhance disclosure related to significant segment expenses regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“
CODM
”), amounts presented as “other” within segment profit (loss), require that all annual disclosures are also reported for interim periods, further define the CODM and how they use segment profit (loss) to allocate resources, and require that entities with only a single reportable segment provide all required segment disclosures. The Company adopted this standard as of December 31, 2024 which included providing relevant disclosures within Note 17, 
Segment Reporting; 
however, there were no other impacts from the adoption of this standard.
In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, 
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions
. The ASU clarified that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. It also required entities with investments in equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions to disclose certain qualitative and quantitative information about such securities. The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2024. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the Company's financial statements or disclosures.

77

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. The ASU requires companies to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation, provide additional disclosure for reconciling items that exceed proscribed thresholds, and enhance disclosure regarding income taxes paid and sources of income (loss) from continuing operations including the tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements and disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement- Reporting Comprehensive Income-

Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. The ASU requires public companies to disclose, in the notes to financial statements, specified information about certain costs and expenses at each interim and annual reporting period at a disaggregated level. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial statements and disclosures.

2021

Term Loan
”) with a syndicate of lenders. The 2021 Term Loan has an aggregate borrowing of $
900.0
 million, maturing on 
March 24, 2028
. In connection with the 2021 Term 
Loan borrowings, the Company had $
4.6
 million of offering discount costs and $
4.5
 million in deferred financing costs, both of which were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining life of the 2021 Term Loan.

In February 2024, VM Consolidated entered into a third amendment (the “
Third Amendment
”) and in October 2024, a fourth amendment (the “
Fourth Amendment
”) to refinance the 2021 Term Loan (the “
Refinancing Transactions
”). Pursuant to the Third and Fourth Amendments, the interest rate was reduced by an aggregate 
1.00
% to SOFR plus 
2.25
% from SOFR plus 
3.25
%, with the SOFR floor unchanged at 
0.00
%. The credit spread adjustment, ranging from 
0.11448
% to 
0.71513
%, was eliminated. In addition, the 2021 Term Loan no longer contains a provision for principal repayments which were previously required to be paid in quarterly installments. The Company evaluated the Refinancing Transactions on a lender-by-lender basis and accounted accordingly for debt extinguishment and debt modification costs (for the portion of the transactions that did not meet the accounting criteria for debt extinguishment).

During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the Company made early repayments of
 $
9.0

million and $
172.5
 million, respectively, on the 2021 Term Loan and as a result, the total principal outstanding was 
$
695.6
 mi
llion as of December 31, 2024.
The Company recorded
 $
1.7

million of loss on extinguishment of debt during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 primarily related to the write-off of pre-existing deferred financing costs and discounts in connection with the Refinancing Transactions. It recognized 
a loss on extinguishment of debt of $
3.5
 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, related to the 
write-off of pre-existing deferred financing costs and discounts in connection with the early repayments.

The 2021 Term Loan bears interest based at the Company’s option, on either (i) Term SOFR plus an applicable margin of 
2.25
% per annum, or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 
1.25
% per annum. As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate on the 2021 Term Loan 
was 
6.6
%.

81

In addition, the 2021 Term Loan requires mandatory prepayments equal to the product of the excess cash flows of the Company (as defined in the 2021 Term Loan agreement) and the applicable prepayment percentages (calculated as of the last day of the fiscal year), as set forth in the following table:

The Company did not have mandatory prepayments of excess cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.

Senior Notes
In March 2021, VM Consolidated issued an aggregate principal amount of $
350.0
 million in Senior Unsecured Notes (the “
Senior Notes
”), due on
 April 15, 2029
. In connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the Company incurred $
5.7
 million in lender and third-party costs, which were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the remaining life of the Senior Notes.
Interest on the Senior Notes is fixed at 
5.50
% per annum and is
 payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year.
 T
he Company may redeem all or a portion of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices set forth below in percentages by year, plus accrued and unpaid interest:

PPP Loan

During fiscal year 2020, one of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries received a $
2.9
 million loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration (“
SBA
”) as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (“
PPP Loan
”) to offset certain employment and other allowable costs incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, the Company was notified by the SBA that the loan, together with accrued interest, had been fully forgiven under the provisions of the PPP Loan program. Accordingly, the Company recognized a $
3.0
 million gain on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The Revolver

The Company has a Revolving Credit Agreement (the “
Revolver
”) with a commitment of up to $
75.0
 million available for loans and letters of credit. The Revolver matures on December 18, 2026. Borrowing eligibility under the Revolver is subject to a monthly borrowing base calculation based on (i) certain percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory, less (ii) certain reserve items, including outstanding letters of credit and other reserves. The Revolver bears interest on either (1) Term SOFR plus an applicable margin, or (2) an alternate base rate, plus an applicable margin. The margin percentage applied to (1) Term SOFR is either 
1.25
%, 
1.50
%, or 
1.75
%, or (2) the base rate is either 
0.25
%, 
0.50
%, or 
0.75
%, depending on the Company’s average availability to borrow under the commitment. There is a credit spread adjustment of 
0.10
% for a one-month duration, 
0.15
% for a three-month duration, and 
0.25
% for a six-month duration, in addition to Term SOFR and the applicable margin percentages. There wer
e 
no
 ou
tstanding borrowings on the Revolver as of December 31, 2024 or 2023. The availability to borrow w
as $
74.4
 mil
lion, net 
of $
0.6
 million
 of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2024.

Interest on the unused portion of the Revolver is payable quarterly at 
0.375
% and the Company is also required to pay participation and fronting fees at 
1.38
% o
n $
0.6
 million of
 outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2024.

82

All borrowings and other extensions of credits under the 2021 Term Loan, Senior Notes and the Revolver are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions and restrictive covenants including absence of defaults and accuracy in material respects of representations and warranties. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are pledged as collateral to secure the Company’s indebtedness under the 2021 Term Loan. At December 31, 2024, the Company was compliant with all debt covenants in its debt agreements.

Interest Expense, Net

The Company recorded interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs and discounts, of $
73.9
 million, $
86.7
 million and $
69.4
 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively.

The weighted average effective interest rates on the Company’s outstanding borrowings 
were 
6.2
% a
nd 
7.7
% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

9.
Leases
The Company’s operating leases primarily consist of office, equipment and vehicle leases expiring at various dates throug
h 
April 2035
. The
 Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and has elected to account for such components as a single lease component. The Company measures and recognizes contracts containing a lease and determines lease classification at commencement. Right of use operating assets and lease liabilities are measured based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate when the rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is based upon information available at lease commencement including publicly available data for debt instruments. The lease term includes periods covered by options to extend when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise such options as well as periods subsequent to an option to terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain the Company will not exercise the termination option. Certain of the lease agreements have rent abatement and escalating rental payment provisions. Operating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease costs are recognized as incurred. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. The Company does not have material short-term leases and does not engage in material subleasing activities.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, operating leases had a remaining weighted average lease term of 
7.5
 years and 
8.0
 years, respectively, and operating lease liabilities were measured using a weighted average discount rate of 
5.8
% and 
5.4
%, respectively. The total operating lease costs for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
9.3
 million, $
9.5
 million and $
8.8
 million, respectively. Variable lease costs for fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $
3.8
 million, $
2.7
 million and $
1.5
 million, respectively. Finance leases for the Company were not material.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company presented $
34.7
 million and $
27.5
 million, respectively, of deferred tax assets, net, to reflect U.S. entity deferred taxes within other non-current assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company has provided income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries, except to the extent such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. The amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary differences is approximately $
0.8
 million.

In accordance with ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
, deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets can be affected by, among other things, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, limitations on the use of acquired tax attributes due to an ownership change under IRC section 382, the length of statutory carryforward periods, the Company’s experience with utilizing operating losses and tax credit carryforwards by jurisdiction, and tax planning alternatives and strategies that may be available.
The Company performed an analysis of the reversal of the deferred tax assets and considered the overall business environment, historical earnings, the outlook for future years and the impact of limitations on the use of acquired tax attributes due to an ownership change under IRC section 382. The Company determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized as of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and as such provided a valuation al
lowance of $
5.5
 mill
ion and $
7.0
 million, respectively. The valuation allowance could be adjusted in future periods if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present.

86

The net operating loss carryforwards represent 
$
103.0
 m
illion and $
118.0
 million of federal, state and foreign net operating losses at Decemb
er 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforward at December 31, 2024 consists of $
13.0
 million of losses that were generated after 2017 with no expiration date. The Company also has certain tax credits of $
3.8
 million and $
4.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which if unused will begin to expire in 
2025
.

n of tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to $
6.1
 million within the coming year due to prior year tax positions related to tax elections for certain U.S. legal entities.

The Company 
recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The Company recognized $
1.0
 million for fiscal year 2024 and $
0.7
 million for fiscal year 2023 in interest and penalties. The Company had accrued interest and penalties of $
2.2
 million
 and $
1.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based on technical merits, it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained under examination.
The Company is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The Company files U.S. federal and various foreign income tax returns which are subject to examination by the taxing authorities in the respective jurisdictions, generally for three or four years after they are filed. The Co
mpany’s state income tax returns are generally no longer subject to income tax examination by tax authorities prior to 2020; however, the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards arising prior to that year are subject to adjustment. The Company is currently under audit by various state tax jurisdictions for the years 
2018
 through 
2020
; however, no material adjustments are anticipated. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of tax deficiencies i
n each of the tax jurisdictions and, accordingly, makes appropriate adjustments to the tax provision as deemed necessary.

 shares of Class A Common Stock, and (ii) 
1,000,000
 sha
res of preferred stock, each at par value of $

Share Repurchases and Retirement - 2022
In May 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to an aggregate amount of $
125.0
 million of its outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock over a twelve-month period. The Company repurchased a total of 
7.9
 million shares through ASRs and open market transactions during fiscal year 2022. The Company accounted for each ASR transaction as a common stock repurchase and a forward contract indexed to its own common stock. The Company determined that the equity classification criteria was met for the forward contracts, therefore, it did not account for them as derivative instruments.

The Company paid a total of $
125.0
 million for shares repurchases and $
0.1
 million for direct costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 and accounted for the transactions by deducting the par value from the common stock, reducing $
15.9
 million from additional paid-in capital calculated using an average share price, and by increasing accumulated deficit for the remaining cost of $
109.1
 million.

Share Repurchases and Retirement - 2023
In November 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to an aggregate amount of $
100.0
 million of the Company's outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock over an 18-month period.

The Company paid $
8.1
 million to repurchase 
449,432
 shares of its Class A Common Stock through open market transactions during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which it subsequently retired. On September 5, 2023, the Company used the remaining availability under the share repurchase program for an ASR and paid approximately $
91.9
 million to receive an initial delivery of 
4,131,551
 shares of its Class A Common Stock in accordance with an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution. The final settlement occurred on January 12, 2024, at which time, the Company received 
534,499
 additional shares calculated using a volume-weighted average price over the term of the ASR agreement. The Company accounted for the ASR as a common stock repurchase and a forward contract indexed to its own common stock. The Company determined that the equity classification criteria was met for the forward contract, therefore, it did not account for it as a derivative instrument.
The Company paid a total of $
100.0
 million for share repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2023, and accounted for the transactions by deducting the par value from common stock, reducing $
15.2
 million from additional paid-in capital calculated using an average share price, and by increasing accumulated deficit for the remaining cost of $
84.8
 million.

Share Repurchases and Retirement - 2024
In October 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new 
share repurchase program for up to an aggregate amount of $
100.0
 million of its outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock over an 18-month period in open market, ASR or privately negotiated transactions.

In June 2024, the Company entered into a share repurchase agreement with a stockholder, pursuant to which the Company repurchased, directly from the stockholder, 
2.0
 million shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $
51.5
 million. 
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 
1.5
 million shares through open market transactions and paid $
35.8
 million. On December 4, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $
100
 million of its outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock under the existing October 2023 program
, providing the Company with approximately $
112.7
 million available for repurchases
.

88

On December 11, 2024, 
the Company entered into an ASR agreement with a third-party financial institution and paid $
112.7
 million to receive an initial delivery of 
3,821,958
 shares of its Class A Common Stock. The final settlement is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2025, at which time, the Company expects to receive additional shares calculated using a volume-weighted average price over the term of the ASR agreement. 
The Company accounted for the ASR as a common stock repurchase and a forward contract indexed to its own common stock. The Company determined that the equity classification criteria was met for the forward contract, therefore, it did not account for it as a derivative instrument. All repurchased shares were subsequently retired.
The 2023 ASR's final settlement on January 12, 2024 (discussed above) was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company paid a total of $
200.0
 million for share repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2024, and accounted for all share repurchase transactions by deducting the par value from common stock, reducing $
26.8
 million from additional paid-in capital calculated using an average share price, and by increasing accumulated deficit for the remaining cost of $
173.2
 million. In addition, the Company recorded approximately $
1.7
 million within accrued liabilities related to the excise taxes payable on net share repurchases on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024.

13.
Equity Incentive Plan
In October 2018, the Company established the Verra Mobility 2018 Equity Incentive Plan which provides for a variety of stock-based awards including restricted stock units (“
RSUs
”), performance share units (“
PSUs
”) and non-qualified stock options to employees and non-employee directors. In May 2023, the stockholders approved the Verra Mobility Corporation Amended and Restated 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “
2018 Plan
”), which, among other things, increased the maximum number of shares available for awards by 
5,000,000
 shares. The maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be subject to awards under the 2018 Plan was 
15,864,000
 a
s of December 31, 2024, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the 2018 Plan. At December 31, 2024, the Company had an aggregate o
f 
6,500,840
 sh
ares of common stock available for future grants under the 2018 Plan.

89

RSUs and PSUs

The Company’s RSUs consist of a right to receive shares on one or more vesting dates in the future. RSUs granted to employees vest ratably over 
four years
 (or over two years for certain grants) from their individual award dates, subject to continued employment on the applicable vesting dates. RSUs granted to non-employee directors vest on the earlier of (a) the first anniversary of the vesting start date, or (b) the date immediately prior to the next annual stockholders meeting held by the Company occurring after the date of grant.
The Company grants PSUs to senior executives which consist of a right to receive shares generally at the end of a three-year period (or ratably over three years for certain grants). PSUs are issued upon continued service along with the relative satisfaction of a market condition that generally measures either the Company’s total stockholder return relative to a comparably calculated return for a peer group during the performance period or to the Company's absolute total stockholder return. The level at which the performance condition is attained upon the completion of the performance period determines the actual number of shares of the Class A Common Stock into which the PSUs will be converted. The conversion percentage ranges from 
0
% up to 
150
% of the target level.

”) with PE Greenlight Holdings, LLC. On August 3, 2022, PE Greenlight Holdings, LLC sold and transferred to Lakeside Smart Holdco L.P (“

 $
70.0

million, and recorded an initial liability and corresponding charge to equity at the inception of the Tax Receivable Agreement.
At December 31, 2024, the Tax Receivable Agreement liability was $

 million of which approximately $
5.1
 million was the current portion and $

 million in fiscal year 2023 as a result of tax settlement adjustments related to a previous acquisition. 
It recorded a gain of $
0.7

Earn-Out Agreement
Under the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the “
Merger Agreement
”), pursuant to which the Company became the owner, directly or indirectly, of all of the equity interests of Verra Mobility Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries, PE Greenlight Holdings, LLC was entitled to receive additional shares of Class A Common Stock (the “
Earn-Out Shares
”
) if the volume weighted average closing sale price of one share of Class A Common Stock on the Nasdaq exceeded certain defined thresholds for a period of at least 
10
 days out of 
20
 consecutive trading days at any time during a 
five-year
 period. There were four tranches of contingent shares under the agreement, with each tranche resulting in an issuance of 
2,500,000
 shares of Class A Common Stock (not to exceed a total of 
10,000,000
 shares). On April 26, 2019 and January 27, 2020, the criteria for the issuance of the first and second tranches was met and as a result, an aggregate 
5,000,000
 Earn-out Shares were issued. On June 14, 2023 and July 26, 2023, the criteria for the issuance of the remaining tranches of Earn-out Shares was met and the Company issued an aggregate 
5,000,000
 shares, which resulted in an increase in the Company's common stock and additional paid-in capital accounts of approximately $
36.6
 million with a corresponding decrease to the common stock contingent consideration account. As of December 31, 2023, all contingent shares have been issued under the Merger Agreement.

Commitments and Contingencies
The Company

2.3
 milli
on of bank guarantees at December 31, 2024 required to support bids and contracts with certain international customers.

92

The Company has non-cancelable purchase com
mitments to certain vendors. The aggregate non-cancelable purchase commitments outstanding at December 31, 2024 were $

 million. The majority of these outstanding commitments are expected to be incurred in the next twelve months and approximately $
8.6
 million

The Company is subject to tax audits in the normal course of business and does not have material contingencies recorded related to such audits.
The Company accrues for claims and contingencies when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. As of the end of each applicable reporting period, the Company reviews each of its matters and, where it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred, the Company accrues for all probable and reasonably estimable losses. Where the Company can reasonably estimate a range of loss it may incur regarding such a matter, the Company records an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes its best estimate. If the Company can reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other, the Company uses the amount that is the low end of such range.
Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to legal and regulatory actions that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it believes it is probable a loss will be incurred, and the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. The assessment as to whether a loss is probable, reasonably possible or remote, and as to whether a loss or a range of such loss is estimable, often involves significant judgment about future events. The Company has accrued estimated amounts related to legal proceedings as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The ultimate cost of litigation or settlement of one or more of the following cases could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Brantley v. City of Gretna
 is a class action lawsuit filed in the 24th Judicial District Court of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana against the City of Gretna (the “
City
”) and its safety camera vendor, Redflex Traffic Systems, Inc. in April 2016. The Company acquired Redflex Traffic Systems, Inc. as part of its June 2021 purchase of Redflex Holdings Limited. The plaintiff class, which was certified on March 30, 2021, alleges that the City’s safety camera program was implemented and operated in violation of local ordinances and the state constitution, including that the City’s hearing process violated the plaintiffs’ due process rights for lack of a “neutral” arbiter of liability for traffic infractions. Plaintiffs seek recovery of traffic infraction fines paid. The City and Redflex Traffic Systems, Inc. appealed the trial court’s ruling granting class certification, which was denied and their petition for discretionary review of the certification ruling by the Louisiana Supreme Court was declined. Discovery has concluded and trial is scheduled for March 2025.
PlusPass Inc. (“
PlusPass
”) v. Verra Mobility Corporation, et al
. is a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court, Central District of California, against Verra Mobility, The Gores Group LLC, Platinum Equity LLC and ATS Processing Services, Inc., in November 2020. In February 2024, Verra Mobility and PlusPass entered into a confidential business arrangement pursuant to which Verra Mobility (i) acquired certain assets from PlusPass and (ii) fully and finally resolved all litigation and disputes between the parties, including the payment of the settlement amount during the first quarter of 2024.

17.
Segment Reporting
The Company has 
three
 operating and reportable segments, Commercial Services, Government Solutions and Parking Solutions. 
Commercial Services offers toll and violation management solutions and title and registration services to RACs, Direct Fleets, FMCs and violation-issuing authorities. Government Solutions implements and administers traffic safety programs and products for municipalities and government agencies of all sizes. Parking Solutions provides an integrated suite of parking software and hardware solutions to its customers.

The operating and reportable segments were determined based on how the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (“
CODM
”) regularly reviews the operating results of the various components of the Company for which discrete financial information is available, including based on the nature of the products and services and the type of customer. The Company defines the CODM as its Chief Executive Officer. The Company's CODM primarily uses actual revenues and segment profit (defined below) as compared to previously budgeted amounts to evaluate the operating performance, allocate resources and deploy capital to the segments.

Segment performance is based on revenues and income from operations before depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. The measure also excludes interest expense, net, income taxes and certain other transactions and is inclusive of other income, net. The tables below refer to this measure as segment profit. The aforementioned items are not indicative of operating performance, and, as a result are not included in the measures that are reviewed by the CODM for the segments. Other income, net included in segment profit below consists primarily of credit card rebates earned on the prepayment of tolling transactions and gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, and excludes certain non-operating expenses inapplicable to segments.

The Company adopted ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
in fiscal year 2024, and as a result, updated the presentation of financial information by reportable segment. The measure of segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2024 excludes certain costs within operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses that were previously allocated to the segments, in order to align with how the CODM reviews the information regularly. In addition, the CODM does not use discrete asset information to evaluate operating performance at the segment level, as such, the Company has not reported assets disaggregated by reportable segment.
The following tables set forth financial information by segment for the fiscal yea
rs ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

s and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.

Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed and operated effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“
COSO
”) of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which report appears herein.

Remediation of Material Weakness

We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. In connection with our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness in the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting in the Control Activities component of the COSO framework related to a lack of information technology general controls to prevent the risk of management override. Specifically, we identified system limitations that do not facilitate proper segregation of duties within multiple systems and a lack of mitigating business process level controls to address the risk of management override over the preparation and review of manual journal entries and certain manual revenue invoices. While this deficiency did not result in any material misstatements of our consolidated interim or annual financial statements, it did represent a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.

97

Since the fourth quarter of 2023, management executed plans to remediate the above material weakness which included:

•
Hiring experienced personnel in the Government Solutions segment with prior public accounting and public company experience, technical accounting experience, and financial reporting experience. 

•
Implementing system enforced segregation of duties within our accounting and close process.

•
Implementing information technology general controls reducing the risk of management override. 

Based on the implementation work and the results of testing performed, our management concluded that the previously identified material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2024.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Changes in Internal Control over Financing Reporting

For the quarter ended December 31, 2024, except for the remediation efforts noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B. Other
 Information

adopted

terminated
 a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement. (as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
