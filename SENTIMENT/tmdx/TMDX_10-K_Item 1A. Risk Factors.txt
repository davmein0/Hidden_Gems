Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Material Contractual Obligations

Our contractual obligations include amounts payable as principal and interest payments under the CIBC Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, our outstanding principal balance was $60.0 million, which is repayable in equal monthly installments starting in July 2026 until its maturity in July 2027. We estimate we will pay $3.9 million in interest payments during 2025. Our estimate of payments is based on an assumed rate of 6.4%, which was the interest rate in effect at December 31, 2024.

On May 11, 2023, we issued $460.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 1.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2028, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.

We lease facilities under long-term non-cancelable operating leases that have a weighted average remaining lease term of 3.7 years as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $10.3 million, of which $3.3 million is payable during 2025. We also lease facilities under short-term leases, for which we expect to pay approximately $1.5 million in 2025 under existing leases.

76

We intend to acquire additional fixed-wing aircraft as we scale our fleet of aircraft. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we acquired eight transplant-related fixed-wing aircraft with an aggregate purchase price of $109.6 million and we plan to acquire additional aircraft in 2025, including two aircraft purchased in January 2025 and February 2025 with an aggregate purchase price of $28.4 million.

In January 2021, we entered into an unconditional $9.5 million purchase commitment in the ordinary course of business, for goods with specified annual minimum quantities to be purchased through December 2029. The contract is not cancellable without penalty. As of December 31, 2024, our remaining purchase commitment is $5.0 million.

We also enter into other contracts in the normal course of business with consulting firms, material suppliers and other third parties for clinical trials and testing and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain material minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior written notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including noncancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date of cancellation. These payments are not included in the discussion above as the amount and timing of such payments are not known.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

We generate net product revenue primarily from sales of our single-use, organ-specific disposable sets used on our organ-specific OCS Consoles. To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from the sale of OCS Consoles to customers and the implied rental of OCS Consoles loaned to customers at no charge. For each new transplant procedure, these customers purchase an additional OCS disposable set for use on their existing organ-specific OCS Console. We also generate service revenue by providing outsourced organ procurement, OCS perfusion management and transplant logistics services under our NOP in the United States.

We recognize revenue from sales to customers applying the following five steps: (1) identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.

Substantially all of our customer contracts have multiple-performance obligations that contain deliverables consisting of OCS Perfusion Sets and OCS Solutions. Customer contract deliverables may also include organ procurement, OCS perfusion management and transplant logistics services under our NOP or OCS Console, whether sold or loaned to the customer. We evaluate each promise within a multiple-performance obligation arrangement to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation. The primary performance obligations in our customer arrangements from which we derive revenue are the OCS Perfusion Sets, the OCS Solutions, the OCS Console, organ procurement, OCS perfusion management and transplant logistics services.

When a customer order includes an OCS Console, we have determined that customer training and the equipment set-up of the OCS Console, each performed by us, are not distinct because they are not sold on a standalone basis and can only be performed by us in conjunction with a sale or loan of our OCS Console. In addition, we have determined that the OCS Console itself is not distinct because the customer cannot benefit from the OCS Console without the training and equipment set-up having been completed. As a result, when the order includes an OCS Console, we have concluded that training, OCS Console equipment set-up, and the OCS Console itself are highly interdependent and represent a single, combined performance obligation. We recognize revenue from the single, combined performance obligation only once the OCS Console has arrived at the customer site and the training and equipment set-up have been completed by us.

77

Customer orders may include the loan of an OCS Console as well as OCS disposable sets used in each transplant procedure. When we loan the OCS Console to the customer, we retain title to the console at all times and do not require minimum purchase commitments from the customer related to any OCS products. In such cases, we invoice the customer for OCS disposable sets based on customer orders received for each new transplant procedure and the prices set forth in the customer agreement. Over time, we typically recover the cost of the loaned OCS Console through the customer’s continued purchasing and use of additional OCS disposable sets. For these reasons, we have determined that part of the arrangement consideration for the disposable set is an implied rental payment for use of the OCS Console. Therefore, we allocate the arrangement consideration between the lease deliverables (i.e., the OCS Console) and non-lease deliverables (i.e., the OCS disposable sets) based on the relative estimated standalone selling price of each distinct performance obligation. To date, the amounts allocated to lease deliverables have been insignificant.

Revenue from sales to customers of OCS Perfusion Sets, OCS Solutions and OCS Consoles is classified as net product revenue in the our consolidated statements of operations. Revenue from sales to customers of organ procurement, OCS perfusion management and transplant logistics services is classified as service revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.

Revenue is recognized when control is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the product or services. When a customer order includes disposable sets and organ procurement, OCS perfusion management or transplant logistics services, we have determined that the disposable sets and services constitute separate performance obligations and we recognize revenue as the disposable sets and services are each delivered to the customer.

Payments Made to Customers

Under some of our customer clinical trial agreements, we made payments to our customers for reimbursements of clinical trial materials and for specified clinical documentation related to their use of our OCS products. We also make payments to customers involved in post-approval studies for information related to the transplant procedures performed. We determine the appropriate accounting treatments for these payments depending on the nature of the payment and whether they are for distinct goods or services.

Other Revenue Considerations

We only include estimated variable amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We do not assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are deemed immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer. Additionally, we do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer will be one year or less. Revenue is reported net of taxes.

Valuation of Inventory

We value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost computed using the first-in, first-out method. We regularly review inventory quantities on-hand for excess and obsolete inventory and, when circumstances indicate, record charges to write down inventories to their estimated net realizable value, after evaluating historical sales, future demand, market conditions and expected product life cycles. Such charges are classified as cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. Any write-down of inventory to net realizable value creates a new cost basis. The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $2.5 million and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

At the end of each reporting period, we assess whether losses should be accrued on long-term manufacturing purchase commitments in accordance with ASC Topic 330, 
Inventory
, which requires that losses that are expected to arise from firm, noncancelable and unhedged commitments for the future purchase of inventory, measured in the same way as inventory losses, should be recognized in the current period in the consolidated statements of operations unless they are deemed recoverable through firm sales contracts or when there are other circumstances that reasonably assure continuing sales without price decline. As of the end of each reporting period presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not identify any potential losses arising from remaining future purchase commitments as compared to estimated future customer sales through the remainder of the term of the manufacturing purchase commitment and, as a result, did not recognize in a current period any loss provision for future-period remaining purchase commitments.

78

Business Combinations and Fair Value Estimates

In determining whether an acquisition should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition, we first determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this is the case, the single identifiable asset or the group of similar assets is not deemed to be a business and the acquisition is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If this is not the case, we then further evaluate whether the acquisition includes, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. If so, we conclude that the acquisition is a business and account for it as a business combination.

Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination is judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Fair value and useful life determinations are based on, among other things, valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Actual results may vary from these estimates and may result in adjustments to goodwill and acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities during a measurement period or upon a final determination of asset and liability fair values, whichever comes first. Adjustments to fair values of assets and liabilities made after the end of the measurement period are recorded within operating results.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitati
ve Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through variable rate debt instruments and denominate our transactions in a variety of foreign currencies. Changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flow and earnings. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Our foreign currency transaction exposure results primarily from intercompany transactions and transactions with customers or vendors denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity in which the transaction is recorded by us. Assets and liabilities arising from such transactions are translated into the legal entity’s functional currency using the period-end exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) are included in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income (expense). We recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Foreign currency translation exposure results from the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting purposes. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rates, and income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect during each period. The effects of these foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders’ equity on our consolidated balance sheets. We recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, 3% of our revenue and 2% of our operating costs and expenses were generated by subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar and therefore are subject to foreign currency exposure.

Currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is that with respect to the Euro. We believe that a 10% change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Euro would not materially impact our operating results or financial position. We have experienced and we will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of revaluing our assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity that recorded the asset or liability. At this time, we do not hedge our foreign currency risk.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash of $336.7 million, including cash held in savings accounts. Interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates; however, due to the nature of our savings accounts, an immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash balance.

79

In July 2022, we entered into our CIBC Credit Agreement with CIBC. Borrowings under the CIBC Credit Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to either, at our option, (i) the secured overnight financing rate for an interest period selected by us, subject to a minimum of 1.5%, plus 2.0% or (ii) 1.0% plus the higher of a) the prime rate, subject to a minimum of 4.0% or b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate, plus 0.5%. As of December 31, 2024 borrowings outstanding under the CIBC Credit Agreement totaled $60.0 million and the interest rate applicable to such borrowings was 6.4%. An immediate 10% change in the Federal Funds Effective Rate would not have a material impact on our debt-related obligations, financial position or results of operations.

In May 2023, we issued the Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $460.0 million. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties. The capped calls are expected generally to offset the potential dilution to our common stock as a result of any conversion of the Notes. The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 1.50%. Accordingly, we do not have interest rate exposure on the Notes.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TransMedics Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO because a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date as the Company did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that inventory movements are appropriately recorded in the interim financial statements.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness referred to above is described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered this material weakness in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management’s report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that

82

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded $441.5 million in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company generates product revenue, from sales of its single-use, organ-specific disposable sets (i.e., its organ-specific OCS Perfusion Sets sold together with its organ-specific OCS Solutions) used on its organ-specific OCS Consoles, each being a component of the Company’s Organ Care System (OCS) products, and service revenue, by providing outsourced organ procurement, OCS perfusion management and transplant logistics services under the Company’s National OCS Program. Substantially all of the Company’s customer contracts have multiple-performance obligations. Deliverables consist of OCS Perfusion Sets and OCS Solutions. In some of those customer contracts, the deliverables also include an OCS Console, whether sold or loaned to the customer. Management evaluates each promise within a multiple-performance obligation arrangement to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation. Management has concluded that training, OCS Console equipment set-up, and the OCS Console itself are highly interdependent and represent a single, combined performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when control of the OCS product or products is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the product or products. Control is transferred for the OCS products typically only after the product has arrived at the customer site and, in addition for OCS Consoles, the training and equipment set-up have been completed by the Company. Additionally, under the National OCS program, service deliverables available to customers include organ procurement, OCS perfusion management, and transplant logistics services which are distinct performance obligations and are recognized as service revenue when the services occur.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition is a critical audit matter are the high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence related to management’s determination of the point in time when control of the OCS product or products is transferred to the customer or services are performed and revenue is recognized.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the existence and point in time when control is transferred to the customer. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating, for a sample of transactions, the existence of transactions recognized as revenue, as well as evaluating the appropriate timing of revenue recognition by obtaining and inspecting customer purchase orders and, where applicable, invoices, customer agreements, shipping documents, completion of services documents and cash receipts from customers.

TRANSMEDICS GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.
Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation 
TransMedics Group, Inc. (“TransMedics Group” and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”) was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in October 2018. TransMedics, Inc. (“TransMedics”), an operating company and wholly owned subsidiary of TransMedics Group, was incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 1998. The Company is a medical technology company transforming organ transplant therapy for end-stage organ failure patients across multiple disease states. The Company developed the Organ Care System (“OCS”) to replace a decades-old standard of care. The OCS represents a paradigm shift that transforms organ preservation for transplantation from a static state to a dynamic environment that enables new capabilities, including organ optimization and assessment. The Company’s OCS technology replicates many aspects of the organ’s natural living and functioning environment outside of the human body. The Company also developed its National OCS Program (“NOP”), an innovative turnkey solution to provide outsourced organ procurement, OCS perfusion management and transplant logistics services, to provide transplant programs in the United States with a more efficient process to procure donor organs with the OCS. The Company's logistics services include aviation transportation, ground transportation and other coordination activity.
On August 16, 2023, the Company acquired Summit Aviation, Inc. and Northside Property Group, LLC (together “Summit”). Summit was a charter flight operator based in Bozeman, Montana. The acquisition enabled TransMedics to add aviation transportation services to its NOP and become a comprehensive national provider of donor organ procurement and delivery in the United States.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of continuity of operations, realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. Prior to 2024, the Company had incurred recurring annual losses since inception. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 
$
468.2
 million. The Company generated net income of 
$
35.5
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company believes that its existing cash of 
$
336.7
 million as of December 31, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operations, capital expenditures, and debt service payments for at least the next 12 months following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If the Company needs to seek additional funding through equity financings, debt financings or strategic alliances, the Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company’s shareholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding when needed, the Company will be required to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs, product expansion or commercialization efforts, or the Company may be unable to continue operations.
The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to companies in the medical device industry and of similar size, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations, uncertainty of market acceptance of products, and the need to obtain additional financing to fund operations. Products currently under development will require additional research and development efforts, including additional clinical testing and regulatory approval, prior to commercialization. These efforts require additional capital, adequate personnel, infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. The Company’s research and development may not be successfully completed, adequate protection for the Company’s technology may not be obtained, the Company may not obtain necessary government regulatory approval on its expected timeline or at all, and approved products may not prove commercially viable. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and competition.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

89

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, the valuation of inventory, the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including acquired intangible assets and the resulting goodwill, and the valuation of stock-based awards. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, known trends and other market-specific or other relevant factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates as there are changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. As of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements, the Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require the Company to update estimates, judgments or revise the carrying value of any assets or liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions.

Risk of Concentrations of Credit, Significant Customers and Significant Suppliers

Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. The Company does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company had 
no
 allowance for credit losses. 
Significant customers are those that accounted for 
10
% or more of the Company’s revenue or accounts receivable. For the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, no customer accounted for more than 
10
% of revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2022, one customer accounted for 
14
% of revenue. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, no customer accounted for more than 
10
% of accounts receivable.

Certain of the components and subassemblies included in the Company’s products are obtained from a sole source, a single source or a limited group of suppliers, as are sterilization services. Although the Company seeks to reduce dependence on those limited sources of suppliers, manufacturers and service providers, the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, financial condition and cash flows and damage its customer relationships.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs related to a recognized debt liability are recorded as a reduction of the carrying amount of the debt liability and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the repayment term of the debt.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company maintained 
two
 letters of credit totaling $
0.5
 million for the benefit of the landlord of its leased property. The Company was required to maintain a separate cash balance of $
0.5
 million to secure the letters of credit. Related to this separate cash balance, the Company classified $
0.5
 million as restricted cash (non-current) on its consolidated balance sheets as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows includes $
0.5
 million of restricted cash in each of the years presented.
Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for credit losses, which is an estimate of amounts that may not be collectible. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and monitors economic conditions to identify facts and circumstances that may indicate its receivables are at risk of collection. The Company provides reserves against accounts receivable for estimated credit losses, if any, that may result from a customer’s inability to pay based on the composition of its accounts receivable, current economic conditions and historical credit loss activity. Amounts deemed uncollectible are charged or

90

written-off against the reserve. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company had 
no
 allowance for credit losses. During the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023
 and 2022, the Company did 
no
t record any provisions for credit losses and has written off only insignificant balances.

Inventory

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on-hand for excess and obsolete inventory and, when circumstances indicate, records charges to write down inventories to their estimated net realizable value, after evaluating historical sales, future demand, market conditions and expected product life cycles. Such charges are classified as cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Any write-down of inventory to net realizable value creates a new cost basis.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company assesses whether losses should be accrued on long-term manufacturing purchase commitments in accordance with ASC Topic 330,
 Inventory
, which requires that losses that are expected to arise from firm, noncancelable and unhedged commitments for the future purchase of inventory, measured in the same way as inventory losses, should be recognized in the current period in the consolidated statements of operations unless they are deemed recoverable through firm sales contracts or when there are other circumstances that reasonably assure continuing sales without price decline. As of the end of each reporting period presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company did not identify any potential losses arising from remaining future purchase commitments as compared to estimated future customer sales through the remainder of the term of the manufacturing purchase commitment and, as a result, did 
no
t recognize any loss provision for future-period remaining purchase commitments for the year ended 
December 31, 2024
.

Spare Parts Inventory
Spare parts are used in aviation operations and are generally not for sale. Spare parts inventory is comprised of repairable and expendable spare aircraft parts, which are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the specific identification method. Storage costs and miscellaneous materials and supplies costs related to inventory or to support flight equipment are expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2024, spare parts inventory of $
4.0
 million is included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company had 
no
 spare parts inventory as of December 31, 2023. The Company determines, based on the evidence that exists, whether or not it is appropriate to maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete spare parts inventory. The reserve is based on historical experience related to the disposal of inventory due to damage, physical deterioration, obsolescence, or other causes. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no allowance for spare parts excess and obsolescence.

Business Combinations

 In determining whether an acquisition should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition, the Company first determines whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this is the case, the single identifiable asset or the group of similar assets is not deemed to be a business and the acquisition is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If this is not the case, the Company then further evaluates whether the acquisition includes, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. If so, the Company concludes that the acquisition is a business and accounts for it as a business combination.

The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. In accordance with this method, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration paid is assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Fair value and useful life determinations are based on, among other things, valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Actual results may vary from these estimates and may result in adjustments to goodwill and acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities during a measurement period or upon a final determination of asset and liability fair values, whichever comes first. Adjustments to fair values of assets and liabilities made after the end of the measurement period are recorded within operating results.

Transaction costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

91

Asset Acquisitions

The Company measures and recognizes asset acquisitions that are not deemed to be business combinations based on the cost to acquire the asset or group of assets, which includes transaction costs. Goodwill is not recognized in asset acquisitions. In an asset acquisition, the cost allocated to acquire in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date.
On 
August 2, 2023
, the Company acquired certain assets related to lung and heart perfusion technology from Bridge to Life Ltd. and its subsidiary Tevosol, Inc., together (“BTL”). The Company intends to further develop these technologies to expand its product offerings and indications for organ transplantation. The Company accounted for the purchase of BTL as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired were concentrated on a single set of identifiable activities consisting of lung and heart perfusion technology, referred to as the in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) asset. Due to the stage of development of the IPR&D asset at the date of acquisition, it was not yet probable that there was future economic benefit from this asset. Absent successful clinical results and regulatory approval for the asset applications, there was no alternative future use associated with the asset. Accordingly, the value of the IPR&D asset of $
27.2
 million was expensed as research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2023 in the consolidated statements of operations.

Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
The Company records goodwill when consideration paid in a business combination exceeds the value of the net assets acquired. The Company’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review, such as significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets.
The Company has determined that there is a single reporting unit for the purpose of conducting this goodwill impairment assessment. The Company has the option of performing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be required. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires management to estimate and compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets, goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss up to the amount of goodwill.
Intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and are reported net of accumulated amortization. The Company amortizes acquired intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of consumption of the economic benefits or, if that pattern cannot be readily determined, on a straight-line basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset as follows:

Estimated Useful Life

Transplant aircraft

10
 years

Flight school aircraft

5
 years

OCS Consoles

5
 years

Manufacturing equipment

5
 years

Computer equipment and software

3
 years

Laboratory equipment

3
 years

Office, trade show and training equipment

5
 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of term of lease or the useful life of the improvement

92

Depreciation and amortization expense of aircraft is recognized over the estimated useful lives of each asset to their salvage value. Salvage values estimated for transplant and flight school aircraft are approximately 
50
% of the original purchase price.

Costs incurred for OCS Consoles are recorded as inventory unless and until the Company determines that an OCS Console will either be used for the NOP or loaned to a customer for its use, at which time the Company reclassifies the cost of the OCS Console from inventory to property, plant and equipment and begins to depreciate the OCS Console over its estimated useful life. Such depreciation expense is classified as a cost of revenue. The Company retains title to all OCS Consoles loaned to customers.

Costs for capital assets not yet placed into service are capitalized as construction-in-progress and depreciated once placed into service. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income (loss) from operations. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets with finite lives. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset group for recoverability, the Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset group to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized in income (loss) from operations when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset group are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset group over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows. The Company did 
no
t record any impairment losses on long-lived assets during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
.
Software Development Costs

The Company incurs costs to develop computer software that is embedded in the hardware components of the Company’s OCS Console and OCS Perfusion Sets. Research and development costs related to this software are expensed as incurred, except for costs of internally developed or externally purchased software that qualify for capitalization. Software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility, but prior to the general release of the product, are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life. Due to the short time period between achieving technological feasibility and product release and the insignificant amount of costs incurred during such periods, the Company did 
no
t capitalize any software development costs during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

The Company also capitalizes development costs related to internal-use software when it is probable that the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Costs incurred in the preliminary and post-implementation stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use and depreciated over their estimated useful life. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing performed to ensure the product is ready for its intended use. The Company capitalized costs associated with the development of internal-use software during the year ended December 31, 2024 (see Note 5).	
Leases
The Company accounts for leases under ASC Topic 842, 
Leases
 (“ASC 842”). In accordance with ASC 842, the Company accounts for a contract as a lease when it has the right to control the asset for a period of time while obtaining substantially all of the asset’s economic benefits. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains an embedded lease at inception. For arrangements that meet the definition of a lease, the Company determines the initial classification and measurement of its right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date and thereafter if modified. The lease term includes any renewal options that the Company is reasonably assured to exercise. The present value of lease payments is determined by using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determinable; otherwise, the Company uses its estimated secured incremental borrowing rate for that lease term. The Company’s policy is to not record leases with an original term of twelve months or less on its consolidated balance sheets and recognize those lease payments in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

93

In addition to rent, the leases may require the Company to pay additional costs, such as utilities, maintenance and other operating costs, which are generally referred to as non-lease components. The Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components. Only the fixed costs for lease components and their associated non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component and recognized as part of a right-of-use asset and lease liability. Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the reasonably assured lease term based on the total lease payments and is included in operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Revenue from leasing arrangements is not subject to the revenue standard for contracts with customers and remains separately accounted for under ASC 842. In accordance with ASC 842, lessors should classify and account for a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or a rate as an operating lease if the lease would have been classified as a sales-type lease or a direct financing lease and the lessor would have otherwise recognized a day-one loss. The Company’s OCS Console implied rental agreements qualify as sales-type leases with certain variable payments that meet specified criteria such that a day-one loss would be recognized under ASC 842. Therefore, in accordance with ASC 842, such leases are accounted for as operating leases and the Company does not derecognize the leased asset (the OCS Console) at the time of the sale but depreciates the leased asset over the useful life of the asset.
Fair Value Measurements

Certain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:

•
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
•
Level 2—Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices), such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
•
Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques. 
The carrying values of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt approximates its fair value (a level 2 measurement) at each balance sheet date due to its variable interest rate, which approximates a market interest rate. The Company's 
1.50
% convertible senior notes, due 2028 (the "Notes") are carried at the face value less unamortized debt discount and issuance costs on the consolidated balance sheets, and the fair value of the convertible senior notes is presented at each reporting period for disclosure purposes only (see Note 8).

Segment Information

The Company manages its operations as a 
single
 segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company has developed and commercialized a proprietary system to preserve and deliver human organs for transplant in a near-physiologic condition to address the limitations of cold storage organ preservation.

Product Warranties

The Company provides a 
one-year
 warranty on its OCS Consoles and disposable sets and replaces or repairs any OCS Console or disposable set that does not function in accordance with the product specifications
. OCS Consoles returned to the Company may be refurbished and redeployed. Estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of shipment of the OCS Console or disposable set. Warranty costs are estimated based on the current expected product replacement or repair cost and expected replacement or repair rates based on historical experience. The Company evaluates its warranty accrual at the end of each reporting period and makes adjustments as necessary. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the warranty accrual was less than $
0.1
 million.

Revenue Recognition

The Company generates net product revenue primarily from sales of its single-use, organ-specific disposable sets used on its organ-specific OCS Consoles. To a lesser extent, the Company also generates product revenue from the sale of OCS Consoles to customers and the implied rental of OCS Consoles loaned to customers at no charge. For each new transplant procedure, these customers purchase an additional OCS disposable set for use on their existing organ-specific OCS Console. The Company also generates service revenue by providing outsourced organ procurement, OCS perfusion management and transplant logistics services under its NOP in the United States.
The Company recognizes revenue from sales to customers applying the following five steps: (1) identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.

Substantially all of the Company’s customer contracts have multiple-performance obligations that contain deliverables consisting of OCS Perfusion Sets and OCS Solutions. Customer contract deliverables may also include organ procurement, OCS perfusion management and transplant logistics services under the Company's NOP or OCS Console, whether sold or loaned to the customer. The Company evaluates each promise within a multiple-performance obligation arrangement to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation. The primary performance obligations in the Company’s customer arrangements from which it derives revenue are the OCS Perfusion Sets, the OCS Solutions, the OCS Console, organ procurement, OCS perfusion management and transplant logistics services.

When a customer order includes an OCS Console, the Company has determined that customer training and the equipment set-up of the OCS Console, each performed by the Company, are not distinct because they are not sold on a standalone basis and can only be performed by the Company in conjunction with a sale or loan of its OCS Console. In addition, the Company has determined that the OCS Console itself is not distinct because the customer cannot benefit from the OCS Console without the training and equipment set-up having been completed. As a result, when the order includes an OCS Console, the Company has concluded that training, OCS Console equipment set-up, and the OCS Console itself are highly interdependent and represent a single, combined performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue from the single, combined performance obligation only once the OCS Console has arrived at the customer site and the training and equipment set-up have been completed by the Company.

Customer orders may include the loan of an OCS Console as well as OCS disposable sets used in each transplant procedure. When the Company loans the OCS Console to the customer, it retains title to the console at all times and does not require minimum purchase commitments from the customer related to any OCS products. In such cases, the Company invoices the customer for OCS disposable sets based on customer orders received for each new transplant procedure and the prices set forth in the customer agreement. Over time, the Company typically recovers the cost of the loaned OCS Console through the customer’s continued purchasing and use of additional OCS disposable sets. For these reasons, the Company has determined that part of the arrangement consideration for the disposable set is an implied rental payment for use of the OCS Console. Therefore, the Company allocates the arrangement consideration between the lease deliverables (i.e., the OCS Console) and non-lease deliverables (i.e., the OCS disposable sets) based on the relative estimated standalone selling price of each distinct performance obligation. To date, the amounts allocated to lease deliverables have been insignificant.

Revenue from sales to customers of OCS Perfusion Sets, OCS Solutions and OCS Consoles is classified as net product revenue in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Revenue from sales to customers of organ procurement, OCS perfusion management and transplant logistics services is classified as service revenue in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Revenue is recognized when control is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the product or services. When a customer order includes disposable sets and organ procurement, OCS perfusion management or transplant logistics services, the Company has determined that the disposable sets and services constitute separate performance obligations and recognizes revenue as the disposable sets and services are each delivered to the customer.

Payments Made to Customers

Under some of the Company’s customer clinical trial agreements, the Company makes payments to its customers for reimbursements of clinical trial materials and for specified clinical documentation related to the customer’s use of its OCS products. The Company also makes payments to customers involved in post-approval studies for information related to the transplant procedures performed. The Company determines the appropriate accounting treatments for these payments depending on the nature of the payment and whether they are for distinct goods or services.

95

Contract Assets and Liabilities

The Company recognizes a receivable at the point in time at which it has an unconditional right to payment. Such receivables are not contract assets. Contract assets arise from unbilled amounts in customer arrangements when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer and the Company’s right to payment is not just subject to the passage of time. The Company had 
no
 contract assets as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Contract liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which it has received consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer. The Company has determined that its only contract liabilities are deferred revenue, which consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not been recognized as revenue.

Remaining Performance Obligations
The Company generally satisfies performance obligations within 
one year
 of the contract inception date, which amounts are included in deferred revenue and are not material.
Other Revenue Considerations
The Company only includes estimated variable amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company does not assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are deemed immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer. Additionally, the Company does not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer will be one year or less. Revenue is reported net of taxes.
Distributors

The Company markets and sells its products to end customers globally. A small portion of the Company’s revenue is generated by sales to a limited number of distributors in Europe and Asia-Pacific. When the Company transacts with a distributor, its contractual arrangement is with the distributor and not with the end customer. Whether the Company transacts business with and receives the order from a distributor or directly from an end customer, its revenue recognition policy and resulting pattern of revenue recognition for the order are the same.

Research, Development and Clinical Trials Costs

Research, development and clinical trials expenses consist of costs incurred for research activities, product development, hardware and software engineering and clinical trial activities, including salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation, employee benefits, facilities costs, laboratory supplies, depreciation, testing, regulatory, data management and consulting costs.

Research, development and clinical trials costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research, development and clinical trials activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Such prepaid expenses are recognized as an expense when the related goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed, or when it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered.

Patent Costs

All patent-related costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications are expensed as incurred due to the uncertainty about the recovery of the expenditure. Amounts incurred are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses.

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of each of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the local country. Assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the period-end exchange rates, and income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect during each period. The effects of these foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

96

The Company also incurs transaction gains and losses resulting from intercompany transactions as well as transactions with customers or vendors denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity in which the transaction is recorded. Realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains (losses) are included in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of other income (expense) and totaled 
$(
0.7
)
 million, $
0.3
 million and $(
1.3
) million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based awards granted to employees, non-employees and directors based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. The fair value of option awards is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of restricted common stock awards is measured based on the difference between market value of the Company’s common stock on date of grant and the purchase price (if any). The Company measures compensation expense for restricted common stock units based on the fair value on the date of grant using the market value of the Company’s common stock. Generally, the Company issues awards with only service-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense for those awards is recognized over the vesting period of the respective award using the straight-line method. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur and records compensation cost assuming all option holders will complete the requisite service period. When the unvested portion of an award is forfeited, the Company reverses compensation expense previously recognized in the period of the forfeiture.
The Company classifies stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient’s payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified.

Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. The Company’s only elements of other comprehensive income (loss) are foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities. As of December 31, 2024, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets consists only of foreign currency translation adjustments.

Net Income (Loss) per Share

Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards, using the treasury stock method, and outstanding convertible notes, using the if-converted method. For periods in which the Company reports a net loss, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share, since dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or in the Company's tax returns. Deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be realized and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by analyzing carryback capacity in periods with taxable income, reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and estimating the future taxable profits expected and considering prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.

97

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The amount of benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

3.
Acquisition of Summit 
On 
August 16, 2023
, the Company acquired Summit pursuant to the terms of an equity purchase agreement. Summit was a charter flight operator based in Bozeman, Montana. The acquisition enabled TransMedics to add aviation transportation services to its NOP and become a comprehensive national provider of donor organ procurement and delivery in the United States.

The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a business under ASC Topic 805, 
Business Combinations
. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities were recorded as of the acquisition date, at their respective fair values. The preliminary purchase consideration of $
14.9
 million reflected an upfront cash payment of $
18.0
 million, net of cash acquired and working capital adjustments. In 2024, the Company recorded a final working capital adjustment of $
0.4
 million to the purchase price and goodwill. The Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 reflect the final allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities assumed based on fair value as of the date of the acquisition.

Property, plant and equipment consisted primarily of flight school aircraft and construction-in-progress related to a commercial aircraft hangar that Summit was in the process of constructing at the date of acquisition. Flight school aircraft were valued using market comparisons adjusted for aircraft-specific condition. The fair value of construction-in-progress approximated its cost.
Intangible assets consisted primarily of a customer relationship asset of $
2.3
 million related to flight school revenue and was valued using the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach. Significant assumptions and estimates utilized in this model include the revenue growth rate, contract renewal probability and the discount rate. Intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis to selling, general and administrative over their estimated useful lives of 
12
 years as of the acquisition date.
Goodwill was recognized for the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the workforce of the acquired business (which is not eligible for separate recognition as an identifiable intangible asset) and anticipated synergies between Summit’s existing business processes and the NOP. Goodwill from the acquisition is included within the Company’s one reporting unit and is included in the Company’s enterprise-level annual review for impairment. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition is 
no
t deductible for tax purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities relate to the differences between the fair value recognized in purchase accounting and the tax basis of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The net deferred tax liability is a source of income to support the recognition of a portion of existing deferred tax assets. Therefore, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $
1.7
 million in 2023 for the release of a portion of its valuation allowance related to the net deferred tax liabilities recorded in purchase accounting.

$
19.6
 million, $
8.1
 million and $
3.5
 million, respectively. Construction-in-progress as of 
December 31, 2024 primarily relates to capitalized internal-use software that has not yet been placed in service. Construction-in-progress as of December 31, 2023 primarily related to construction of a commercial aircraft hangar at Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport in Bozeman, Montana. The aircraft hangar was placed in service in June 2024 and is included in leasehold improvements as of December 31, 2024. The Company capitalized costs associated with the development of internal-use software of 
$
4.4
 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, included in construction-in-progress. The Company did 
no
t have capitalized costs for internal-use software in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Substantially all of the Company's property, plant and equipment are held in the United States.

6.      Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The carrying amount of goodwill was 
$
11.5
 million and $
12.0
 million as of 
December 31, 2024
 and 2023, respectively, and related to the Company’s acquisition of Summit. The decrease in goodwill from the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to final working capital adjustments to the purchase price of Summit. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. To date, the Company has had 
no
 impairments to goodwill.

As of December 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Notes was 
$
473.3
 million. The fair value was determined based on the quoted price of the last trade of the Notes prior to the end of the reporting period in an inactive market, which is considered as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
On May 11, 2023, the Company issued $
460.0
 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, pursuant to an indenture dated May 11, 2023, by and between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (the “Indenture”).

The initial conversion price of the Notes is approximately $
94.00
 per share of common stock, which represents a premium of approximately 
32.5
% over the closing price of the Company’s common stock on May 8, 2023. The Notes will mature on 
June 1, 2028
, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The Company used $
52.1
 million of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes to fund the cost of entering into capped call transactions, described below. The proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately $
393.3
 million, net of capped call transaction costs of $
52.1
 million and initial purchaser discounts and other debt issuance costs totaling $
14.6
 million.

101

The Notes bear interest at a rate of 
1.50
% per year and interest is payable 
semiannually
 in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year.
 The initial conversion rate is 
10.6388
 shares of common stock per $
1,000
 principal amount of the Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $
94.00
 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events as described in the Indenture.
Before 
March 1, 2028
, noteholders have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events, including certain corporate events, and during the 
five
 business days immediately after any 
ten
 consecutive trading days in which the trading price per $
1,000
 principal amount of Notes is less than ninety-eight percent (
98
%) of the as converted value. Additionally, the noteholder can convert their Notes during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter), commencing after the calendar quarter ending on 
September 30, 2023
 but before 
March 1, 2028
, provided the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 
20
 trading days is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of a calendar quarter. From and after March 1, 2028, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company has the right to elect to settle conversions either in cash, shares or in a combination of cash and shares of its common stock.
Prior to June 8, 2026, the Notes will not be redeemable. On or after June 8, 2026, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes (subject to the partial redemption limitation set forth in the Indenture), at its option, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.

A conditional conversion feature of the Notes was triggered on June 30, 2024 and again on September 30, 2024, as the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock was greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price of the Notes for at least 
20
 trading days during the period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on and including the last trading day of each of the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, respectively, and the Notes therefore became convertible at the noteholders’ election in the immediately following calendar quarters ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2024, respectively. If this condition or another conversion condition is met in the future, the Notes may again become convertible, otherwise the Notes will be convertible at the noteholders’ election from March 1, 2028 through the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date.
The Company accounts for the Notes as a single liability in accordance with ASC Topic 470-20 as the Company concluded that embedded conversion features within the Notes do not meet the requirements for bifurcation. Initial purchaser discounts and other debt issuance costs related to the Notes totaling $
14.6
 million were recorded by the Company as a debt discount. The debt discount is reflected as a reduction of the carrying value of the Notes on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and is being accreted to interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest method. During the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized 
$
9.7
 million and 
$
6.2
 million, respectively, in interest expense related to the 
1.50
% cash coupon of the Notes and amortization of the debt issuance costs. During the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the effective interest rate on the outstanding Notes was approximately 
2.1
%
.
Capped Call Transactions
In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Calls”) with certain financial institution counterparties (the “Option Counterparties”). The Capped Calls are generally intended to reduce or offset the potential dilution to the common stock upon any conversion of the Notes with such reduction or offset, as the case may be, subject to a cap based on the cap price. For accounting purposes, the Capped Calls are separate transactions, and not part of the terms of the Notes. The Capped Calls are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of $
52.1
 million incurred to purchase the Capped Calls was recorded as a reduction to common stock on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Each of the Capped Calls has an initial strike price of approximately $
94.00
 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes. The Capped Calls have an initial cap price of $
141.88
 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 
4,893,848
 shares of the Company’s common stock, which is the same number of shares of the Company’s common stock initially underlying the Notes. The Capped Calls are subject to automatic exercise over a 
40
 trading day period commencing on 
April 3, 2028
, subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances.

In July 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”), as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of May 8, 2023, by and among the Company and CIBC (the “First Amendment”), the Second Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of June 23, 2023, by and among the Company, and CIBC (the “Second Amendment”), the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of November 9, 2023, by and among the Company, and CIBC (the “Third Amendment”) (as amended, the “CIBC Credit Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company borrowed $
60.0
 million. In connection with the CIBC Credit Agreement, the Company repaid all amounts due under its previously outstanding credit agreement and recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $
0.6
 million during 2022, which amount was classified as other expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

On May 8, 2023, the Company entered into the First Amendment, which among other items, allowed for the issuance of the Notes and capped call transactions. On June 23, 2023, the Company entered into the Second Amendment, which among other items, permits the Company to make acquisitions of equity or assets of another entity, subject to the conditions under the Second Amendment, including acquisitions, without further consent of CIBC, up to a maximum amount of $
50.0
 million for the cash payable in connection with an individual acquisition and a maximum amount in aggregate of $
150.0
 million for the total cash consideration payable for all acquisitions made by the Company on or after June 23, 2023. The definition of consolidated adjusted EBITDA was also amended by the Second Amendment to add a provision for the pro forma effect of any acquisitions that occur during the period. Additionally, pursuant to the Second Amendment, the parties agreed to extend the start of the principal repayment period to July 31, 2026, on which date the Company is obligated to begin repayment of the term loans in equal monthly installments until the maturity date in July 2027. On November 9, 2023, the Company entered into the Third Amendment, which, among other items, permits the Company to make acquisitions of equity or assets of another entity, subject to the conditions under the Third Amendment, without further consent of CIBC, for cash consideration in a maximum aggregate amount of $
300.0
 million for all such acquisitions made by the Company on or after November 9, 2023.
Borrowings under the CIBC Credit Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to either, at the Company’s option, (i) the secured overnight financing rate for an interest period selected by the Company, subject to a minimum of 
1.50
%, plus 
2.0
% or (ii) 
1.0
% plus the higher of a) the prime rate subject to a minimum of 
4.0
% or b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate, plus 
0.5
%. At the Company’s option, the Company may prepay borrowings outstanding under the CIBC Credit Agreement, without a prepayment fee.
In connection with entering into the CIBC Credit Agreement, the Company paid upfront fees and other costs of $
1.5
 million, which were recorded by the Company as a debt discount. The debt discount is reflected as a reduction of the carrying value of long-term debt on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and is being accreted to interest expense over the term of the CIBC Credit Agreement using the effective interest method.
All obligations under the CIBC Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and each of its material subsidiaries. All obligations of the Company and each guarantor are secured by substantially all of the Company’s and each guarantor’s assets, including their intellectual property, subject to certain exceptions. Under the CIBC Credit Agreement, the Company has agreed to customary representations and warranties, events of default and certain affirmative and negative covenants to which it will remain subject until maturity. 
The financial covenants include, among other covenants, (x) a requirement to maintain a minimum liquidity amount of the greater of either (i) the consolidated adjusted EBITDA loss (or gain) for the trailing four month period (only if EBITDA is negative) and (ii) $
10.0
 million, and (y) a requirement to maintain total net revenue of at least 
75
% of the level set forth in the total revenue plan presented to CIBC
. As discussed above, the definition of consolidated adjusted EBITDA was amended to include the pro forma effect of acquisitions. The obligations under the CIBC Credit Agreement are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified events of default, including payment default, change in control, bankruptcy, insolvency, certain defaults under other material debt, certain events with respect to governmental approvals (if such events could cause a material adverse change in the Company’s business), failure to comply with certain covenants and a material adverse change in the Company’s business, operations or financial condition. As of 
December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants of the CIBC Credit Agreement.

103

During the continuance of an event of default, the interest rate per annum will be equal to the rate that would have otherwise been applicable at the time of the event of default plus 
2.0
%. If an event of default (other than certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency) occurs and is continuing, CIBC may declare all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest to be due and payable. Upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all of the outstanding principal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest will automatically become due and payable. In addition, the Company may be required to prepay outstanding borrowings, subject to certain exceptions, with portions of net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and certain casualty and condemnation events.
The Company assessed all terms and features of the CIBC Credit Agreement in order to identify any potential embedded features that would require bifurcation. As part of this analysis, the Company assessed the economic characteristics and risks of the debt. The Company determined that all features of the CIBC Credit Agreement are either clearly and closely associated with a debt host or have a de minimis fair value and, as such, do not require separate accounting as a derivative liability.
As of December 31, 2024, the stated interest rate applicable to borrowings under the CIBC Credit Agreement was 
6.4
%
. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $
4.7
 million, $
4.6
 million and $
3.7
 million, respectively, in interest expense related to the stated interest rate on outstanding borrowings and amortization of the debt issuance costs. During the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the CIBC Credit Agreement was approximately 
7.7
%
, 
7.7
% and 
6.6
%, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation 
2019 Stock Incentive Plan
The 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”) provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, unrestricted stock, unrestricted stock units, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries. The number of shares of common stock of TransMedics Group initially available for issuance under the 2019 Plan was 
3,428,571
 shares, plus the number of shares underlying awards under the previously outstanding 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”), not to exceed 
1,595,189
 shares, that expire or are terminated, surrendered, or cancelled without the delivery of shares, are forfeited to or repurchased by TransMedics Group or otherwise become available again for grant. Since the effectiveness of the Company’s 2019 Plan in April 2019, no awards have been made or will be made under the 2014 Plan.

104

Shares withheld in payment of the exercise or purchase price of an award or in satisfaction of tax withholding requirements, and the shares covered by a stock appreciation right for which any portion is settled in stock, will reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. In addition, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2019 Plan (i) will not be increased by any shares delivered under the 2019 Plan that are subsequently repurchased using proceeds directly attributable to stock option exercises and (ii) will not be reduced by any awards that are settled in cash or that expire, become unexercisable, terminate or are forfeited to or repurchased by TransMedics Group without the issuance of stock under the 2019 Plan. On May 25, 2023, the shareholders of the Company approved the Amended and Restated TransMedics Group, Inc. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Amended Plan”) to among other things, (i) increase the number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for issuance thereunder by 
1,000,000
 shares, (ii) prohibit the payment of dividend or dividend equivalents on a current basis with respect to unvested awards, (iii) extend the expiration date of the Amended Plan until June 1, 2033 and (iv) increase the annual limits on non-employee director compensation. As of 
December 31, 2024, 
897,989
 shares of common stock were available for issuance under the Amended Plan.

2021 Inducement Plan

In August 2021, the Company’s board of directors approved the TransMedics Group, Inc. Inducement Plan (the “Inducement Plan”). Pursuant to the terms of the Inducement Plan, the Company may grant nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, unrestricted stock, restricted stock unit awards and performance awards to individuals who were not previously employees or directors of the Company or individuals returning to employment after a bona fide period of non-employment with the Company. A total of 
1,000,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock were initially available for issuance under the Inducement Plan. On November 2, 2023, the Company's board of directors approved an increase of 
500,000
 to shares available under the Inducement Plan. As of 
December 31, 2024, 
536,871
 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the Inducement Plan.

Awards granted under the 2019 Plan and Inducement Plan vest over periods determined by the board of directors and expire no longer than 
ten years
 from the date of the grant. The exercise price for stock options granted is not less than the fair value of common shares based on quoted market prices.

2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Pursuant to the Company’s 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2019 ESPP”), certain employees of the Company are eligible to purchase common stock of the Company at a reduced price during offering periods. The 2019 ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock using funds contributed through payroll deductions, subject to the limitations set forth in the Internal Revenue Code, at a purchase price of 
85
% of the lower of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or the closing price on the applicable purchase date, which is the final trading day of the applicable offering period. A total of 
371,142
 shares of common stock of TransMedics Group were initially reserved for issuance under the 2019 ESPP. During the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, 
31,303
 shares were issued under the 2019 ESPP and as of December 31, 2024, 
233,256
 shares remained available for issuance under the 2019 ESPP.
Stock Option Valuation

The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Because there had been no public market for the Company's common stock prior to the Company's initial public offering, there is limited Company-specific historical and implied volatility data. Accordingly, the Company bases its estimates of expected volatility on a combination of the Company's own historical volatility and historical volatility of a group of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to itself. For options with service-based vesting conditions, the expected term of the Company’s stock options has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla” options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

The Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $
1.7
 million for the release of a portion of its valuation allowance related to the net deferred tax liabilities recorded in purchase accounting during the year ended December 31, 2023. As part of the allocation of the purchase price of Summit, the Company recorded deferred tax liabilities for the differences between the fair value recognized in purchase accounting and the tax basis of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The net deferred tax liability is a source of income to support the recognition of a portion of its existing deferred tax assets. Therefore, the Company released the same amount of its valuation allowance. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on its overall net deferred tax asset as it deems it more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of 
$
404.1
 million, which may be available to offset future taxable income, of which 
$
204.6
 million of the total net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates between 
2025
 and 
2037
, while the remaining 
$
199.5
 million do not expire but are limited in their usage to an annual deduction equal to 
80
% of annual taxable income. As of 
December 31, 2024, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of 
$
349.6
 million, which may be available to offset future taxable income and expire at various dates between 
2030
 and 
2044
. As of 
December 31, 2024, the Company also had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of 
$
13.2
 million and 
$
8.3
 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future tax liabilities and expire at various dates between 
2025
 and 
2044
. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
no
 foreign net operating loss carryforwards.

Utilization of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and corresponding provisions of state law, due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. The Company has not conducted a study to assess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since inception due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such a study. If the Company has experienced a change of control, as defined by Section 382, at any time since inception, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382, which is determined by first multiplying the value of the Company’s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards before utilization. Further, until a study is completed by the Company and any limitation is known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position.
As required by ASC 740, management of the Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of federal and state deferred tax assets and, as a result, a valuation allowance has been recorded.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company had 
no
 accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions and no amounts had been recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The Company's policy is to record any interest or penalties related to income taxes as part of the income tax provision.

109

The Company generated research credits for the tax years ending after December 31, 2001 but has not conducted a study to document qualified activities. This study may result in an adjustment to the Company's research and development carryforwards; however, until a study is completed and any adjustment is known, no amounts are being presented as an unrecognized tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2024. A full valuation allowance has been provided against the Company's research and development credits and, if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset established for the research credit carryforward and the valuation allowance.
The Company files income tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal and state jurisdictions, where applicable. There are currently no pending federal or state tax examinations. The Company has open tax years subject to examination from fiscal year 
2021
 to present. To the extent that the Company has carryforward attributes, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by federal, state or local tax authorities if they either have been or will be used in the future.
Changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2024
 related primarily to current year federal and state net operating losses generated, capitalized research and development costs, and federal and state research and development tax credits generated, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation expense. Changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2023 related primarily to current year federal and state net operating losses generated, acquired IPR&D and capitalized research and development costs. 
Changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2022 related primarily to the capitalization of research and development costs required under Section 174 and current year federal and state net operating losses generated, partially offset by a decrease in deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards due to a change in the state effective tax rate. The changes in the valuation allowance were as follows (in thousands):

Leases
The Company leases its office, laboratory and manufacturing space under 
two noncancelable leases that expire in 
December 2027
 and include a lease incentive, fixed payment escalations, and rent holidays. The leases include an option to 
renew
 for an additional 
five years
.
 The option to extend the lease term was not included in the right-of-use asset and the lease liability as it was not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company classified the leases as operating leases under ASC 842. Annual base rent increases at an average rate of 
2.5
% each year until the end of the term. The Company is also obligated to pay the landlord certain costs, taxes, and operating expenses, subject to certain exclusions. As these costs are generally variable in nature, they are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and related lease liability. In June 2023, the Company amended one of its lease agreements to add space through the remainder of the lease term and under the existing terms of the lease.

In connection with the acquisition of Summit, the Company acquired a 
20-year
 operating lease with one 
10-year

renewal
 option, for space at the Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport in Bozeman, Montana where the Company constructed a commercial aircraft hangar (see Note 3).

In June 2024, the Company entered into a lease for office and hangar space in Dallas, Texas that expires 
June 30, 2027
, subject to certain early termination provisions. Fixed monthly payments total $
1.7
 million over the 
three-year
 term of the lease. The Company is also obligated to pay the landlord certain variable costs. The Company recorded a right-of-use asset and related lease liability of $
1.5
 million in the third quarter of 2024, upon commencement of the lease.
The Company also leases office space for its NOP and hangar space for its aircraft at various locations in the United States under short-term leases.

 years and

 years, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 
6.9
%
. Because the interest rate implicit in the leases was not readily determinable, the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate was used to calculate the present value of the leases. In determining its incremental borrowing rate, the Company considered its credit quality and assessed interest rates available in the market for similar borrowings, adjusted for the impact of collateral over the term of the leases.

Commitments and Contingencies 
401(k) Savings Plan

The Company has a defined-contribution savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan covers substantially all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company instituted an employer matching program for the 401(k) plan pursuant to which the Company will match 
100
% of the first 
3
% of each participating employee’s eligible compensation contributed to the plan and 
50
% of up to an additional 
2
% each participating employee’s eligible compensation contributed to the plan. For the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded expense of 
$
3.3
 million and 
$
1.4
 million, respectively, related to these matching contributions. Prior to 2023, the Company had 
no
t made any contributions to the plan.

111

Indemnification Agreements

In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, business partners, and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements, negligence or willful misconduct, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its board of directors that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or services as directors or officers.

The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications. The Company is not currently aware of any indemnification claims and had not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Unconditional Purchase Commitment
In January 2021, the Company entered into an unconditional $
9.5
 million purchase commitment, in the ordinary course of business, for goods with specified annual minimum quantities to be purchased through 
December 2029
. The contract is not cancellable without penalty. The remaining purchase commitment as of 
December 31, 2024 was 
$
5.0
 million.
Legal Proceedings

On February 14, 2025, a class action captioned Merly Jewik v. TransMedics Group, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:25-cv-10385, was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain of its current and former officers pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, on behalf of a putative class of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company’s shares between February 28, 2023 and January 10, 2025 (the “class period”).  Plaintiff seeks to recover damages allegedly caused by purported misstatements and omissions contained in certain risk disclosures set forth in the Company’s 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports. The complaint alleges the disclosures at issue were false or misleading, because they failed to describe what plaintiff alleges were coercive business and marketing tactics, anticompetitive conduct and fraudulent billing activities on the part of the Company. The complaint claims these alleged statements and omissions operated to artificially inflate the price paid for the Company's common stock during the class period.
At each reporting date, the Company evaluates whether or not a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable under the provisions of the authoritative guidance that addresses accounting for contingencies. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the class action litigation or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses. The Company expenses as incurred the costs related to such legal proceedings.

Segment Information
The Company manages its operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions.  Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the Company’s chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group (the “CODM”), in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The CODM of the Company is the 
Chief Executive Officer
. 
The CODM assesses performance 

113

and 
allocates resources based on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and the Company’s operations are managed on a consolidated basis to decide where to allocate and invest additional resources within the business to continue growth. The CODM also utilizes the consolidated balance sheet for resource allocation and segment asset information is not provided to the CODM to allocate resources.

As a single reportable segment entity, the Company’s segment performance measure is net income (loss).

15.     Net Income (Loss) per Share
 Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards, using the treasury stock method, and outstanding convertible notes, using the if-converted method.

Item 9A. Controls 
and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding the material weakness, and based on the additional analyses and other procedures management performed, we have concluded that our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position and results of operations and cash flows as of each of the dates, and for each of the periods, presented therein in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act

as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and disposition of assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures included in such controls may deteriorate.

Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria described in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the material weakness described below.

116

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company did not design and maintain effective controls over inventory movement within its manufacturing network. Specifically, while effective controls are in place to verify the existence and accuracy of inventory as of year-end, effective controls were not designed and maintained to verify that inventory movements are appropriately recorded in the interim financial statements. The material weakness resulted in immaterial misstatements to inventory, cost of net product revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses, in the interim consolidated financial statements for the quarterly and year-to-date periods ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024. Additionally, the material weakness could result in a misstatement of the aforementioned accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Remediation Plan

We and our board of directors are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. Management, with the oversight of the audit committee of our board of directors, is in the process of assessing and finalizing its plan for remediation for the material weakness described above.  We intend to remediate this material weakness as soon as possible, and we have begun assessing our design of internal controls to remediate the aforementioned control deficiency. The Company will remediate by designing and implementing control activities to ensure the movement of inventory is timely and accurately recorded throughout the course of the year.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

December 31, 2024, certain of our directors and officers entered into a contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that is intended to satisfy the conditions specified in Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act for an affirmative defense against liability for trading in securities on the basis of material nonpublic information.
