Item 2. Properties.

Our corporate headquarters and manufacturing and clinical training facilities are located in Andover, Massachusetts, where we lease 135,199 square feet of space, including a 10,500 square foot laboratory and training facility and a 7,900 square foot ISO Class 7 cleanroom facility. The leases for these facilities expire on December 31, 2027 with an option to extend the term beyond the expiration date for one additional period of five years. In connection with our acquisition of Summit, we acquired a 20-year operating lease with one 10-year renewal option, for space at the Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport in Bozeman, Montana where we constructed a commercial aircraft hangar that we use for our flight school aircraft and office space for personnel located in Bozeman. We have a designated maintenance hub for our aircraft in Dallas, Texas under a lease that expires in 2027, subject to certain early termination provisions. We also lease office space at various locations in the United States for our NOP and hangar space for our aircraft under short-term leases.

We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our current needs, although we may seek to negotiate new leases or evaluate additional or alternate space for our operations. We believe appropriate alternative space would be readily available on commercially reasonable terms.
