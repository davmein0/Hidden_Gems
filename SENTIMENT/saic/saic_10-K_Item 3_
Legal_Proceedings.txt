Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Through closing of trading on March 4, 2024, our common stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "SAIC." Effective as of the opening of trading on March 5, 2024, we voluntarily transferred the listing of its shares of common stock to The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. Our common stock continues to be traded under the symbol “SAIC." As of March 7, 2025, there were approximately 18,000 holders of record of our common stock. The number of holders of record of our common stock may not be representative of the number of beneficial owners due to shares that may be held by depositories, brokers or nominees.
We declared and paid cash dividends on our common stock of $0.37 per share each quarterly period of fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. Total dividends declared and paid during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 were $1.48 per share. Quarterly cash dividends are typically paid in April, July, October and January, for the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. We currently intend to continue paying quarterly cash dividends in the near future, although the declaration of any future dividends and the amount thereof will be determined by our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, available cash, results of operations, and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
Stock Performance Graph
The following graph compares the total cumulative return on our common stock, from the beginning of fiscal year 2020 through fiscal year 2025, to two indices: (i) the Russell 1000 Index and (ii) the Dow Jones US Computer Services Index. The graph assumes an initial investment of $100 on January 31, 2020 and that dividends have been reinvested. The comparisons in the graph are required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), based upon historical data and are not intended to forecast or be indicative of possible future performance of our common stock.

Business Overview
We are a leading technology integrator providing full life cycle services and solutions in the technical, engineering and enterprise information technology ("IT") markets. We developed our brand by addressing our customers’ mission critical needs and solving their most complex problems for over 50 years. As one of the largest pure-play technology service providers to the U.S. government, we serve markets of significant scale and opportunity. Our primary customers are the departments and agencies of the U.S. government. We serve our customers through approximately 1,700 active contracts and task orders and employ approximately 24,000 individuals who are led by an experienced executive team of proven industry leaders. Our long history of serving the U.S. government has afforded us the ability to develop strong and longstanding relationships with some of the largest customers in the markets we serve. Substantially all of our revenues and tangible long-lived assets are generated and located in the United States.
Effective February 3, 2024, the first day of fiscal 2025, we completed a business reorganization which replaced our previous two operating sectors with five customer facing business groups supported by the enterprise organizations, including the Innovation Factory. The five business groups, which are also our operating segments, are aggregated into two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes given the similarity in economic and qualitative characteristics, and based on the nature of the customers they serve. Our two reportable segments are the Defense and Intelligence segment and the Civilian segment. 
The Defense and Intelligence segment provides a diverse portfolio of national security solutions to the DoD and Intelligence Community of the United States Government. 
The Civilian segment provides solutions to the civilian markets, encompassing federal, state, and local governments, in order to deliver services for citizen well-being, border security, and protecting lives. This includes integrating solutions into a spectrum of public service missions that impact travel, trade, health and the economy.
The offerings of both reportable segments entail the integration of emerging technologies into mission critical operations that modernize and enable national imperatives, including IT modernization, digital engineering, artificial intelligence ("AI"), mission systems support and advisory, training and simulation, and ground vehicles support. These services include end-to-end solutions spanning the design, development, integration, deployment, management and operations, sustainment and security of the customers’ entire IT infrastructure.

SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
Our Innovation Factory supports the operating segments by developing enterprise-class solutions which are delivered to our customers as stand-alone solutions or integrated with and aligned to our product offerings through the operations of the business to meet complex customer needs and accelerate digital transformation. The Innovation Factory includes designated teams focused on AI, application development, network services, platforms and cloud, engineering, and cybersecurity. It uses a highly automated, cloud-hosted tool set to rapidly build, test and deploy solutions and works with customers to enhance solutions going forward.
Costs associated with corporate functions that are not allocable to the reportable segments are presented as Corporate. See Note 16—Business Segments Information to the consolidated financial statements contained within this report for additional information. 
Within this report, we have recast historical financial information to reflect the new reportable segments. The recast historical information has no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial statements.
Economic Opportunities, Challenges, and Risks
In fiscal 2025, we generated 98% of our revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, including subcontracts on which we perform. Our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. government spending and the alignment of our offerings and capabilities with the budget priorities of the U.S. government. In March 2025, the President signed a continuing resolution ("CR") that extends government funding through the close of government fiscal year ("GFY") 2025. The measure provides budget certainty for agencies through September 30, 2025. The CR also provides flexibility for new starts on programs at the DoD, which are typically not allowed under CRs.
Under terms of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, a 1% sequestration is to be applied to all agencies operating under CRs past April 30, 2025. However, the law provides discretion on implementation of these reductions to the Office of Management and Budget ("OMB"). It is unclear where or if the OMB will choose to implement such cuts.
The Department of Government Efficiency is driving changes in the structure and priorities of Federal agencies. Reductions in personnel, changes in agency alignment, and required reviews of new contracting activity are slowing new awards. In addition, agencies are expected to conduct comprehensive reviews of existing contracting activity to identify potential efficiencies or nonalignment with new Administration priorities. SAIC contracts will be subject to these reviews.
In January 2025, the Federal debt ceiling was reached, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury is operating under "extraordinary measures" to service debt obligations of the U.S. Government. The Treasury has not yet indicated when those measures will be exhausted, but it is expected that the date of potential default will be sometime during the summer of 2025. Before that time, Congress will need to pass, and the President will need to sign, legislation that would extend or eliminate the debt limit. Failure to do so could lead to negative impacts on our business, and any agreement to raise the ceiling that significantly reduces future funding could affect our addressable market in subsequent years.
The new U.S. government administration is putting in place a number of executive orders and actions which could affect our business. Some of these actions could create delays in the timely issuance of contract awards.
Adverse changes in fiscal and economic conditions could materially impact our business. Some changes that could have an adverse impact on our business include the implementation of future spending reductions (including sequestration), delayed passage of appropriations bills resulting in temporary or full-year continuing resolutions, inflationary increases adversely impacting fixed-price contracts, and potential government shutdowns. 
Spending packages, including the infrastructure bill, Inflation Reduction Act, and CHIPS and Science Act, as well as future potential spending packages, may provide additional opportunity in areas of SAIC focus such as digital modernization, cyber, microelectronics support, and climate resiliency.
The U.S. government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a competitive bidding process (including indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity ("IDIQ"), U.S. General Services Administration ("GSA") schedules, and other multi-award contracts), which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. Additionally, the U.S. government has put renewed emphasis on increasing the number of small business prime set aside contracts that further reduce the addressable market in some areas.

Despite the budget and competitive pressures affecting the industry, we believe we are well-positioned to protect and expand existing customer relationships and benefit from opportunities that we have not previously pursued. Our scale, size, and prime contractor leadership position are expected to help differentiate us from our competitors, especially on large contract opportunities. We believe our long-term, trusted customer relationships and deep technical expertise provide us with the sophistication to handle highly complex, mission-critical contracts. Our value proposition is found in the proven ability to serve as a trusted adviser to our customers. In doing so, we leverage our expertise and scale to help them execute their mission.
We succeed as a business based on the solutions we deliver, our past performance, and our ability to compete on price. Our solutions are inspired through innovation based on adoption of best practices and technology integration of the best capabilities available. Our Innovation Factory develops superior enterprise-class solutions which are delivered to our customers as stand-alone solutions or integrated with and aligned to our product offerings to meet complex customer needs and accelerate digital transformation. Our past performance was achieved by employees dedicated to supporting our customers' most challenging missions. Our current cost structure and ongoing efforts to reduce costs by strategic sourcing and developing repeatable offerings sold "as a service" and as managed services in a more commercial business model are expected to allow us to compete effectively on price in an evolving environment. Our ability to be competitive in the future will continue to be driven by our reputation for successful program execution, competitive cost structure, development of new pricing and business models, and efficiencies in assigning the right people, at the right time, in support of our contracts.
On May 6, 2023, SAIC closed the sale of its logistics and supply chain management business ("Supply Chain Business") to ASRC Federal Holding Company, LLC ("ASRC Federal"). The sale enables us to focus its resources on long-term strategic growth areas.
On February 4, 2023, we sold 0.1% of our 50.1% majority ownership interest in Forfeiture Support Associates J.V. ("FSA") to its sole joint venture partner for a nominal amount. As a result of the sale and amendment to the joint venture operating agreement of FSA, we no longer control the joint venture and accounts for its retained interest as an equity method investment as of the date of the transaction. 
See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report for additional discussion of our industry and regulatory environment.
Management of Operating Performance and Reporting
Our business and program management process is directed by professionals focused on serving our customers by providing high quality services in achieving program requirements. These professionals carefully monitor contract margin performance by constantly evaluating contract risks and opportunities. Throughout each contract’s life cycle, program managers review performance and update contract performance estimates to reflect their understanding of the best information available.
We evaluate our results of operations by considering the drivers causing changes in revenues, operating income, adjusted operating income
(1)
, adjusted EBITDA
(1)
, and operating cash flows. Given that revenues fluctuate on our contract portfolio over time due to contract awards and completions, changes in customer requirements, and increases or decreases in ordering volume of materials, we evaluate significant trends and fluctuations resulting from these factors. Whether performed by our employees or by our subcontractors, we primarily provide services and, as a result, our cost of revenues are predominantly variable. We also analyze our cost mix (labor, subcontractor and materials) in order to understand operating margin because programs with a higher proportion of SAIC labor are generally more profitable. Changes in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues other than from revenue volume or cost mix are normally driven by fluctuations in shared or corporate costs, or cumulative revenue adjustments due to changes in estimates.
Changes in operating cash flows are described with regard to changes in cash generated through the provision of services, significant drivers of fluctuations in assets or liabilities and the impacts of changes in timing of cash receipts or disbursements.

Revenues. 
Revenues increased $35 million from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 primarily due to ramp up in volume in existing and new contracts. This was partially offset by the sale of the Supply Chain Business ($188 million) (see Note 4—Divestitures) in the prior year, and contract completions. Adjusting for the impact of the divestiture, revenues grew approximately 3.1%.
Revenues decreased $260 million from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 primarily due to the sale of the Supply Chain Business ($493 million) and the deconsolidation of FSA ($143 million), contract completions and five additional working days in fiscal 2023. This was partially offset by ramp up in volume on existing and new contracts. Adjusting for the impact of the divestiture, deconsolidation and estimated impact of the additional five working days in fiscal 2023, revenues grew approximately 7.4%.
Cost of Revenues. 
Cost of revenues increased $15 million from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 primarily due to ramp up in volume on existing and new contracts. This was partially offset by the sale of the Supply Chain Business ($172 million) in the prior year, and contract completions. Adjusting for the impact of the divestiture, cost of revenues grew approximately 2.9%.
Cost of revenues decreased $244 million from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 primarily due to the sale of the Supply Chain Business ($461 million) and the deconsolidation of FSA ($132 million), contract completions and five additional working days in fiscal 2023. This was partially offset by ramp up in volume on existing and new contracts. Adjusting for the impact of the divestiture, deconsolidation and estimated impact of the additional five working days in fiscal 2023, cost of revenues grew approximately 7.7%.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $34 million from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 primarily due to lower incentive-based compensation expense and lower stock-based compensation related to the restructuring and executive transition.
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $1 million from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 primarily due to lower indirect spend and intangible amortization and depreciation, partially offset by higher incentive-based compensation expense, including acceleration of stock-based compensation related to the reorganization and executive transition.
Operating Income. 
Operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 primarily due to a $233 million gain recognized from the sale of the Supply Chain Business and a $7 million gain recognized from the deconsolidation of FSA in the prior year. This was partially offset by improved profitability across our contract portfolio, the resolution of the Assault Amphibious Vehicle ("AAV") contract termination, lower

incentive-based compensation expense, and lower stock-based compensation related to the restructuring and executive transition.
Operating income as a percentage of revenues increased from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 primarily due to a $233 million gain recognized from the sale of the Supply Chain Business, a $7 million gain recognized from the deconsolidation of FSA, improved profitability across our contract portfolio and lower acquisition and integration costs, partially offset by higher incentive-based compensation expense, including acceleration of stock-based compensation related to the reorganization and executive transition.
Income Taxes. 
Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2025 is lower than the rate in fiscal 2024

primarily due to the gain from the divestiture of the Supply Chain Business and the associated non-deductible goodwill in the prior year.
Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2024 was higher than the rate in fiscal 2023 primarily due to the gain from the divestiture of the Supply Chain Business and the associated non-deductible goodwill, along with an increase in non-deductible compensation related to the reorganization and executive transition. These expenses are partially offset by additional deductions for foreign-derived intangible income and the expiration of an uncertain tax position. 
Beginning in fiscal 2023, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes. While the impact to income taxes payable was most significant in fiscal 2023, this impact will decrease over the five-year amortization period and is anticipated to be immaterial in year six. The actual impact will depend on the amount of research and development expenses we incur, whether Congress modifies or repeals this provision and whether new guidance and interpretive rules are released by the U.S. Treasury, among other factors.
In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) enacted model rules for a new 15% global minimum tax framework (“Pillar Two”) which became effective in certain jurisdictions beginning in fiscal 2024. We do not anticipate Pillar Two to have a significant impact on our effective tax rate or our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

This was partially offset by ramp up in volume on existing and new contracts. Adjusting for the impact of the divestiture, revenues grew 1.7%.
Revenues decreased $59 million from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 primarily due to the sale of Supply Chain Business ($493 million), contract completions and five additional working days in fiscal 2023. This was partially offset by ramp up in volume on existing and new contracts.

Adjusted operating income, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful for management and investors in evaluating our financial information, they should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations, definitions, and how we believe these measures are useful to management and investors are provided below. Other companies may define similar measures differently.
Adjusted operating income. 
Adjusted operating income is a performance measure that primarily excludes the impact of non-recurring transactions that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted operating income is calculated by taking operating income and excluding depreciation and amortization, acquisition and integration costs, impairments, restructuring costs, and any other material non-recurring costs. The acquisition and integration costs relate to our acquisitions. The restructuring and impairment costs represent the reorganization and facilities optimization costs or impairments of long-lived assets, along with associated depreciation included in those restructuring and impairment costs. The recovery of acquisition and integration costs and restructuring and impairment costs relate to costs recovered through our indirect rates in accordance with Cost Accounting Standards. Depreciation of property, plant, and equipment relates to property, plant, and equipment specifically identifiable for each segment. Adjusted operating income also excludes amortization of intangible assets because we do not have a history of significant acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the related amortization term are unique to each acquisition. We believe that these performance measures provide management and investors with useful information in assessing trends in our ongoing operating performance and may provide greater visibility in understanding the long-term financial performance of our Company. Refer to "Segment and Corporate Results" section above for the reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure to the non-GAAP financial measure.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. 
The performance measure EBITDA is calculated by taking net income and excluding interest and loss on sale of receivables, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that excludes costs that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing performance. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking EBITDA and excluding acquisition and integration costs, impairments, restructuring costs, and any other material non-recurring costs. Integration costs are costs to integrate acquired companies including costs of strategic consulting services, facility consolidation and employee related costs such as retention and severance costs. The acquisition and integration costs relate to our acquisitions. See Note 1—Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5—Restructuring and Impairment to the consolidated financial statements contained within this report for information related to our restructuring and impairment costs.
We believe that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide management and investors with useful information in assessing trends in our ongoing operating performance and may provide greater visibility in understanding the long-term financial performance of our Company.

Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues increased from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 primarily due to improved profitability across our contract portfolio, the resolution of the AAV contract termination, lower incentive-based compensation expense, and lower stock-based compensation related to the restructuring and executive transition.
Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues increased from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, primarily due to improved profitability across our contract portfolio, partially offset by higher incentive-based compensation expense, including acceleration of stock-based compensation related to the reorganization and executive transition.
Other Key Performance Measures
In addition to the financial measures described above, we believe that bookings and backlog are useful measures for management and investors to evaluate our potential future revenues. We also consider measures such as contract types and cost of revenues mix to be useful for management and investors to evaluate our operating income and performance.
Net Bookings and Backlog. 
Net bookings represent the estimated amount of revenues to be earned in the future from funded and negotiated unfunded contract awards that were received during the period, net of adjustments to estimates on previously awarded contracts. We calculate net bookings as the period’s ending backlog plus the period’s revenues less the prior period’s ending backlog and initial backlog obtained through acquisitions.
Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed. We do not include in backlog estimates of revenues to be derived from IDIQ contracts, but rather record backlog and bookings when task orders are awarded on these contracts. Given that much of our revenue is derived from IDIQ contract task orders that renew annually, bookings on these contracts tend to refresh annually as the task orders are renewed. Additionally, we do not include in backlog contract awards that are under protest until the protest is resolved in our favor.

We segregate our backlog into two categories as follows:
•
Funded Backlog.
 Funded backlog for contracts with government agencies primarily represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts. It does not include the unfunded portion of contracts in which funding is incrementally appropriated or authorized on a quarterly or annual basis by the U.S. government and other customers even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years. Funded backlog for contracts with non-government customers represents the estimated value on contracts, which may cover multiple future years, under which we are obligated to perform, less revenues previously recognized on these contracts.
•
Negotiated Unfunded Backlog.
 Negotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from negotiated contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized and from unexercised priced contract options. Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include any estimate of future potential task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ, GSA Schedules or other master agreement contract vehicles, with the exception of certain IDIQ contracts where task orders are not competitively awarded and separately priced but instead are used as a funding mechanism, and where there is a basis for estimating future revenues and funding on future anticipated task orders.
We expect to recognize revenue from a substantial portion of our funded backlog within the next twelve months. However, the U.S. government can adjust the scope of services of or cancel contracts at any time. Similarly, certain contracts with commercial customers include provisions that allow the customer to cancel prior to contract completion. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees (contract profit) for work performed.

The change in contract mix for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 reflects a decrease in firm-fixed price type contracts due to the divestiture of the Supply Chain Business which historically had a higher proportion of these contracts.
Cost of Revenues Mix. 
We generate revenues by providing a customized mix of services to our customers. The profit generated from our service contracts is affected by the proportion of cost of revenues incurred from the efforts of our employees

(which we refer to below as labor-related cost of revenues),

the efforts of our subcontractors and the cost of materials used in the performance of our service obligations under our contracts. Contracts performed with a higher proportion of SAIC labor are generally more profitable. The following tables present cost mix as a percentage of each reportable segment and total SAIC revenues for the periods presented:

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As a services provider, our business generally requires minimal infrastructure investment. We expect to fund our ongoing working capital, commitments and any other discretionary investments with cash on hand, future operating cash flows and, if needed, borrowings under our $1.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility and $300 million Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement ("MARPA Facility") (see Note 14—Sale of Receivables to the consolidated financial statements contained within this report for additional information).
We anticipate that our future cash needs will be for working capital, capital expenditures, and contractual and other commitments. We consider various financial measures when we develop and update our capital deployment strategy, which include evaluating cash provided by operating activities, free cash flow and financial leverage.
Our ability to fund these needs will depend, in part, on our ability to generate cash in the future, which depends on our future financial results. Our future results are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors that may be outside of our direct control. Although we believe that the financing arrangements in place will permit us to finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions for at least the next year, our future access to, and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions will be impacted by many factors (including our credit rating, capital market liquidity and overall economic conditions). Therefore, we cannot ensure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all. Nevertheless, we believe that our existing cash on hand, generation of future operating cash flows, and access to bank financing and capital markets will provide adequate resources to meet our short-term liquidity and long-term capital needs.
During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2025, we amended our Credit Facility. See Note 11—Debt Obligations to the consolidated financial statements contained within this report for additional information.
Borrowings under our Term Loan Facilities, our MARPA Facility, and our Revolving Credit Facility incur interest at a variable rate. In accordance with our risk management objectives, we hold fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in interest payment cash flows on a substantial portion of our outstanding variable rate debt. These instruments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Under the swap agreements, we pay the fixed rate and the counterparties to the agreement pay a floating interest rate.
Our Credit Facility contains customary terms and conditions including financial covenants and covenants restricting our ability to merge or consolidate with another entity or undertake other fundamental changes, enter into property sale and leaseback transactions, and incur liens. Our dividends and share repurchases may be limited under certain leverage ratios, and we may be required to make an annual debt prepayment based on our cash flows from operating activities. See Note 11—Debt Obligations to the consolidated financial statements contained within this report for a more complete understanding of our Credit Facility.
We currently maintain credit ratings from major U.S. rating agencies. Failure to maintain acceptable ratings could have an adverse effect on our future cost of capital and any significant increase in the level of our borrowings could negatively impact these ratings.

We did not experience any significant impact to our liquidity or access to capital, and we were not required to obtain additional financing or make significant modifications to our capital deployment strategy, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("the CARES Act") allowed for the deferral of certain payroll tax payments through December 31, 2020 and we deferred total payments of approximately $103 million. The first installment (approximately $51 million) of these deferred payroll taxes was paid during fiscal 2022 and the second and final installment was paid during fiscal 2023.
In December 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of our outstanding common stock under our existing share repurchase plan. This authorization was effective December 16, 2024 and has no expiration date. During fiscal 2025, we repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares of our common stock from the open market for approximately $527 million in connection with our share purchase plan. Since the plan's inception in December of 2013, we have repurchased approximately 24.5 million shares of our common stock from the open market for approximately $2.1 billion.

Other liabilities primarily consist of liabilities associated with deferred compensation plan obligations and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. Deferred compensation plan obligations due in fiscal 2026 are based on participants’ payment elections on retirement and estimated retirement ages. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits due in fiscal 2026 are based on the fiscal year in which the reversals of timing positions are likely to occur. This amount excludes estimated future minimum commitments related to our Defined Benefit Plans (see Note 9—Retirement Plans).
See respective notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this report for further information about our long-term debt (Note 11—Debt Obligations), lease payment obligations (Note 15—Operating Leases), liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits (Note 10—Income Taxes), and letters of credit and surety bonds (Note 17—Legal Proceedings and Other Commitments and Contingencies).

payments in fiscal 2024 from the sale of the Supply Chain Business and other changes in working capital, partially offset by higher incentive-based compensation payments in the current year.
Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $136 million from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash provided by the MARPA Facility and higher tax payments in fiscal 2024 from the sale of the Supply Chain Business, partially offset by lower incentive-based compensation payments and other changes in working capital.
Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities. 
Cash used in investing activities was $35 million in fiscal 2025 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $314 million in the prior year primarily due to the $356 million of cash proceeds from the sale of the Supply Chain Business in the prior year (see Note 4—Divestitures to the consolidated financial statements contained within this report for additional information).
Cash provided by investing activities was $314 million in fiscal 2024 compared to cash used in investing activities of $36 million in fiscal 2023 primarily due to the $356 million of cash proceeds from the sale of the Supply Chain Business in fiscal 2024.
Cash Used in Financing Activities. 
Cash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher proceeds from borrowings, net of principal payments of $399 million, partially offset by higher plan share repurchases of $170 million in the current year.
Cash used in financing activities increased from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 primarily due to higher principal payments, net of proceeds received from borrowings of $131 million and higher plan share repurchases of $112 million.
Commitments and Contingencies
We are subject to a number of reviews, investigations, claims, lawsuits and other uncertainties related to our business. For a discussion of these items, see Note 17—Legal Proceedings and Other Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained within this report.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies, as well as the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, gains and losses during the reporting periods. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions have been prepared on the basis of the most current reasonably available information and, in some cases, are our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates and assumptions may change in the future as more current information is available.
Management believes that our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are both material to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Typically, the circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and complex have to do with making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These policies are described below.
Revenue Recognition. 
We generate our revenues primarily from long-term contracts in which we provide technical, engineering and enterprise IT services directly for the U.S. government and as a subcontractor with other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government. We evaluate the nature of the contract and the services provided when determining the accounting method utilized for each contract. We recognize a significant portion of our revenues using a cost input measure of progress that requires us to rely on the skill and expertise of our engineers, program managers and business management professionals in the many areas of cost estimation. These estimates of costs can span several years and take into account many factors including the availability, productivity and cost of labor, potential delays in our performance and the level of future indirect cost allocations. 
36
Table of Contents
SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
Many of our contracts include forms of variable consideration such as reimbursable costs, award and incentive fees, usage-based pricing, service-level penalties, performance bonuses, and other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. Variable amounts are generally determined upon our achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and may be based upon customer discretion. At contract inception, we estimate the transaction price and may include variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. When developing these estimates, we consider the customer, contract terms, the complexity of the work and related risks, the extent of customer discretion, historical experience and the potential of a significant reversal of revenue.
Changes in Estimates on Contracts. 
Changes in estimates of revenues, cost of revenues or profits related to performance obligations satisfied over time are recognized in operating income in the period in which such changes are made for the inception-to-date effect of the changes. Changes in these estimates can occur routinely over the performance period for a variety of reasons, which include: changes in scope; changes in cost estimates due to unanticipated cost growth or reassessments of risks impacting costs; changes in the estimated transaction price, such as variable amounts for incentive or award fees; and performance being better or worse than previously estimated. 
A significant portion of our contracts recognize revenue using a cost input measure (cost-to-cost), which requires estimates of total costs at completion. Estimating costs at completion is complex due to the nature of the services being performed and the length of certain contracts. Contract costs generally include direct costs, such as labor, subcontract costs and materials, and indirect costs identifiable with or allocable to a specific contract. Management must make assumptions regarding the complexity of the work to be performed, the schedule and associated tasks, labor productivity and availability, increases in wages and prices of materials, execution by our subcontractors, overhead cost rates, and other variables. For contracts using a cost input measure, when total expected contract costs exceed total estimated contract revenues, we recognize the total estimated loss in the quarter identified. Total estimated losses are inclusive of any unexercised options that are probable of award, only if they increase the amount of the loss. Aggregate net changes in contract estimates increased operating income by $15 million and $4 million for fiscal 2025 and 2023, respectively. Aggregate net changes in contract estimates were immaterial in fiscal 2024. For additional information related to changes in estimates on contracts, including gross favorable and unfavorable adjustments as well as the impact to earnings per share, see Note 3—Revenues to the consolidated financial statements contained within this report.
Business Combinations. 
We record all tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess amount of the aggregated purchase consideration paid over the fair value of the net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined using either an income, cost or market approach. Each of these valuation methods requires significant judgment, including analysis of historical performance and estimates of future performance. Estimates can be affected by contract performance and other factors that may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates.
Under the income approach, fair value is based on the present value of future cash flows to be generated over the remaining economic life of an asset or liability being measured. This method includes estimates for projections of revenues and expenses, royalty rates, tax rates, contributory asset charges, discount rates, and tax amortization benefits.

Under the cost approach, fair value is measured by determining the replacement cost of an asset. Under the market approach, the fair value reflects the price and other relevant information of market transactions for comparable assets, liabilities or groups of assets and liabilities. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables.
The valuations are based on information that existed as of the acquisition date. During the measurement period that shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may adjust provisional amounts recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed to reflect new information that we have subsequently obtained regarding facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets. 
Goodwill is recorded as the difference between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for potential impairment annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. In our qualitative assessment, an evaluation is performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists based on qualitative factors. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, relevant entity-specific events, factors affecting the reporting unit, and share price.
We may additionally perform a quantitative assessment in which the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its respective carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the amount of impairment expense is equal to the difference between the reporting unit’s fair value and the reporting unit’s carrying value.
Determining the fair value of each reporting unit involves judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using either a market approach, income approach, or a combination of both. When performing a quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis, we reconcile the aggregate fair value of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the measurement date.
Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using a multi-year discounted cash flow model that involves assumptions about projected future revenue growth, operating margins, income tax rates, capital expenditures, discount rate and terminal value. The discount rate is an estimate of the cost of capital that a market participant would expect for the respective reporting unit. The terminal value represents the present value in the last year of the projection period of all subsequent cash flows into perpetuity.
Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on multiples of earnings derived from observable market data of comparable public companies. We evaluate companies within our industry that have operations with observable and comparable economic characteristics and are similar in nature, scope and size to the reporting unit being compared. We analyze historical acquisitions in our industry to estimate a control premium that we incorporate into the fair value estimate of a reporting unit under the market approach.
Determining the carrying value of each reporting unit requires judgment and involves the assignment of assets and liabilities to the reporting units based on a systematic and rational allocation methodology. Certain assets and liabilities may be specifically identified and assigned to a reporting unit based on the information contained within our financial systems; whereas, other assets and liabilities may be allocated using measurable relationships or other basis for allocation.
As a result of the internal reorganization on February 3, 2024, we reallocated goodwill to the five new goodwill reporting units. We performed a goodwill impairment test immediately before and after the reorganization, both of which resulted in no impairment. For the goodwill impairment test immediately after the reorganization, we performed a quantitative assessment of our goodwill as of February 3, 2024 for the five new goodwill reporting units. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using a 50:50 weighting of fair values derived from an income approach and market approach.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing using a qualitative assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that an impairment did not exist and that a quantitative analysis was not necessary.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the method that best reflects how their economic benefits are utilized or, if a pattern of economic benefits cannot be reliably determined, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Income Taxes.
 Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid and includes judgments related to matters for which ultimate resolution may not become known until the final resolution of an examination by taxing authorities or the statute of limitations lapses.
We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of

existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent operating results. If we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would either decrease or increase, respectively, the provision for income taxes.

Item 7A. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to certain market risks in the normal course of business. The following information about our market sensitive financial instruments contains forward-looking statements.
Foreign Currency Risk
Most of our contracts are paid in U.S. dollars and our cost to perform on these contracts are generally paid in U.S. dollars. Since the substantial majority of our business is conducted in U.S. dollars, a 10% change in any foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations.
Interest Rate Risk
Debt obligations. 
Our financial risk management objective is to reduce the negative impact to earnings from changes in interest rates, which we may manage through operational means or the use of financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps. As of January 31, 2025, we have approximately $1.8 billion of variable rate debt. The fair value of our outstanding long-term debt obligations approximates its carrying value. In connection with the issuances of our variable rate Term Loan A and Term Loan B Facilities, we entered into fixed interest rate swap agreements, effectively converting a substantial portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt in order to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. We regularly evaluate our outstanding debt and swap agreements to meet our risk management objective. A hypothetical 50 basis points ("bps") change to interest rates would have a net impact of $6 million on our results of operations or cash flows. For additional information related to our debt and interest rate swap agreements, see Note 11—Debt Obligations and Note 12—Derivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.
Derivatives. 
As of January 31, 2025, the fair value of our fixed interest rate swaps asset was $6 million. Under the swap agreements, we pay a fixed rate and the counterparties to the agreements pay a floating interest rate based on 1-month Term SOFR. A hypothetical 50 bps change in the 1-month Term SOFR curve would change the fair value of the fixed interest rate swaps up to $2 million. Since the interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, the change in fair value is reported as a component of equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss). We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. For additional information related to calculating the fair value of our interest rate swaps, see Note 12—Derivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Cash equivalents. 
A 10% unfavorable interest rate movement for interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents would not materially impact the value of our cash holdings and would have a negligible impact on interest income at current market interest rates.
Inflation Risk
For each of the most recent three fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, inflation has not had a significant impact on our revenues or costs. Approximately 62% of our revenues for fiscal 2025 were derived from cost-reimbursement type contracts, which have limited inflation risk because our contracts generally entail the provision of labor on a reimbursable basis, and, when materials are acquired, they provide for billing to the customer during the period in which the materials were received. Bids for longer-term FFP and T&M contracts typically include sufficient provisions for labor and other cost escalations to cover anticipated cost increases over the period of performance. As a result, if we were to experience significant levels of inflation, our revenues and costs for cost-type contracts 
39
Table of Contents
SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
would generally both increase commensurate with inflation and operating income as a percentage of total revenues would not be significantly affected. Operating income as a percentage of total revenues would not be significantly affected for longer-term FFP and T&M contracts to the extent that bid contract cost escalations are sufficient to cover heightened inflation levels.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer (our Chief Executive Officer) and principal financial officer (our Chief Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of January 31, 2025, and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, completely, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP; (iii) provide reasonable assurance that our receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with the authorization of our management and directors; and (iv) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.
Our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 based on the framework established in the 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our management has assessed in its evaluation the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 and has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Although our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, because of inherent limitations, our management does not expect that our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness in such assessment to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
Science Applications International Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Science Applications International Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Science Applications International Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated March 17, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We currently maintain three shareholder-approved equity compensation plans that issue stock-based awards including the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan ("2023 EIP"), the Management Stock Compensation Plan, and the Amended and Restated 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP").

This amount includes 77,924 stock options outstanding and 688,421 shares subject to other stock-based awards previously granted but not yet issued under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan ("2013 EIP"), and 722,932 shares issuable for other stock-based awards under the 2023 EIP. This amount does not include shares to be issued pursuant to purchase rights under the ESPP.
(2)
Does not include shares to be issued for stock-based awards, other than stock options, which will not require any payment upon issuance of those shares.
(3)
Includes 1,710,834 shares of our common stock available for issuance under the ESPP and 1,906,599 shares under the 2023 EIP. On June 7, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved an amended and restated ESPP which limits the total number of shares reserved for issuance to 2.0 million and extends the ESPP expiration date from September 26, 2023 to the earlier of its termination by the Board or the issuance of all shares available for issuance. On June 7, 2023, the Company's stockholders approved the 2023 EIP. The 2023 EIP authorized 2.2 million new shares of the Company's common stock to be issued as various types of stock-based compensation and cash awards. After June 7, 2023, no new awards may be issued under the 2013 EIP and any awards that subsequently expire, are forfeited or canceled, are settled in cash, or are used to cover recipient tax obligations, will become available for issuance under the 2023 Plan. Awards previously issued and outstanding under the 2013 EIP will continue to remain outstanding and be subject to the terms of the 2013 EIP. We expect that the number of shares actually issued under the 2023 EIP will be significantly less than the number of total awards outstanding under the plan because (a) a net option exercise results in a smaller portion of the number of award shares being issued when a participant uses award shares, rather than cash, to pay the exercise price, which historically most participants have elected to do, (b) most participants historically have elected to let the Company retain award shares to pay for taxes due on the exercise of options and all participants are required to use award shares to pay for taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units, (c) some participants may terminate employment with the Company before the vesting of awards resulting in awards being forfeited and (d) some participants may not exercise stock options before the expiration date for a variety of reasons, including if the exercise price exceeds the then current market price of shares.

SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
Science Applications International Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Science Applications International Corporation (the Company) as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 17, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Cost estimation for revenue recognition on certain contracts using a cost input measure of progress
Description of the Matter
The Company recognizes a portion of its revenues using a cost input measure of progress (cost-to-cost). Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, revenue is recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated costs at completion. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, recognizing revenue on long-term contracts involves significant estimates and judgments. Estimating costs at completion for certain contracts is complex due to the nature of the services being performed and the length of the contracts. Changes in estimates (as quantified in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) can routinely occur due to a variety of reasons including changes in scope, changes in cost estimates due to unanticipated cost growth or reassessments of risks impacting costs. Changes in estimates on these contracts, if significant, could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. 
Auditing the Company’s accounting for revenue for certain contracts using the cost input measure of progress was complex due to the judgment involved in estimating the total estimated costs at completion for these contracts. Management estimates total costs at completion by making assumptions regarding the complexity of the work to be performed, the schedule and associated tasks, labor productivity and availability, increases in wages and prices of materials, execution by subcontractors, overhead cost rates, and other variables.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s recognition of revenue using the cost input measure of progress. For example, we tested controls over the significant assumptions applied in determining the estimation of costs to be incurred on the contract and controls evaluating the appropriateness of changes in estimated costs to complete throughout the contract’s period of performance. We also tested internal controls that management executes to validate the data used in determining this revenue was complete and accurate.
To test the accuracy of the Company’s estimated costs at completion, our audit procedures included, among others, comparing estimates of labor costs, subcontractor costs, and materials to actual costs incurred to date, comparing estimated margins to margins on similar contracts, and agreeing the key terms to contract documentation. Our audit procedures also included, among others, evaluating the nature, timing and extent of the amounts of revenue and costs recorded to date, including any changes in estimated costs at completion from the prior period. For example, to test a change in estimate, we inspected underlying evidence for the reason for the change in estimate and the timing of such change and we recalculated the inception-to-date effect recorded. We also evaluated whether a lack of change in estimate was appropriate, where applicable, on contracts.

Certain unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would materially affect the effective income tax rate
Description of the Matter
As described in Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company files income tax returns in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertainty in income taxes when it is more likely than not that a tax position will not be sustained on examination and settlement with various taxing authorities. 
Auditing these liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate was complex due to the significant judgment in applying the relevant tax laws and inherent uncertainty involved in predicting the ultimate resolution of such matters with the taxing authority. Changes to these liabilities resulting from ongoing or future audits by the taxing authorities could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process of accounting for income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits. For example, we tested the Company’s controls over management’s review of tax positions taken by the Company to determine whether the positions met the threshold for recognition within the consolidated financial statements, as well as determination of the measurement of the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.
To test the recognition of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would materially affect the effective tax rate and measurement of these unrecognized tax benefits, we involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assess the technical merits of the Company’s material tax positions. We performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating communications with relevant taxing authorities, evaluating whether management appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement, or disclosure of these unrecognized tax benefits, and testing the assumptions used by management in estimating the valuation of any associated liabilities.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1—Business Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
Overview
Description of Business. 
Science Applications International Corporation (collectively, with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”) is a leading provider of technical, engineering and enterprise information technology ("IT") services primarily to the U.S. government. The Company integrates emerging technology securely and in real-time into mission critical operations that modernize and enable national imperatives. The Company provides these services for large, complex projects with a targeted emphasis on higher-end, differentiated technology services and solutions that accelerate and transform secure and resilient digital environments through system development, modernization, integration, and sustainment to drive enterprise and mission outcomes.
Effective February 3, 2024, the first day of fiscal 2025, the Company completed a business reorganization which replaced its previous two operating sectors with five customer facing business groups supported by the enterprise organizations, including the Innovation Factory. The Company's 
five
 business groups, which are also its operating segments, are aggregated into 
two
 reportable segments for financial reporting purposes given the similarity in economic and qualitative characteristics, and based on the nature of the customers they serve. The Company’s 
two
 reportable segments are the Defense and Intelligence segment and the Civilian segment. 
The Defense and Intelligence segment provides a diverse portfolio of national security solutions to the Department of Defense ("DoD") and Intelligence Community of the United States Government. 
The Civilian segment provides solutions to the civilian markets, encompassing federal, state, and local governments, in order to deliver services for citizen well-being, border security, and protecting lives. This includes integrating solutions into a spectrum of public service missions that impact travel, trade, health and the economy.
The offerings of both reportable segments entail the integration of emerging technologies into mission critical operations that modernize and enable national imperatives, including IT modernization, digital engineering, artificial intelligence ("AI"), mission systems support and advisory, training and simulation, and ground vehicles support. These services include end-to-end solutions spanning the design, development, integration, deployment, management and operations, sustainment and security of the customers’ entire IT infrastructure.
The Company's Innovation Factory supports the operating segments by developing enterprise-class solutions which are delivered to the Company's customers as stand-alone solutions or integrated with and aligned to product offerings through the operations of the business to meet complex customer needs and accelerate digital transformation. The Innovation Factory includes designated teams focused on AI, application development, network services, platforms and cloud, engineering, and cybersecurity. It uses a highly automated, cloud-hosted tool set to rapidly build, test and deploy solutions and works with customers to enhance solutions going forward. 
Costs associated with corporate functions that are not allocable to the reportable segments are presented as Corporate activities. See Note 16—Business Segments Information for additional information.

Within this report, the Company has recast historical financial information to reflect the new reportable segments. The recast historical information has no impact on the Company's previously reported consolidated financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
References to “financial statements” refer to the consolidated financial statements of the Company, which include the statements of income and comprehensive income, balance sheets, statements of equity and statements of cash flows. These financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). All intercompany transactions and account balances within the Company have been eliminated.
Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. "Acquisition and integration costs" are now presented within "Other operating (income) expense" on the consolidated statements of income. "Inventories, net" are now presented within "Other current assets" on the consolidated balance sheets. "Amortization of off-market customer contracts," "Amortization of debt issuance costs," 
F-10
Table of Contents
SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
and "Impairment of assets" are now presented in "Other" within "Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities" on the consolidated statements of cash flows. "Distributions to non-controlling interest are now presented in "Other" within "Cash flows from financing activities" on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Non-controlling Interest. 
On February 4, 2023, the Company sold 
0.1
% of its 
50.1
% majority ownership interest in Forfeiture Support Associates J.V. ("FSA") to its sole joint venture partner for a nominal amount. As a result of the sale and amendment to the joint venture operating agreement of FSA, the Company no longer controls the joint venture and accounts for its retained interest as an equity method investment as of the date of the transaction. Prior to February 4, 2023, the Company held a 
50.1
% majority interest in FSA. For fiscal 2023, the results of operations of FSA were included in the Company's consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and statements of cash flows.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the financial statements may include, but are not limited to, estimated profitability of long-term contracts, income taxes, fair value measurements, fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets, pension and defined benefit plan obligations, and contingencies. Estimates have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current and best available information at the time of estimation and actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reporting Periods
The Company utilizes a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday closest to January 31, with fiscal quarters typically consisting of 13 weeks. Fiscal 2025 began on February 3, 2024 and ended on January 31, 2025, fiscal 2024 began on February 4, 2023 and ended on February 2, 2024, and fiscal 2023 began on January 29, 2022 and ended on February 3, 2023. Fiscal 2025 and 2024 consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal 2023 consisted of 53 weeks.
Revenue Recognition
The Company provides technical, engineering and enterprise IT services under long-term service arrangements primarily with the U.S. government, including subcontracts with other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government. The Company also serves a number of state and local governments, foreign governments and U.S. commercial customers. 
The Company provides services under various contract types, including fixed price contracts such as firm-fixed price ("FFP"), time-and-materials ("T&M") contracts including fixed-price-level-of-effort contracts, and cost reimbursement contracts such as cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee and cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts. The Company's service arrangements typically involve an annual base period of performance followed by renewal option periods that upon exercise are generally accounted for as separate contracts.
To determine the proper revenue recognition, the Company first evaluates whether there is a duly approved and enforceable contract with a customer, in which rights of parties and payment terms are identified and collectability is probable. The Company also evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether modifications to existing contracts should be accounted for as part of the original contract or as a separate contract. Contract modifications that create new enforceable rights and obligations are accounted for prospectively. Contract modifications that do not add distinct goods or services are accounted for through cumulative catch-up adjustments. Contract modifications that add distinct goods or services and increase the contract value by an amount that reflects the standalone selling price are accounted for as separate contracts. 
The Company recognizes revenue when, or as, performance obligations under a contract are satisfied. A performance obligation is the unit of account for revenue recognition and refers to a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct service or good to the customer. The majority of the Company’s contracts contain a single performance obligation involving a significant integration of various activities that are performed together to deliver a combined service or solution. Performance obligations may be satisfied over time or at a point in time, but the majority of the 
F-11
Table of Contents
SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time. The Company selects the appropriate measure of progress for revenue recognition based on the nature of the performance obligation, contract type and other pertinent contract terms.
Performance obligations satisfied over time may involve a series of recurring services, such as network operations and maintenance, operation and program support services, IT outsourcing services, and other IT arrangements where the Company is standing ready to provide support, when-and-if needed. Such performance obligations are satisfied over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company's performance as services are provided. Alternatively, performance obligations satisfied over time may involve the completion of a contract deliverable. Examples include systems integration, network engineering, network design, and engineering and build services. Deliverable-based performance obligations are satisfied over time when the Company’s performance creates or enhances an asset that is controlled by the customer, or when the Company’s performance creates an asset that is customized to the customer’s specifications and the Company has a right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for work performed to date. 
For series-services performance obligations, the Company measures progress using either a cost input measure (cost-to-cost), a time-elapsed output measure, or the as-invoiced practical expedient. A cost input measure or the as-invoiced practical expedient typically is applied to the Company’s cost-reimbursable contracts. Revenue is recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion. Award or incentive fees are allocated to the distinct periods to which they relate. For fixed-price contracts, a time-elapsed output measure is applied to fixed consideration, such that revenue is recognized ratably over the period of performance. Where fixed-price contracts also provide for reimbursement of certain costs, such as travel or other direct costs, consideration may be attributed only to a distinct subset of time within the performance period. The Company’s time-and-material, fixed price-level of effort, and certain cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts generally qualify for the as-invoiced practical expedient. Revenue on these contracts is recognized in the amount to which the Company has a contractual right to invoice. 
For deliverable-based performance obligations satisfied over time, the Company recognizes revenue using a cost input measure of progress (cost-to-cost), regardless of contract type. Revenue is recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion.
The Company may incur costs associated with significant materials or hardware procurements that are not proportionate to the Company’s progress in satisfying its performance obligations. For these contracts, costs are excluded from the measure of progress, and revenue is recognized equal to the costs incurred.
For performance obligations in which the Company does not transfer control over time, the Company recognizes revenue at the point-in-time when the customer obtains control of the related asset, usually at the time of shipment or upon delivery. The Company accrues for shipping and handling costs occurring after the point-in-time control transfers to the customer. 
Recognizing revenue on long-term contracts involves significant estimates and judgments. The transaction price is the estimated amount of consideration the Company expects to receive for performance under the Company's contracts. Contract terms may include variable consideration, such as reimbursable costs, award and incentive fees, usage-based fees, service-level penalties, performance bonuses, or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. Variable amounts are generally determined upon the Company's achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and may be based upon customer discretion. When making estimates, the Company considers the customer, contract terms, the complexity of the work and related risks, the extent of customer discretion, historical experience and the potential of a significant reversal of revenue. The Company includes variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of each distinct performance obligation within the contract. Since the Company typically provides customized services and solutions that are specific to a single customer’s requirements, standalone selling price is most often estimated based on expected costs plus a reasonable profit margin.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Changes in Estimates on Contracts
Changes in estimates of revenues, cost of revenues or profits related to performance obligations satisfied over time are recognized in operating income in the period in which such changes are made for the inception-to-date effect of the changes. Changes in these estimates can occur routinely over the performance period for a variety of reasons, which include: changes in scope; changes in cost estimates due to unanticipated cost growth or reassessments of risks impacting costs; changes in the estimated transaction price, such as variable amounts for incentive or award fees; and performance being better or worse than previously estimated. 
A significant portion of the Company's contracts recognize revenue on performance obligations using a cost input measure (cost-to-cost), which requires estimates of total costs at completion. Estimating costs at completion is complex due to the nature of the services being performed and the length of certain contracts. Contract costs generally include direct costs, such as labor, subcontract costs and materials, and indirect costs identifiable with or allocable to a specific contract. Management must make assumptions regarding the complexity of the work to be performed, the schedule and associated tasks, labor productivity and availability, increases in wages and prices of materials, execution by the Company's subcontractors, overhead cost rates, and other variables. For contracts using a cost input measure, when total expected contract costs exceed total estimated contract revenues, the Company recognizes the total estimated loss in the quarter identified. Total estimated losses are inclusive of any unexercised options that are probable of award, only if they increase the amount of the loss. Contract costs incurred for U.S. government contracts, including indirect costs, are subject to audit and adjustment by the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA").
Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of billing and cash receipts from customers. Amounts are invoiced as work progresses, typically biweekly or monthly in arrears, or upon achievement of contractual milestones. The Company records a contract asset when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or a contract liability when cash is received in advance of recognizing revenue. A contract asset is a right to consideration that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. Contract assets include unbillable receivables and contract retentions, but exclude billed and billable receivables. Billed and billable receivables are rights to consideration, which are unconditional other than to the passage of time. Contract liabilities include customer advances, billings in excess of revenues and deferred revenue. Contract assets and liabilities are recorded net on a contract-by-contract basis and are generally classified as current based on the Company's contract operating cycle. Deferred revenue attributable to long-term contract material renewal options may be classified as non-current when the option renewal period will not occur within one year of the balance sheet date.
Deferred Costs
Certain eligible costs, such as costs to obtain and costs to fulfill the Company's service contracts, are capitalized when the costs relate directly to the contract, are expected to be recovered, and generate or enhance resources to be used in satisfying the performance obligation. These costs primarily consist of commissions, transition and set-up costs. Capitalized costs to obtain and fulfill a contract are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which generally includes the contract base period and anticipated renewals. 
The Company performs periodic reviews to assess the recoverability of deferred contract transition and setup costs. The carrying amount of the asset is compared to the remaining amount of consideration the Company expects to receive for the services to which the asset relates, less the costs that relate directly to providing those services that have not yet been recognized. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized.
Pre-contract costs are deferred when eligible costs are incurred prior to the start of a contract and it is probable the costs will be recovered upon contract issuance. Pre-contract costs are expensed when the contract is executed.
Prepaid contract costs may be incurred for certain customer contracts to secure the use of assets or the receipt of services at a future date or over a period of time. For contracts using the as-invoiced practical expedient or a time-elapsed revenue recognition measure, prepaid contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit.

SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Costs Allocated to Contracts
The Company classifies indirect costs as overhead (included in cost of revenues) or general and administrative expenses in the same manner as such costs are defined in the Company’s Disclosure Statements under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards ("CAS").
Stock-based Compensation
The Company issues stock-based awards as compensation to employees and directors. Stock-based awards include stock options, vesting stock awards and performance share awards. These awards are accounted for as equity awards. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the underlying award’s requisite service period, as measured using the award’s grant date fair value. For performance share awards, the Company reassesses the probability of achieving the performance conditions at each reporting period end and adjusts compensation expense based on the number of shares the Company expects to ultimately vest. Under the Company's stock-based compensation arrangements, upon vesting, shares are often withheld from the award for the purposes of satisfying statutory withholding tax obligations.

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Under this method, changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in income in the period such changes are enacted. The provision for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. 
Recording the provision for income taxes requires management to make significant judgments and estimates for matters for which the ultimate resolution may not become known until the final resolution of an examination by taxing authorities or the statute of limitations lapses. Additionally, recording liabilities for uncertainty in income taxes involves significant judgment in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and developing the best estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid. Tax penalties and interest are included in income tax expense.
The Company has also recognized liabilities for uncertainty in income taxes when it is more likely than not that a tax position will not be sustained on examination and settlement with various taxing authorities. The Company records the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled. To the extent the Company prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, the Company's effective tax rate in a given financial period may be materially impacted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted by taxable jurisdiction and classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheets.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash in banks and highly liquid instruments, which primarily consist of bank deposits and investments in institutional money market funds. The Company includes outstanding payments within "Cash and cash equivalents" and "Accounts payable" on the consolidated balance sheets and as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024 these amounts were $
33
 million and $
26
 million, respectively. The Company does not invest in high yield or high risk securities. The cash in bank accounts at times may exceed federally insured limits.

Receivables
Receivables include billed and billable receivables, and unbilled receivables. The Company’s receivables are primarily due from the U.S. government, or from prime contractors on which we are subcontractors and the end customer is the U.S. government, and are generally considered collectable from the perspective of the customer’s ability to pay. The Company does not have a material credit risk exposure.
Unbilled receivables, substantially all of which are expected to be billed and collected within 
one year
, are stated at their estimated realizable value and consist of costs and fees billable on contract completion or the occurrence of a specified event, other than the passage of time. Legal title to the related accumulated costs of contracts in progress generally vests with the U.S. government on the Company’s receipt of progress payments. Progress payments received of $
82
 million and $
90
 million offset unbilled receivables as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, respectively. Contract retentions are billed when contract conditions have been met and may relate to uncompleted indirect cost negotiations with the U.S. government. Based on historical experience, the majority of retention balances are expected to be collected beyond one year. Retention is presented in "Other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets, see Note 3—Revenues. Write-offs of retention balances have not been significant. 
Receivable balances are written-off in the period during which management determines they are uncollectable, and, at that time, such balances are removed from billed receivables and, if previously reserved, from the allowance.
Inventories
Inventory is substantially comprised of finished goods and is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, generally using the average cost method. The Company evaluates current inventory against historical and planned usage to estimate the appropriate provision for obsolete inventory.
Business Combinations
The Company records all tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at fair value as of the acquisition date, which is determined using a cost, market or income approach. The excess amount of the aggregated purchase consideration paid over the fair value of the net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition date fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as measured on the acquisition date.
The valuations are based on information that existed as of the acquisition date. During the measurement period that shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date, the Company may adjust provisional amounts recorded for assets acquired and liabilities assumed to reflect new information that the Company has subsequently obtained regarding facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.
Acquisition and Integration Costs
Acquisition-related costs that are not part of the purchase price consideration are generally expensed as incurred, except for certain costs that are deferred in connection with the issuance of debt. These costs typically include transaction-related costs, such as finder’s fees, legal, accounting and other professional costs. Integration-related 
F-15
Table of Contents
SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
costs represent costs directly related to combining the Company and its acquired businesses. Integration-related costs typically include strategic consulting services, facility consolidation, employee related costs, such as retention and severance, costs to integrate information technology infrastructure, enterprise planning systems, processes, and other non-recurring integration-related costs. Acquisition and integration costs are presented within "Other operating (income) expense" on the consolidated statements of income.
The Company's acquisition and integration costs were as follows for the periods presented:

(1)    Acquisition costs in fiscal 2025 include a reversal of immaterial costs related to the fiscal 2022 Koverse acquisition. Acquisition costs in fiscal 2023 reflect adjustments to the fair value of the Koverse earnout liability.
Restructuring Costs
The Company periodically initiates restructuring activities to support business strategies, realign resources, and enhance its operational efficiency. Restructuring costs may include severance and other employee related termination costs, costs associated with consolidating or closing facilities and consulting costs. 
One-time involuntary employee termination benefits are recognized as a liability and measured at fair value when the plan of termination has been communicated to employees and certain other criteria are met. Ongoing employee termination benefit arrangements are recognized as a liability and measured at fair value when it is probable that amounts will be paid and such amounts are reasonably estimable. Other employee related termination costs include the impact of accelerated stock compensation expense for terminated employees that have a reduction in the requisite service period for their stock-based awards.
Costs to consolidate or close facilities primarily include lease obligation charges for exited facilities, including the impact of accelerated lease expense for right of use assets and accelerated depreciation expense for leasehold improvements with reductions in their estimated useful lives due to exited facilities.
Leases
The Company occupies most of its facilities under operating leases. Certain equipment is also leased under short-term or cancelable operating leases.
The Company recognizes a right of use ("ROU") asset and a lease liability upon the commencement of its operating leases. The initial lease liability is equal to the future fixed minimum lease payments discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate on a secured basis. The lease term includes option renewal periods and early termination payments when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those rights. The initial measurement of the ROU asset is equal to the initial lease liability plus any initial direct costs and prepayments, less any lease incentives. 
The Company recognizes lease costs on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term, except for variable lease payments that are expensed in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.
For its facility leases, the Company combines and accounts for lease and non-lease components together as a single component. The Company does not recognize lease liabilities and ROU assets for leases with original terms of 12 months or less. ROU assets are evaluated for impairment as a long-lived asset.
The Company leases IT equipment and hardware to its customers. All of the Company’s lessor arrangements are operating leases. Operating lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is presented in "Revenues" on the consolidated statements of income.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill is recorded as the difference, if any, between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are tested for potential impairment annually at the beginning of the Company's fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. There were 
no
 impairments during the periods presented.
The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. In the Company’s qualitative assessment, an evaluation is performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists based on qualitative factors. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, relevant entity-specific events, factors affecting the reporting unit, and share price.
The Company may additionally perform a quantitative assessment in which the fair value of the Company’s reporting units are determined using either a market approach, income approach, or a combination of both, which involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including projected future operating results and cash flows, the cost of capital, and financial measures derived from observable market data of comparable public companies. The Company estimates and compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the amount of impairment expense is equal to the difference between the reporting unit’s fair value and the reporting unit’s carrying value.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the method that best reflects how their economic benefits are utilized or, if a pattern of economic benefits cannot be reliably determined, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable at the asset group level.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Purchases of property, plant, and equipment, as well as costs associated with major renewals and betterments, are capitalized. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals and betterments are expensed as incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and any resulting gain or loss is recognized. See Note 7—Property, Plant, and Equipment for depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives by major asset class.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets
The Company evaluates its long-lived assets (including right of use lease assets) for potential impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows (including sublease income) at the asset group level. When the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset’s carrying amount to its estimated fair value based on the present value of its estimated future cash flows.
In circumstances in which the Company has the ability and intent to sublease an exited facility, the Company performs an impairment test of the asset group (mainly consisting of right of use lease assets and leasehold improvements) on the earlier of the cease use date or sublease inception date by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset group (mainly sublease income). When the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset group’s carrying amount to its estimated fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. In circumstances in which the Company does not have the ability or intent to sublease an exited facility, the Company adjusts the estimated useful life of the facility related assets to end on the cease use date and recognizes accelerated depreciation and amortization.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Commitments and Contingencies
Accruals for commitments and loss contingencies are recorded when it is both probable that they will occur and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. In addition, legal fees are accrued for cases where a loss is probable and the related fees can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss. The Company reviews these accruals quarterly and adjusts the accruals to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information.
Pension and Defined Benefit Plans
The Company measures plan assets and benefit obligations as of the month-end that is closest to its fiscal year-end. Accounting and reporting for the Company's pension and defined benefit plans requires the use of assumptions, including but not limited to, a discount rate and an expected return on assets. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually based on reviews of current plan information and consultation with the Company's independent actuary and the plans’ investment advisor. If these assumptions differ materially from actual results, the Company's obligations under the pension and defined benefit plans could also differ materially, potentially requiring the Company to record an additional liability. The Company's pension and defined benefit plan liabilities are developed from actuarial valuations performed each year.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company utilizes fair value measurement guidance prescribed by GAAP to value its financial instruments. The accounting standard for fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets (Level 1); inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2); and unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires the Company to develop its own assumptions (Level 3).
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and other amounts included in other current assets and current liabilities that meet the definition of a financial instrument approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these amounts. The carrying value of the Company’s outstanding debt obligations approximates its fair value, which is calculated using Level 2 inputs, based on interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to the Company’s existing debt arrangements.
Non-financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at fair value using income, market and cost valuation methodologies.
Marketable Securities
Investments in marketable securities consist of equity securities, which are recorded at fair value using observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets (Level 1). As of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024, the fair value of the Company's investments totaled $
36
 million and $
32
 million, respectively, and are primarily included in "Other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's investments are primarily held in a custodial account, which includes investments to fund its deferred compensation plan liabilities.
Derivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges
Derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings in a manner that matches the timing of the earnings impact of the hedged transactions. Settlement amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are presented within operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Table of Contents
SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company’s fixed interest rate swaps are considered over-the-counter derivatives, and their fair value is calculated using a standard pricing model for interest rate swaps with contractual terms for maturities, amortization and interest rates. Level 2, or market observable inputs (such as yield and credit curves), are used within the standard pricing models in order to determine fair value. The fair value is an estimate of the amount that the Company would pay or receive as of a measurement date if the agreements were transferred to a third party. See Note 12—Derivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges for further discussion on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.
Operating Cycle
The Company’s operating cycle may be greater than one year and is represented by the average time intervening between the inception and the completion of contracts.

Research and Development
The Company conducts research and development activities under customer-funded contracts and with company-funded independent research and development ("IR&D") funds. IR&D efforts consist of projects involving basic research, applied research, development, and systems and other concept formulation studies. Company-funded IR&D expense is included in "Selling, general and administrative expenses" and was $
12
 million, $
4
 million and $
1
 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Customer-funded research and development activities performed under customer contracts are charged directly to cost of revenues for those particular contracts.
Investments in Equity Securities
The Company invests in certain companies that advance or develop new technologies applicable to its business. The Company also occasionally forms joint ventures as a part of its investment strategy for the purpose of bidding and executing on specific projects. Each investment is evaluated for consolidation under the variable interest entities ("VIEs") model and/or the voting interest model. The results of these investments are not material to the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.
The Company applies the equity method of accounting to its unconsolidated investments when it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity and recognizes its proportionate share of the entities’ net income or loss within "Other operating (income) expense" on the consolidated statements of income. Equity investments in entities over which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and whose securities do not have a readily determinable fair value are carried at cost or cost net of other-than-temporary impairments.
Sale of Equity Method Investment
On August 30, 2024, Morpheus Data, one of the Company’s unconsolidated venture investments, completed a transaction to sell all its outstanding equity, including the Company's equity investment, to Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) for $
10
 million in cash. The Company recognized the cash as "Proceeds from sale of equity method investments" on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $
5
 million which is included within "Other operating (income) expense" on the consolidated statements of income.
Accounting Standards Updates
Accounting Standards Updates Recently Adopted
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. Amongst other amendments, the standard requires annual and interim disclosures of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), and interim disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. This standard does not change how an entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The standard was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The

Company adopted the annual disclosure requirements in fiscal 2025 and will adopt the interim disclosure requirements in fiscal 2026. See Note 16—Business Segments Information for additional information. 
Accounting Standards Updates Recently Issued But Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. 
The standard includes amendments that enhance annual income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments can be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis. The Company plans to adopt this standard prospectively in fiscal 2026 and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued 
ASU 
No. 2024-03, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. The standard includes new disclosure requirements relating to specified categories of expenses (purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization) that are included in certain expense captions presented on the face of the income statement. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments can be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis. In January 2025, the FASB clarified the effective date of the standard by issuing ASU No. 2025-01, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard on its financial statement disclosures.
Note 2—Earnings Per Share, Share Repurchases and Dividends:
Earnings Per Share ("EPS")
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the basic weighted-average number of shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed similarly to basic EPS, except the weighted-average number of shares outstanding is increased to include the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and other stock-based awards. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and other stock-based awards is computed using the treasury stock method.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding used to compute basic and diluted EPS for the periods presented:

Share Repurchases
The Company may repurchase shares in accordance with established repurchase plans. The Company retires its common stock upon repurchase with the excess over par value allocated to additional paid-in capital. When repurchases for the period exceed total additional-paid-in-capital, the excess repurchases are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. The Company has not made any material purchases of common stock other than in connection with established share repurchase plans.
In December 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $
1.2
 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock under its existing share repurchase plan. This authorization was effective as of December 16, 2024 and has no expiration date. Since the program’s inception in December of 2013, the Company has repurchased approximately 
24.5
 million shares of its common stock from the open market for approximately $
2.1
 billion, which included amounts previously authorized under the plan prior to December 2024. 
Dividends
The Company declared and paid quarterly dividends of $
0.37
 per share every quarter for the years presented. Total dividends declared and paid were $
1.48

Note 4—Divestitures:
FSA Amendment
On February 4, 2023, the Company sold 
0.1
% of its 
50.1
% majority ownership interest in FSA to its sole joint venture partner for a nominal amount. In conjunction with the sale, the Company remeasured its retained investment in FSA to a fair value of $
14
 million. As a result of the sale and amendment to the joint venture operating agreement of FSA, the Company no longer controls the joint venture and accounts for its retained interest as an equity method investment as of the date of the transaction. 
The equity method investment is included within "Other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets. The remeasurement resulted in a gain of $
7
 million which is included within "(Gain) loss on divestitures, net of transaction costs" on the consolidated statements of income and is reflected within "Gain on divestitures" on the consolidated statements of cash flows in fiscal 2024. The Company estimated the fair value of its retained investment in FSA based on Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy. The Company used the income approach which involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, projected operating margins, discount rates and terminal growth rates.
Sale of Logistics and Supply Chain Management Business
On May 6, 2023, the Company closed the sale of its logistics and supply chain management business ("Supply Chain Business") to ASRC Federal Holding Company, LLC ("ASRC Federal") for $
356
 million in cash. The sale enables the Company to focus its resources on long-term strategic growth areas. The Company recognized the cash as "Proceeds from divestitures" on the consolidated statements of cash flows in fiscal 2024. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $
233
 million, net of $
7
 million of transaction costs, which is included within "(Gain) loss on divestitures, net of transaction costs" on the consolidated statements of income in fiscal 2024.

As a result of the internal reorganization on February 3, 2024, the Company reallocated its goodwill to its five new goodwill reporting units. The Company performed a goodwill impairment test immediately before and after the reorganization, both of which resulted in 
no
 impairment. For the goodwill impairment test immediately after the reorganization, the Company performed a quantitative assessment of its goodwill as of February 3, 2024 for its 
five
 new goodwill reporting units. The Company estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using a 50:50 weighting of fair values derived from an income approach and market approach.
Under the income approach, the Company estimated the fair value of its reporting units using a multi-year discounted cash flow model involving assumptions about projected future revenue growth, operating margins, income tax rates, capital expenditures, discount rate, and terminal value. Under the market approach, the Company estimated the fair value of its reporting units based on multiples of earnings derived from observable market data of comparable public companies.

Note 8—Stock-Based Compensation
:
Plan Summaries
As of January 31, 2025, the Company had stock-based compensation awards outstanding under the following plans: “2023 Equity Incentive Plan” ("2023 EIP"), “2013 Equity Incentive Plan” ("2013 EIP"), “Management Stock Compensation Plan”, and the “Amended and Restated 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan” ("ESPP") which are herein referred to together as the “Plans.” The Company issues new shares on the vesting of stock awards or exercise of stock options under these Plans. During fiscal year 2024, the Company terminated the Third Amended and Restated 2012 Long Term Performance Plan ("LTPP") and deregistered all remaining unissued shares thereunder.
On June 7, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2023 EIP. The 2023 EIP authorized 
2.2
 million new shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share, to be issued as various types of stock-based compensation and cash awards. Awards previously issued and outstanding under the 2013 EIP will continue to remain outstanding and be subject to the terms of the 2013 EIP. After June 7, 2023, no new awards may be issued under the 2013 EIP and any awards that subsequently expire, are forfeited or canceled, are settled in cash, or are used to cover recipient tax obligations, will become available for issuance under the 2023 Plan. As of January 31, 2025, the total authorized shares of common stock for issuance under the 2023 EIP is 
1.9
 million.
F-28
Table of Contents
SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The 2023 EIP and 2013 EIP both provide the Company’s employees and directors the opportunity to receive various types of stock-based compensation and cash awards. The terms of the stock-based awards granted to employees and directors are the same, except that those for directors cliff vest within 
one year
 of the grant date. As of January 31, 2025, the Company has unvested stock and performance share awards under the 2023 EIP and 2013 EIP and outstanding stock options under the 2013 EIP. Vesting stock awards granted in fiscal 2020 and thereafter generally vest equally over three years, while vesting stock awards granted prior to fiscal 2020 generally vest equally over four years. Stock options generally become exercisable evenly over three years. The maximum contractual term for stock options is 
ten years
, but historically the Company has granted stock options with a 
seven-year
 contractual term. The requisite service period for stock-based awards is accelerated for employees meeting certain retirement eligibility conditions. Certain officers are eligible for continued vesting of previously granted awards upon termination of employment or voluntary retirement, subject to the conditions set forth in the Company’s Executive Severance, Change in Control and Retirement Policy effective July 1, 2020. Stock-based awards generally provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control (as defined in the 2023 EIP and 2013 EIP, as applicable). Vesting stock awards and performance share awards have forfeitable rights to dividends.
Performance shares are rights to receive shares of the Company’s stock upon satisfaction of certain requirements. Performance-based stock awards granted prior to fiscal 2022 include service and performance conditions. Performance-based stock awards granted in fiscal 2022 and thereafter also include market conditions. For performance-based stock awards granted prior to fiscal 2023, the performance metrics are based on annual operating cash flows and a three year cumulative measure of earnings. For performance-based stock awards granted in fiscal 2023 and thereafter, the performance metrics are based on three year cumulative operating cash flows and a three year cumulative measure of earnings. The market conditions for awards granted in fiscal 2022 and thereafter are based on the Company's total shareholder return over the three year performance period as compared to the total shareholder return for a specified group of companies over the same period. These awards cliff vest at the end of the third fiscal year following the grant date, subject to meeting the minimum service requirements and the achievement of the Company’s performance metrics and market conditions, with the number of shares ultimately issued, if any, ranging up to 
200
% of the specified target shares. If performance is below a minimum threshold level of performance, no shares will be issued. 
The Management Stock Compensation Plan provides for awards in share units to eligible employees. Benefits are payable in shares of the Company’s stock that are held in a trust for the purpose of funding benefit payments to the participants. During fiscal 2017, all remaining outstanding awards in the Management Stock Compensation Plan vested. The Board of Directors may at any time amend or terminate the Management Stock Compensation Plan. In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined by the Management Stock Compensation Plan), participant accounts will be immediately distributed, otherwise participant accounts will generally be distributed upon retirement based on the participant’s payout election, or upon termination. The Management Stock Compensation Plan does not provide for a maximum number of shares available for future issuance.
On June 7, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved an amended and restated ESPP which limits the total number of shares reserved for issuance to 
2.0
 million and extends the plan’s expiration date from September 26, 2023 to the earlier of its termination by the Board of Directors or the issuance of all shares available for issuance thereunder. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a discount of up to 
15
% of the fair market value on the date of purchase. During the three fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, the ESPP discount was 
5
% of the fair market value on the date of purchase, thereby resulting in the ESPP being non-compensatory. As of January 31, 2025, 
1.7
 million shares of the Company’s common stock are authorized for issuance under the ESPP.
The LTPP provides certain employees of the Company the opportunity to receive various types of stock-based compensation awards. Vesting stock awards issued under the LTPP generally cliff vest at the end of the third fiscal year following the grant date. Vesting may be accelerated for employees meeting retirement eligibility conditions. Vesting stock awards under the LTPP have forfeitable rights to dividends.

% of the specified target shares. In the table above, the number of performance shares are presented at 
100
% of the specified target shares, except for awards that vested and the performance adjustment. The vested amount reflects the number of shares to be issued based on the actual achievement of the performance goals for shares that vested during the period. The performance adjustment amount reflects the increase or decrease in the number of performance shares vested compared to the number of performance shares that would have vested at target. 
The weighted-average grant date fair value of the performance share awards granted in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $
128.17
, $
116.25
 and $
100.94
, respectively. The grant date fair value of performance shares was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model that incorporated multiple valuation assumptions, including the Company's expected total shareholder return relative to a specified group of companies defined within the award agreement. The primary assumptions included an expected volatility of 
24.16
%, 
27.35
%, and 
38.02
% for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a risk-free interest rate of 
4.46
%, 
3.68
% and 
2.44
% for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company over a period commensurate with the expected term of the award as of the date of grant. The risk-free interest rate was based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award on the date of grant.
The fair value of performance share awards that vested in fiscal 2025 was $
18
 million. As of January 31, 2025 there was $
19
 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to performance share awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

 years.

Note 9—Retirement Plans
:
Defined Contribution Plans
The Company sponsors the Science Applications International Corporation Retirement Plan (a qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan) and an employee stock ownership plan, in which most employees are eligible to participate. There are a variety of investment options available, including the Company's stock.
The Science Applications International Corporation Retirement Plan allows eligible participants to contribute a portion of their income through payroll deductions and the Company makes matching company contributions and may also make discretionary contributions. The Company contributions expensed for defined contribution plans were

$
86
 million, $
82
 million and $
80
 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Deferred Compensation Plans
The Company maintains the Science Applications International Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP") which provides certain eligible employees and directors an opportunity to defer some or all of their compensation on an unfunded, nonqualified basis. Participant deferrals are fully vested and diversified at the participant’s direction among the investment options offered under the DCP. Participant accounts are credited with a rate of return based on the performance of the investment options selected. Distributions are made in cash. Deferred balances are paid on retirement based on the participant’s payout election, or upon termination. The Company may provide discretionary contributions to participants, but no Company contributions have been made.
The Science Applications International Corporation Key Executive Stock Deferral Plan ("KESDP") was closed on December 31, 2014, and no further deferrals are allowed. Benefits from the KESDP are payable in shares of the Company’s stock that may be held in trust for the purpose of funding benefit payments to KESDP participants. Vested deferred balances are paid on retirement based on the participant’s payout election, or upon termination.
The Science Applications International Corporation 401(k) Excess Deferral Plan ("Excess Plan") was also closed on December 31, 2014, and no further deferrals are allowed. Participant deferrals are fully vested and diversified at the participant’s direction among the investment options offered under the Excess Plan. Deferred balances are paid on retirement or termination.
Defined Benefit Plans
In connection with the acquisition of Engility Holdings, Inc. ("Engility") in fiscal 2019, the Company assumed two defined benefit plans sponsored by Engility for certain current and former employees: a Defined Benefit Pension Plan ("Pension Plan") and a Retiree Health Reimbursement Account Plan ("RHRA Benefit Plan"). Membership and participants' calculated pension benefit are frozen in the Pension Plan and membership in the RHRA Benefit Plan is frozen. 
The Company's funding policy is to contribute at least the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Additional amounts are contributed to assure that plan assets will be adequate to provide retirement benefits. During fiscal 2026, the Company expects to contribute $
3
 million to fund the Pension Plan and $
1
 million to fund the RHRA Benefit Plan, respectively.
During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Company recognized a net gain of $
3
 million and $
1
 million, respectively, on its retirement plans within other comprehensive income primarily due to an increase in discount rates and the difference between actual investment return and expected return.
During fiscal 2023, the Company recognized a net gain of $
4
 million on its retirement plans within other comprehensive income. The gain was comprised of a $
10
 million gain due to an increase in discount rates, partially offset by a $
6
 million loss due to the difference between actual investment return and expected return.

SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The discount rates represent the estimated rate at which the Company could effectively settle its defined benefit obligations using a high quality bond yield curve.
The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets, which is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants, is determined by an annual review of historical returns on plan assets. In selecting the expected long-term rate of return on assets used for the Pension Plan, the Company considered its investment return goals stated in the Pension Plan's investment policy. This process included determining expected returns for the various asset classes that comprise the Pension Plan's target asset allocation.
The following assumptions were used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs:

Pension Plan Assets
The Company's investment policy includes a periodic review of the Pension Plan's investment in the various asset classes. During fiscal 2025, the Company's overall investment strategy was for plan assets to achieve a long-term rate of return of 
5.25
%, with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. The target allocation for the plan assets is 
44
% in domestic equity securities, 
20
% international equity securities, 
31
% in fixed income securities and 
5
% in cash and cash equivalents. The risk management practices include regular evaluations of fund managers to ensure the risk assumed is commensurate with the given investment style and objectives. According to the plan's investment policy, performance will be evaluated across all time periods, with a particular emphasis on longer-term returns relative to associated peers and benchmarks.

The GDA is designed to provide liquidity and safety of principal with a competitive guaranteed rate of return. The fair value of the GDA approximates the market value of underlying investments by discounting expected future investment cash flow from both investment income and repayment of principal for each investment purchased directly for the defined benefit segment of the General Account. Principal and accumulated interest are fully guaranteed by Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company ("PRIAC"). The declared interest rate is announced each year in advance and is determined by PRIAC. The GDA invests in a broadly diversified, fixed-income portfolio within PRIAC's general account. The portfolio is invested in public bonds, commercial mortgages and private placement bonds.

(1)    The stated interest rate for the Revolving Credit Facility due June 2027 reflects the weighted-average interest rate for the outstanding borrowings as of January 31, 2025.
As of January 31, 2025, the Company has a $
2.6
 billion secured credit facility (the "Credit Facility") consisting of a Term Loan A Facility due June 2027, a Term Loan B3 Facility due February 2031 (together, the "Term Loan Facilities"), and a $
1.0
 billion secured Revolving Credit Facility due June 2027 (the "Revolving Credit Facility").
The Company's Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ("Third Amended Credit Agreement") contains certain restrictive covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries including a requirement to maintain a Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Third Amended Credit Agreement) of not greater than 
4.00
 to 1.00, unless a Permitted Acquisition (as defined in the Third Amended Credit Agreement) occurs in which case not greater than

% and for base rate loans from 
1.25
% to

SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On July 2, 2021, the Company executed the Fourth Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which established a new senior secured incremental term loan credit facility commitment in the amount of $
100
 million (the "Term Loan A2 Facility due October 2023").
On June 30, 2022, the Company executed the Fifth Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ("Fifth Amendment"), which established, among other things, a $
1,230
 million senior secured term loan credit facility ("Term Loan A Facility due June 2027") and increased the Revolving Credit Facility commitment from $
400
 million to $
1,000
 million. The entire Term Loan A Facility due June 2027 was immediately borrowed by the Company and the proceeds were used to pay in full the outstanding principal balances under the Term Loan A Facility due October 2023 and Term Loan A2 Facility due October 2023 and to prepay $
400
 million of principal on the Term Loan B Facility due October 2025.
Borrowings under the Term Loan A Facility due June 2027 amortize quarterly beginning on October 31, 2023 at 
1.250
% of the original borrowed amount thereunder, with such quarterly amortization increasing to 
1.875
% on October 31, 2024 and to 
2.500
% on October 31, 2025. The Term Loan A Facility due June 2027 may be prepaid at any time without penalty and is subject to the same mandatory prepayments, including from excess cash flow, as the Company’s existing term loans under the Credit Facility. 
As a result of the Fifth Amendment, the maturity date for the Revolving Credit Facility was extended to, and the maturity date of the Term Loan A Facility due June 2027 is, the earlier of June 30, 2027 or 91 days prior to the earliest term loan “B” facility maturity date (subject to acceleration in certain circumstances). The Term Loan A Facility due June 2027 is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Company’s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by each of the Company’s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. The Term Loan A Facility due June 2027 is subject to the same covenants and events of default as the Company’s existing term loans under the Credit Facility.
Effective with the Fifth Amendment, all interest rates under the Credit Facility transitioned from LIBOR to Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Term SOFR") plus 
0.10
% for US dollar denominated loans, Sterling Overnight Index Average ("SONIA") for UK pound sterling denominated loans, and Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") for Euro denominated loans. The applicable interest rate margins under the Term Loan A Facility due June 2027 and the Revolving Credit Facility were reduced to a range from 
0.75
% to 
1.75
% per annum for Term SOFR, SONIA and EURIBOR loans, and from 
0
% to 
0.75
% per annum for base rate loans, in each case based on the Company’s leverage ratio. Commitment fees for undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility were also reduced to a range of 
0.125
% to 
0.25
% per annum based on the Company’s leverage ratio.
During fiscal 2024, the Company incurred $
8
 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Fifth Amendment, of which $
2
 million was recognized in interest expense, with the remaining $
6
 million deferred and amortized to interest expense through the maturity dates of the facilities utilizing the effective interest rate method.
On February 8, 2024, the Company executed the Sixth Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ("Sixth Amendment"), which established a $
510
 million senior secured term loan credit facility ("Term Loan B3 Facility due February 2031"). The entire Term Loan B3 Facility due February 2031 was immediately borrowed by the Company and the proceeds were used to pay in full the outstanding principal balances under the Term Loan B Facility due October 2025 and Term Loan B2 Facility due March 2027. The Tranche B3 Facility due February 2031 is subject to the same covenants and events of default as the Company's existing Term Loan Facilities. Borrowings under the Term Loan B3 Facility due February 2031 amortize quarterly beginning on July 31, 2024 at 
0.25
% of the original borrowed amount with the remaining unamortized balance due in full upon its maturity on February 8, 2031.
On October 18, 2024, the Company executed the Seventh Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ("Seventh Amendment"), which lowered the applicable margin for the Term Loan B3 Facility due February 2031 from 
1.875
% to 
1.750
% for Term SOFR loans and from 
0.875
% to 
0.750
% for base rate loans. In the event any portion of the Term Loan B3 Facility due February 2031 is repaid prior to April 18, 2025 as a result of a repricing event, the Company will be required to pay a 
1.00
% fee of the amount repaid. After April 18, 2025, the Term Loan B3 Facility due February 2031 may be prepaid at any time without penalty and is subject to the same mandatory prepayments, including from excess cash flow, as the Company’s existing term loans under the Credit Facility.

The scheduled principal repayments for the Term Loan Facilities may be reduced or eliminated by annual mandatory prepayments of a portion of the Company’s Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Third Amended Credit Agreement). Mandatory prepayments are allocated to the Term Loan Facilities on a pro rata basis and reduce the remaining scheduled principal installments for each facility. During fiscal 2025, the Company made scheduled principal repayments of $

SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company is party to fixed interest rate swap instruments that are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges to manage risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on a portion of the Company’s floating rate debt within the Credit Facility. The counterparties to all swap agreements are financial institutions. See Note 13—Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income by Component for the unrealized change in fair values on cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) and the amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings for the current and comparative periods presented. During fiscal 2024, Interest Rate Swaps due October 31, 2023 matured which had a notional value of $
450
 million upon maturity. The Company estimates that it will reclassify $
6
 million of unrealized gains from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings from January 31, 2025 until the remaining interest rate swaps mature on October 31, 2025.
On June 30, 2022 and in conjunction with the Fifth Amendment, the Company transitioned the variable rate on its interest rate swaps from 1-month LIBOR to 1-month Term SOFR. Effective with the transition, the Company will pay a fixed rate of 
2.96
% on the group of interest rate swaps maturing on October 31, 2025 and paid a fixed rate of 
2.36
% on the group interest rate swaps that matured October 31, 2023. The Company elected to apply the optional expedient in ASC 848, Reference Rate Reform, in connection with transitioning its interest rate swaps from LIBOR to Term SOFR that enabled it to consider the new swaps a continuation of the existing contracts. As a result, the transition did not have an impact on the Company’s hedge accounting or a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Note 14—Sale of Receivables
:
The Company has a Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement ("MARPA Facility") with MUFG Bank, Ltd. (the "Purchaser") for the sale of up to a maximum amount of $
300
 million of certain designated eligible receivables with the U.S. government. Effective March 31, 2022, the Company amended the MARPA Facility to transition the purchase discount rate defined within the facility agreement from using LIBOR to Term SOFR. The amendment did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. The receivables sold under the MARPA Facility are without recourse for any U.S. government credit risk. The MARPA Facility automatically renews each year unless one of the parties gives prior notice to terminate.
The receivable transfers under the MARPA Facility have been recognized as sales, as the receivables had been legally isolated from the Company, the financial institution had a right to pledge or exchange the assets received and we do not maintain effective control over the transferred receivables. The fair value of the sold receivables approximated their book value due to their short-term nature. 
The Company does not retain an ongoing financial interest in the transferred receivables other than cash collection and administrative services. The Company estimated that its servicing fee was at fair value and therefore has not recognized a servicing asset or liability as of January 31, 2025 and February 2, 2024. Proceeds from the sale of receivables are reflected as cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
During fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred purchase discount fees of $
14
 million, $
9
 million and $
8
 million, respectively, which are presented in "Other (income) expense, net" on the consolidated statements of income.

Effective February 3, 2024, the first day of fiscal 2025, the Company completed a business reorganization which replaced its previous two customer facing operating sectors with five customer facing business groups supported by the enterprise organizations, including the Innovation Factory. The 
five
 business groups represent the Company’s operating segments and have been aggregated into 
two
 reportable segments (Defense and Intelligence, and Civilian) given the similarity in economic and qualitative characteristics, and based on the nature of the customers they serve. The Company defines its operating segments based on the way the CODM, currently the Company's CEO, manages the operations for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance.

The Civilian segment provides solutions to the civilian markets, encompassing federal, state, and local governments, in order to deliver services for citizen well-being, border security, and protecting lives. This includes integrating solutions into a spectrum of public service missions that impact travel, trade, health and the economy.
The offerings of both reportable segments entail the integration of emerging technologies into mission critical operations that modernize and enable national imperatives, including IT modernization, digital engineering, AI, mission systems support, training and simulation, and ground vehicles support. These services include end-to-end solutions spanning the design, development, integration, deployment, management and operations, sustainment and security of the customers’ entire IT infrastructure. 
Costs associated with corporate functions that are not allocable to the reportable segments are presented as Corporate. 
The CODM reviews and evaluates segment operating performance using segment "Revenues" and "Adjusted operating income (loss)". Adjusted operating income is a performance measure that primarily excludes the impact of non-recurring transactions that the Company does not consider to be indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance.
In fiscal 2025, the Company adopted ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. Amongst other amendments, the standard requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM. Labor base is the significant expense that is regularly provided to the Company's CODM, and primarily includes direct labor on customer contracts.
The segment information for the periods presented was as follows:

Asset information by segment is not a key measure of performance used by the CODM.
Substantially all of the Company’s revenues and tangible long-lived assets are generated and located in the United States. As such, financial information by geographic location is not presented.
In each of fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, 
98
% of the Company's total revenues were attributable to prime contracts with the U.S. government or to subcontracts with other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government.
Note 17—Legal Proceedings and Other Commitments and Contingencies
:
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal conduct of its business, none of which the Company’s management believes, based on current information, is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In April 2022 and October 2023, the Company received Federal Grand Jury Subpoenas in connection with a criminal investigation being conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division ("DOJ"). As required by the subpoenas, the Company has provided the DOJ with a broad range of documents related to the investigation,

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
and the Company’s collection and production process remains ongoing. The Company is fully cooperating with the investigation. At this time, it is not possible to determine whether the Company will incur, or to reasonably estimate the amount of, any fines, penalties or further liabilities in connection with the investigation pursuant to which the subpoenas were issued.
AAV Termination for Convenience
On August 27, 2018, the Company received a stop-work order from the United States Marine Corps on the Assault Amphibious Vehicle ("AAV") contract and on October 3, 2018 the program was terminated for convenience by the customer. In fiscal 2025, the Company entered into a $
21
 million termination settlement agreement with the customer to recover the contract costs associated with the termination, which resulted in an increase to "Revenues" of $
13
 million on the Company's consolidated statements of income in fiscal 2025. The settlement agreement releases the customer from all obligation and claims from the Company. Proceeds for the full settlement amount were received in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.
Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews
The Company is routinely subject to investigations and reviews relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect, in particular, to its role as a contractor to federal, state and local government customers and in connection with performing services in countries outside of the United States. U.S. government agencies, including the DCAA, the Defense Contract Management Agency and others, routinely audit and review a contractor’s performance on government contracts, indirect rates and pricing practices, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. They also review the adequacy of the contractor’s compliance with government standards for its business systems. Adverse findings in these investigations, audits, or reviews can lead to criminal, civil or administrative proceedings, and the Company could face disallowance of previously billed costs, penalties, fines, compensatory damages, and suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies. Due to the Company’s reliance on government contracts, adverse findings could also have a material impact on the Company’s business, including its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The indirect cost audits by the DCAA of the Company’s business remain open for certain prior years and the current year. Although the Company has recorded contract revenues based on an estimate of costs that the Company believes will be approved on final audit, the Company does not know the outcome of any ongoing or future audits. If future completed audit adjustments exceed the Company’s reserves for potential adjustments, the Company’s profitability could be materially adversely affected.
As of January 31, 2025, the Company believes it has adequately reserved for estimated net amounts to be refunded to customers for potential adjustments for indirect cost audits and compliance with CAS.
Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds
The Company has outstanding obligations relating to letters of credit of $
8
 million as of January 31, 2025, principally related to guarantees on insurance policies. The Company also has outstanding obligations relating to surety bonds in the amount of $
19
 million, principally related to performance and payment bonds on the Company’s contracts.
