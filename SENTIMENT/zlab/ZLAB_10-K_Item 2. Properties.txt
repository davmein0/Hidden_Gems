Item 2. Properties
We lease our principal executive offices in Shanghai and Cambridge, Massachusetts as well as various administrative offices in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South San Francisco, California and research and development facilities in Shanghai and a small site in San Diego, California. We also lease two manufacturing facilities, including a small molecule and a large molecule facility, in Suzhou to support production of certain of our products and product candidates. In addition, we have completed the construction of a new office and research building in Suzhou. We believe these facilities are sufficient to meet our near-term needs.
