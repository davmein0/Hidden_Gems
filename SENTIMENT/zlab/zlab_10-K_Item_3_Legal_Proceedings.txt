Overview
We are a patient-focused, innovative, commercial-stage, global biopharmaceutical company with a substantial presence in both Greater China and the United States. We are focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing products that address medical conditions with significant unmet needs in the areas of oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and infectious disease. We intend to leverage our competencies and resources to positively impact human health in Greater China and worldwide. We currently have seven commercial programs – ZEJULA, VYVGART / VYVGART Hytrulo, NUZYRA, OPTUNE, QINLOCK, XACDURO, and AUGTYRO – with products that have received marketing approval and that we have commercially launched in one or more territories in Greater China. We also have multiple programs in late-stage product development and a number of ongoing pivotal trials across our portfolio. For more information on our business, products and product candidates, and operations, see 
Business
.
Since our inception, we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from funding our research and development programs and selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. Developing high quality product candidates requires significant investment in our research and development activities over a prolonged period of time, and a core part of our strategy is to continue making sustained investments in this area. Our ability to generate profits and positive cash flow from operations over the next several years depends upon our ability to successfully market our commercial products and to successfully expand the indications for these products and develop and commercialize our other product candidates. As discussed further below, we expect to continue to incur substantial costs related to our research and development and commercialization activities.
As we pursue our corporate strategic goals, we anticipate that our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending in part on the balance between the success of our commercial products and the level of our research and development expenses. We cannot predict whether or when our product candidates will receive regulatory approval. Further, if we receive such regulatory approval, we cannot predict whether or when we may be able to successfully commercialize such products or whether or when such products may become profitable. 
Business Developments and Corporate Strategic Goals
In 2024, we continued to demonstrate strong financial performance, with a 50% increase in total revenue to $399.0 million and a 23% decrease in net loss to $257.1 million compared to the prior year. Our revenue increase was primarily driven by VYVGART, which has steadily increased sales since its strong commercial launch in September 2023 and initial NRDL listing in January 2024, ZEJULA, which continued to lead PARP inhibitor sales for ovarian cancer in the hospital setting, and NUZYRA, which was supported by the inclusion in the NRDL of its IV formulation for the treatment of CABP and/or ABSSSI in January 2023 and its oral formulation for these indications in January 2024. Since the fourth quarter of 2024, we are excited to have expanded our commercial portfolio with the launch in mainland China of VYVGART Hytrulo, the subcutaneous formulation of VYVGART, for gMG and CIDP, XACDURO for HABP and VABP caused by ABC, and AUGTYRO for 
ROS1
+ NSCLC. AUGTYRO was included in the NRDL for this indication in January 2025. In 2025, we expect our revenues to continue to increase for our existing and more recently launched commercial products. 
-78-
We also continued to make progress across our product pipeline. For our global assets, we had promising results from the global Phase I study of ZL-1310, a potential first-in-class and best-in-class DLL3-targeted ADC for the treatment of extensive stage SCLC, and promising pre-clinical data for ZL-1503, our internally developed IL-13/IL-31R bispecific antibody for atopic dermatitis. For our late-stage regional pipeline, we had positive data readouts during the year, including for KarXT in schizophrenia, and we completed enrollment for the second Phase III study of bemarituzumab for the treatment of gastric cancer. We have also expanded and strengthened our global and regional pipelines through synergistic business development activities, including a strategic collaboration and worldwide license agreement with MediLink to use MediLink’s TMALIN ADC platform for the development of ZL-6201, a novel potential first-in-class LRRC15 ADC consisting of an antibody discovered by Zai Lab, for the treatment of certain solid tumors and a strategic collaboration with Vertex for the license of povetacicept, a potential best-in-class treatment for IgAN and other B-cell mediated diseases, in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and Singapore. For more information on our commercial products and product pipeline, including status and developments in 2024, see 
Business – Our Commercial Products and Operations
 and 
Business – Our Pipeline of Product Candidates and R&D Activities
.
We also continued to strengthen our business through key new additions to our global leadership team. For example, after we promoted Dr. Rafael Amado to President, Head of Global Research and Development, expanding his role to encompass our R&D efforts across all of our therapeutic areas in June 2024, we appointed Dr. Prista Charuworn as our Vice President, Immunology, Global R&D to provide strategic leadership and support with respect to the development of our immunology, neuroscience, and infectious disease pipeline.
We further discuss in MD&A below key factors affecting our results of operations, key components and primary drivers of changes in our results of operations in 2024, and our liquidity and capital resources. In 2025, we seek to continue advancing our mission of becoming a leading global biopharmaceutical company, driving innovation in treatment options for patients in China and beyond, by focusing on the following corporate strategic goals: accelerate medicines to patients through our R&D activities; expand and strengthen our global and regional pipelines through our internal discovery efforts and synergistic collaborations and corporate development activities; and continue our commercial excellence and execution, including by delivering strong financial performance as we prepare to launch additional products or new indications for existing products and seek to achieve profitability by the end of 2025. We also intend to continue building and maintaining the trust of our stakeholders by further developing and integrating our Trust for Life strategy into our business and operations.

Basis of Presentation
Our consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and our consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
. Our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
Our Commercial Products
We generate product revenue through the sale of our commercial products in Greater China, net of any related sales returns and rebates to distributors. Our cost of product revenue mainly consists of the costs of manufacturing ZEJULA and NUZYRA, costs of purchasing VYVGART / VYVGART Hytrulo, OPTUNE, QINLOCK, XACDURO, and AUGTYRO from our collaboration partners, any royalty fees incurred as a result of sales of our commercial products under our license and collaboration agreements, and amortization of capitalized post-approval milestone fees incurred under our license and collaboration agreements. We expect our product revenue to increase in coming years as we continue to focus on increasing patient access to our existing commercial products, such as through NRDL listing or increased supplemental 
-79-
insurance coverage in the private-pay market, and as we launch additional commercial products, if and when we obtain required regulatory approvals. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase as the volume of products sold increases.
Research and Development Expenses
We believe our ability to successfully develop product candidates will be the primary factor affecting our long-term competitiveness, as well as our future growth and development. Developing high quality product candidates requires a significant investment of resources over a prolonged period of time. We are committed to advancing and expanding our pipeline of potential best-in-class and first-in-class products, such as through clinical and pre-clinical trials and business development activities. As a result, we expect to continue making significant investments in research and development, including internal discovery activities.
Elements of research and development expenditures primarily include: 
•
payroll and other related costs of personnel engaged in research and development activities; 
•
fees for exclusive development rights of products granted to the Company; 
•
costs related to pre-clinical testing of the Company’s technologies and clinical trials, such as payments to CROs and CMOs, investigators, and clinical trial sites that conduct our clinical studies; and
•
costs to produce the product candidates, including raw materials and supplies, product testing, depreciation, and facility-related expenses.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
Our selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation and related costs, including share-based compensation for commercial and administrative personnel. Other selling, general, and administrative expenses include product distribution and promotion costs, and professional service fees for legal, intellectual property, consulting, auditing, and tax services as well as other direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, and other supplies used in selling, general, and administrative activities. We expect these costs to continue to be significant to support sales of our commercial products and preparation to launch and subsequent sales of additional product candidates if and when approved.
Our Ability to Commercialize Our Product Candidates 
We have multiple product candidates in late-stage clinical development and various others in clinical and pre-clinical development in Greater China and globally. Our ability to generate revenue from our product candidates is dependent on our receipt of regulatory approvals for and successful commercialization of such product candidates, which may not occur. Certain of our product candidates may require additional pre-clinical and/or clinical development, regulatory approvals in multiple jurisdictions, manufacturing supply, and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenue from product sales. 
License and Collaboration Arrangements 
Our results of operations have been, and will continue to be, affected by our license and collaboration agreements. In accordance with these agreements, we may be required to make upfront payments and milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, and sales-based milestones for the relevant products as well as certain royalties at tiered percentage rates based on annual net sales of the licensed products in the licensed territories. As of December 31, 2024, we may in the future be required to pay development and regulatory milestone payments of up to an additional aggregate amount of $211.5 million for our current clinical programs and $766.9 million for other programs. Such development and regulatory milestone payments are contingent on the progress of our product candidates prior to commercialization, and we see these payments as favorable because they indicate that product candidates are advancing. As of December 31, 2024, we also may in the future be required to pay sales-based milestone payments of up to an 
-80-
additional aggregate amount of $2,620.0 million as well as certain royalties at tiered percentage rates on annual net sales. Such sales-based milestone and royalty payments are contingent on the performance of our commercial products, and we see these payments as favorable because they signify that a product is achieving higher sales levels.

Our product revenue is derived from the sales of our commercial products, primarily in mainland China, net of sales returns and rebates to distributors with respect to the sales of these products. 
Our net product revenue increased by $130.9 million in 2024, primarily driven by increased sales for VYVGART since its launch in September 2023 and NRDL listing in January 2024 for the treatment of gMG. Other key drivers of net product revenue growth include increased sales volumes for ZEJULA and NUZYRA in 2024. ZEJULA sales remained strong as it continued to be the leading PARP inhibitor in hospital sales for ovarian cancer in mainland China. The growth in NUZYRA sales was supported by the inclusion in the NRDL for its IV formulation for the treatment of CABP and/or ABSSSI in the first quarter of 2023 and for its oral formulation for these indications in the first quarter of 2024.

Research and development expenses attributable to clinical programs decreased by $26.0 million in 2024 primarily driven by a decrease of $28.7 million in CROs/CMOs/Investigators expenses related to the progress of existing studies, offset by an increase of $2.7 million in licensing fees. Research and development expenses attributable to pre-clinical programs increased by $14.6 million in 2024, primarily driven by an increase of $9.0 million in licensing fees and an increase of $5.6 million in CROs/CMOs/Investigators expenses related to newly initiated studies.
Although we manage our external research and development expenses by program, we do not allocate our internal research and development expenses by program because our employees and internal resources may be engaged in projects for multiple programs at any given time.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $17.1 million in 2024 primarily due to higher general selling expenses and personnel compensation and related costs for VYVGART, which was launched in September 2023, and NUZYRA, which was first included in the NRDL for its IV formulation in January 2023 and for its oral formulation in January 2024. 
Gain on Sale of Intellectual Property
We had a gain on sale of intellectual property of $10.0 million in 2023 in connection with our sale of certain patent rights and related know-how to a third party. We had no such gain or loss in 2024. 
Interest Income
Interest income decreased by $2.7 million in 2024, primarily due to decreased cash and cash equivalents.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased by $2.3 million in 2024, primarily due to interest expense on short-term debt we entered into in 2024. We had no such interest expense in 2023.
Foreign Currency Losses
Foreign currency losses increased by $0.3 million in 2024, primarily driven by increased remeasurement loss due to depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. 
Other Income, Net
Other income, net decreased by $1.7 million in 2024 primarily due to the shift from a gain of $2.8 million in 2023 to a loss of $6.1 million in 2024 for our investment in MacroGenics as a result of changes in its stock price, partially offset by an increase of $5.7 million in government grants.
Income Tax Expense 
Income tax expense was nil in both 2024 and 2023. 
Net Loss 
Net loss was $257.1 million in 2024, or a loss per ordinary share attributable to common stockholders of $0.26 (or loss per ADS of $2.60), compared to a net loss of $334.6 million in 2023, or a loss per ordinary share of $0.35 (or loss per ADS of $3.46). 
-83-
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex. Actual results could differ from our estimates. 
Our most critical accounting policies and estimates, including those that require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and are the most inherently uncertain, are described below. 
Revenue Recognition 
We sell our products to distributors (our customers), who ultimately sell the products to healthcare providers, primarily in mainland China. We recognize revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied upon the product’s delivery to distributors. 
We offer rebates to our distributors to compensate the distributors consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices. We are required to establish a provision for rebates in the same period the related product sales are recognized. The estimated amount of rebates, if any, is recorded as a reduction of revenue.
Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our contracted rates, sales volumes, levels of distributor inventories, and historical experiences and trends. If actual results vary from our estimates or our expectations change, we will adjust these estimates accordingly, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become expected or known. 
Research and Development Expenses 
We have a significant amount of research and development expenses, including with respect to pre-clinical and clinical trials for our product candidates. Such costs are expensed as incurred when they have no alternative future uses. 
We contract with third parties to perform various pre-clinical and clinical trial activities on our behalf in the ongoing development of our product candidates. Expenses related to pre-clinical and clinical trial activities are accrued based on the Company’s estimates of the actual services performed by the third parties, such as CROs and CMOs.
Significant judgments are required in estimating the actual services performed by the third parties for the respective period and the related expense accruals. In determining the appropriate accrual, we consider a variety of factors, including contractual requirements with respect to services to be provided, related rates, and our assessment of services performed during the period and progress with respect to any contractual milestones when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified by third parties of actual costs. If the actual status and timing of services performed vary from our estimates, our reported expenses and earnings for the corresponding period may be affected.  
Share-Based Compensation 
We grant share-based awards, including share options and restricted shares, to eligible employees, non-employees, and directors. Such share-based awards are measured at grant date fair value. 
Significant assumptions are required in determining the fair value of share options, which we estimate using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. These assumptions include: (i) the volatility of our ADS price, (ii) the periods of time over which grantees are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected term), (iii) the expected dividend yield on our ADSs, and (iv) risk-free interest rates. Since we do not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior, the expected term is derived from the average midpoint between the weighted average vesting and the contractual term, also known as the simplified method. The expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future, and risk-free interest rates are based on quoted U.S. Treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the expected term. If actual results vary from our estimates or our expectations change, our reported expenses and earnings for the corresponding period may be affected.
-84-
Income Taxes 
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, which are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant judgements are required when evaluating tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
. 
We recognize in our financial statements the benefit of a tax position if the tax position is “more likely than not” to prevail based on the facts and technical merits of the position. Tax positions that meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement. We estimate our liability for unrecognized tax benefits which are periodically assessed and may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, changes and/or developments with respect to tax audits, and the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The ultimate outcome for a particular tax position may not be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of a tax audit and, in some cases, appeal or litigation process.
We consider positive and negative evidence when determining whether some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment considers various factors, including the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry-forward periods, our historical results of operations, and our tax planning strategies. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Our estimates may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, changes and/or developments with respect to tax audits, and expiration of the statute of limitations. If actual benefits vary from our estimates or our expectations change, we will adjust the recognition and measurement estimates accordingly, which would affect reported expenses and earnings in the corresponding period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
To date, we have financed our activities primarily through private placements, our September 2017 initial public offering and various follow-on offerings on Nasdaq, and our September 2020 secondary listing and initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In addition, we have raised approximately $164.6 million in private equity financing and approximately $2,677.8 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting commissions and the offering expenses payable by us in our initial public offering and subsequent follow-on offerings on Nasdaq and our initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. The net cash used in our operating activities was $214.9 million and $198.2 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. For information on our research and development activities and related expenditures see the

 sections above. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we had commitments for capital expenditures of $6.8 million mainly for the purpose of commercial manufacturing development and facilities construction and improvement activities.
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents, current restricted cash, and short-term investments of $879.7 million, which we expect will enable us to meet our cash requirements including the funding of operating expenses, capital expenditures, and debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. 
Although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, we may, from time to time, identify opportunities to access capital through debt arrangements on favorable commercial terms. In 2024, we entered into four such debt arrangements with Chinese financial institutions that allow certain of our subsidiaries to borrow up to approximately $198.9 million (or RMB1,421.7 million) to support our working capital needs in mainland China. As of December 31, 2024, we had short-term debt of approximately $131.7 million (or RMB946.8 million) pursuant to these debt arrangements. In January 2025, we entered into a working capital loan contract with another Chinese financial institution with respect to a revolving credit facility of up to RMB300.0 million (approximately $41.1 
-85-
million). These debt arrangements will provide us with additional capital capacity that gives us enhanced flexibility to execute on our corporate strategic goals. For more information, see 
Note 12 and Note 22.
We may consider, or we may ultimately need, additional funding sources to bring to fruition our strategic objectives, and there can be no assurances that such funding will be made available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities increased by $16.7 million in 2024, primarily due to a decrease of $77.5 million in net loss and an increase of $13.8 million in adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities, partially offset by a decrease of $108.0 million in net changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $364.4 million in 2024, primarily due to an increase of $196.0 million purchases of short-term investments, a decrease of $101.4 million in proceeds from maturity of short-term investments, an increase of $54.6 million in acquisition of intangible assets, a decrease of $10.0 million in proceeds from sale of intellectual property, and a decrease of $3.9 million in proceeds from land use right, partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in purchases of property and equipment.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 
Net cash provided by financing activities was $349.9 million in 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $6.4 million in 2023. This shift was primarily due to an increase of $216.1 million in proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares upon public offerings net of offering costs, an increase of $131.6 million in proceeds from short-term debt, and a decrease of $8.8 million in taxes paid related to settlement of equity awards.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
We are exposed to market risk including foreign exchange risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk. 
Foreign Exchange Risk 
Renminbi, or RMB, is not a freely convertible currency. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, under the authority of the PBOC, controls the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies. The value of RMB is subject to changes in central government policies and to international economic and political developments affecting supply and demand in the 
-86-
China Foreign Exchange Trading System market. The cash and cash equivalents of the Company included aggregated amounts of $19.0 million and $25.1 million, which were denominated in RMB, representing 4% and 3% of the cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
While our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, our business mainly operates in mainland China with a significant portion of our transactions settled in RMB, and as such, we do not believe that we currently have significant direct foreign exchange risk and have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to such risk. Although, in general, our exposure to foreign exchange risk should be limited, the value of your investment in our ADSs and ordinary shares will be affected by the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB and between the HK dollar and the RMB, respectively, because the value of our business is effectively denominated in RMB, while ADSs and ordinary shares are traded in U.S. dollars and HK dollars, respectively. 
The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in Greater China’s political and economic conditions. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, has been based on rates set by the PBOC. 
The value of our ADSs and our ordinary shares will be affected by the foreign exchange rates between U.S. dollars, HK dollars, and the RMB. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars or HK dollars into RMB for our operations or if any of our arrangements with other parties are denominated in U.S. dollars or HK dollars and need to be converted into RMB, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar or the HK dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert RMB into U.S. dollars or HK dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on ordinary shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar or the HK dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the conversion amounts available to us. 
Since 1983, the HKMA has pegged the HK dollar to the U.S. dollar at the rate of approximately HK$7.80 to US$1.00. However, there is no assurance that the HK dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or that the HK dollar conversion rate will remain at HK$7.80 to US$1.00. If the HK dollar conversion rate against the U.S. dollar changes and the value of the HK dollar depreciates against the U.S. dollar, our assets denominated in HK dollars will be adversely affected. Additionally, if the HKMA were to repeg the HK dollar to, for example, the RMB rather than the U.S. dollar, or otherwise restrict the conversion of HK dollars into other currencies, then our assets denominated in HK dollars will be adversely affected.
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that are potentially subject to significant concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes receivable. 
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments represent the maximum amount of losses due to credit risk. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $449.7 million and $790.2 million, restricted cash of $101.1 million and $1.1 million, and short-term investments of $330.0 million and $16.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, all of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments were held by major financial institutions located in mainland China and international financial institutions outside of mainland China which we believe are of high credit quality and for which we monitor continued credit worthiness. 
Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from product revenue. We manage credit risk related to our accounts receivable through ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances and limiting the amount of credit extended based upon payment history and credit worthiness. Historically, we have collected receivables from customers within the credit terms with no significant credit losses incurred. As of December 31, 2024, our two largest customers accounted for approximately 23% of our total accounts receivable collectively. 
Certain accounts receivable balances are settled in the form of notes receivable. As of December 31, 2024, such notes receivable included bank acceptance promissory notes that are non-interest bearing and due within six months. These 
-87-
notes receivable were used to collect the receivables based on an administrative convenience, given these notes are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. In accordance with the sales agreements, whether to use cash or bank acceptance promissory notes to settle the receivables is at our discretion, and this selection does not impact the agreed contractual purchase prices. 
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $449.7 million and $790.2 million, restricted cash of $101.1 million and $1.1 million, and short-term investments of $330.0 million and $16.3 million, respectively. Our investment portfolio, which relates to cash equivalents and short-term investments, primarily consists of time deposits. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal, provide liquidity, and maximize income without significantly increasing risk. Given the short‑term nature of our deposits and investments, we believe that a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition and/or results of operation. For example, a hypothetical 10% relative change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have a material impact on future interest income.
We are also exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates on our short-term debt, which is currently subject to a mix of fixed and floating interest rates. We had $131.7 million of short-term debt as of December 31, 2024. A 100-basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2024 would not materially increase our interest expense. Our interest rate exposure from short-term debt is also offset by our exposure in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments, as discussed above. For more information on our short-term debt, see

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
(a)    Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or furnish under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective. Based upon that evaluation, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
(b)    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of 
-88-
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).” Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
(c)    Report of Registered Accounting Firm
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who has also audited our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, as stated in their report which is included in 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
.
(d)    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such item is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Zai Lab Limited
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Zai Lab Limited and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement Schedule I - Condensed Financial Information of Registrant (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
F-2
Evaluation of accrued preclinical and clinical trial expenses
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s research and development expenses include costs associated with payments to contract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for various preclinical and clinical trial activities. Expenses related to preclinical and clinical trial activities are accrued based on the Company’s estimates of the actual services performed by the CROs and CMOs. As disclosed in the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $100.9 million in accounts payable which included the accrued preclinical and clinical trial expenses.
We identified the evaluation of accrued preclinical and clinical trial expenses as a critical audit matter. Specifically, evaluating the estimate of services performed for certain research and development activities at year-end required subjective auditor judgment. 
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to accrued preclinical and clinical trial expenses. This included controls related to the estimation of the services performed by the CROs and CMOs during the period that are included in accounts payable balances at the end of each reporting period. On a sample basis, we examined contracts, purchase orders, invoices, and third-party confirmations and compared them to the Company’s estimation of services performed by the CROs and CMOs. We also examined certain invoices received and/or payments made after year-end and evaluated whether they were associated with services received prior to that date and whether they were included in the Company’s estimate of costs incurred at year-end.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Zai Lab Limited
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Zai Lab Limited and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement Schedule I - Condensed Financial Information of Registrant (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
2.    
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(a) 
Basis of Presentation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements are summarized below.

(b) 
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Zai Lab Limited and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.
(c) 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, accrual of rebates, recognition of research and development expenses based on the Company’s estimates of the actual services performed by the CROs and CMOs, fair value of share-based compensation expenses, recoverability of deferred tax assets, and useful life of intangible assets for commercial products. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

(d) 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The functional currency of Zai Lab Limited, Zai Lab (Hong Kong) Limited, Zai Lab (US) LLC, and Zai Auto Immune (Hong Kong) Limited are the U.S. dollar (“$”). The Company’s subsidiaries in mainland China determined their functional currency to be the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”). The Company’s subsidiary in Australia determined its functional currency to be the Australian dollar (“A$”). The Company’s subsidiary in Taiwan determined its functional currency to be the Taiwan dollar (“TWD”). The determination of the respective functional currency is based on the criteria of Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 830, 
Foreign Currency Matters
. The Company uses the U.S. dollar as its reporting currency. 
Assets and liabilities are translated from each entity’s functional currency to the reporting currency at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Equity amounts are translated at historical exchange rates. Revenues, expenses, gains, and losses are translated using the average rate for the period presented. The resulted foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, and the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currencies are translated into the functional currencies at the prevailing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the applicable functional currencies at historical exchange rates. Transactions in currencies other than the applicable functional currencies during the year are converted into the functional currencies at the applicable rates of exchange prevailing at the transaction dates. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.

Zai Lab Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
(e) 
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on hand, demand deposits, and highly liquid investments with maturity of less than three months and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. 
Restricted Cash 
Restricted cash mainly consists of bank deposits held as collateral for issuances of letters of credit for the Company’s loan facility (see 
Note 12
).
(f) 
Short-Term Investments 
Short-term investments are time deposits with original maturities between three months and one year. Short-term investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Interest earned is included in interest income.

(g) 
Accounts Receivable 
The Company’s accounts receivable arise from product sales and represent amounts due from its customers. From January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the ASU 2016-13, 
Credit Losses, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. 
Accounts receivable are recorded at the amounts net of allowances for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the receivables. The Company considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for credit losses including the aging of receivables and aging trends, customer creditworthiness, and specific exposures related to particular customers. The Company also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country-specific risks and economic factors that may affect a debtor’s ability to pay in establishing and adjusting its allowance for credit losses. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible.
(h) 
Notes Receivable 
Notes receivable are equal to contractual amounts owed from signed, secured promissory notes issued from customers to the Company. The Company considers the notes receivable to be fully collectible.
 Accordingly, 
no
 allowance for credit loss has been established as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.   
(i) 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted average basis. The Company periodically reviews the composition of inventory and shelf life of inventory to identify obsolete, slow-moving, or otherwise non-saleable items. The Company will record a write-down to its net realizable value in cost of product revenue in the period that the decline in value is first identified.

Zai Lab Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
(j) 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:
Useful life
Office equipment
3
 years
Electronic equipment
1.25
-
3
 years
Vehicles
4
 years
Laboratory equipment
5
 years
Manufacturing equipment
10
 years
Leasehold improvements
lesser of useful life or lease term
Construction in progress represents property and equipment under construction and pending installation and is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any.

(k) 
Leases
The Company leases facilities for its offices, research and development center, and manufacturing facilities in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the United States. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the ASC 842, 
Leases
 (“
ASC 842
”), using the modified retrospective transition approach by applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application and not restating historical periods before the adoption date. 
The Company assessed whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. The Company’s leases are all classified as operating leases with fixed lease payments, or minimum payments, as contractually stated in the lease agreements. The Company’s leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease liabilities that become due within one year of the balance sheet date are classified as current operating lease liabilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
At the commencement date of a lease, the Company recognizes a lease liability for future fixed lease payments and a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured as the present value of the future fixed lease payments that will be made over the lease term. The lease term includes periods for which the Company is reasonably certain that the renewal options will be exercised and the termination options will not be exercised. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities as the Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. The incremental borrowing rate is reevaluated upon a lease modification. The Company considered information available at the adoption date of ASC 842 to determine the incremental borrowing rate for leases in existence as of this date.
The ROU asset is measured at the amount of the lease liability with adjustments, if applicable, for lease prepayments made prior to or at lease commencement, initial direct costs incurred by the Company, and lease incentives. Under ASC 842, land use rights agreements are also considered to be operating lease contracts.
The Company elected to apply each of the practical expedients described in ASC 842 which allow companies (i) not to reassess prior conclusions on whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain a lease, lease classification, and initial direct costs upon adoption of ASC 842, (ii) combine lease and non-lease components for all underlying assets

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
groups, and (iii) not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for short term leases. A short-term lease is a lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.
(l) 
Land Use Rights 
All land in mainland China is subject to government or collective ownership. Land use rights can be purchased for a specified period of time. The purchase price of land use rights represents the operating lease prepayments under ASC 842 and is recorded as land use rights on the consolidated balance sheet, which is amortized over the remaining lease term.
The Company acquired land use rights in 2019 for a term of 
30
 years from the local Bureau of Land and Resources in Suzhou for the purpose of constructing and operating a research center and biologics manufacturing facility in Suzhou. In 2023, the Company returned a portion of the land use rights and received cash in an amount equal to the respective portion of the original acquisition cost.
(m) 
Long-Term Deposits 
Long-term deposits represent amounts paid in connection with the Company’s long-term lease agreements.

(n)  
Intangible Assets 
Intangible assets for commercial products include capitalized post-approval milestone fees and acquired commercial manufacturing know-how and related development costs. The Company is amortizing intangible assets for commercial products as cost of product revenue over the estimated remaining useful life of the related products, which is generally based on expected patent life, the contractual period of the underlying license agreement, and expected commercial benefits of the products. Intangible assets for externally purchased software are amortized over 
three
 to 
five years
 on a straight-line basis.

(o) 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company evaluates long-lived assets, which includes intangible assets, tangible assets, and ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the related asset group to its future undiscounted cash flows. The Company measures the amount of impairment, if any, based on the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the impaired asset group.

(p) 
Fair Value Measurements 
The Company applies ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
, in measuring fair value (“
ASC 820
”). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires disclosures to be provided on fair value measurement. 
ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 
Level 1 — Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 — Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace. 
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. 
F-14
Zai Lab Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
ASC 820 describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: (i) market approach; (ii) income approach; and (iii) cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount. The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset. 
Equity investments with readily determinable fair value are measured using level 1 inputs and were $
3.1
 million and $
9.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The unrealized gains and losses from fair value changes are recognized in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. 
Financial instruments of the Company primarily include cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, notes receivable, prepayments, and other current assets, accounts payable, and other current liabilities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, prepayments, and other current assets, accounts payable, short-term debt, and other current liabilities approximated their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments, and the carrying value of notes receivable and restricted cash approximated their fair value based on the nature of the assessment of the ability to recover these amounts.

(q) 
Revenue Recognition
In 2018, the Company adopted ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(“
ASC 606
”). Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration, if any; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations it must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each performance obligation when that performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied.
The Company’s revenue is mainly from product sales. The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the Company has satisfied the performance obligation by transferring control of the product to the customers. Control of the product generally transfers to the customers when the delivery is made and when title and risk of loss transfers to the consumers. Cost of product revenue mainly consists of the acquisition cost of products, the manufacturing cost of products, royalty fees, and amortization of intangible assets for commercial products. 
The Company has applied the practical expedients under ASC 606 with regard to assessment of the financing component and concluded that there is no significant financing component given that the period between delivery of goods and payment is generally one year or less. 
In mainland China, the Company sells these products to distributors, who ultimately sell the products to health care providers. Based on the nature of the arrangements, the performance obligations are satisfied upon the delivery of the products to distributors. Rebates are offered to distributors, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices. The 
F-15
Zai Lab Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates, if any, are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Estimated rebates are determined based on contracted rates and sales volumes and to a lesser extent, distributor inventories. The Company regularly reviews the information related to these estimates and adjusts the amount accordingly. 
In Hong Kong, the Company sells the products to customers, which are typically healthcare providers such as oncology centers. The Company utilizes a third party for warehousing services. Based on the nature of the arrangements, the Company has determined that it is a principal in the transaction since the Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the products to the customers, maintains inventory risk until delivery to the customers, and has latitude in establishing the price. Revenue is recognized upon delivery to customers at mutually agreed upon prices. Consideration paid to the third party is recognized in operating expenses.

The Company did not recognize any contract assets or contract liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(r) 
Collaborative Arrangements 
The Company analyzes its collaboration arrangements to assess whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities and therefore within the scope of ASC Topic 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements
 (“
ASC 808
”). This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. 
For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, the Company first determines which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and which elements of the collaboration are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606. For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently.

(s) 
Research and Development Expenses 
Elements of research and development expenses primarily include (i) payroll and other related costs of personnel engaged in research and development activities; (ii) in-licensed patent rights fees for exclusive development rights for products granted to the Company; (iii) costs related to pre-clinical testing of the Company’s technologies under development and clinical trials such as payments to CROs and CMOs, investigators, and clinical trial sites that conduct its clinical studies; (iv) costs to develop the product candidates, including raw materials and supplies, product testing, depreciation, and facility-related expenses; and (v) other research and development expenses. Research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred when they have no alternative future uses. Liabilities related to third-party research and development expenses are primarily included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet.
The Company has acquired rights to develop and commercialize certain product candidates. Upfront payments that relate to the acquisition of a new product compound, as well as pre-commercial milestone payments, are immediately expensed as acquired in-process research and development in the period in which they are incurred, provided that the new product compound does not also include processes or activities that would constitute a “business” as defined under U.S. GAAP. Milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval which meet the capitalization criteria would be capitalized as intangible assets and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the related product, which is generally based on expected patent life, the contractual period of the underlying license agreement, and expected commercial benefits of the products.

(t) 
Deferred Income 
Deferred income is mainly related to upfront payments received from collaborative partners and government grants.
The Company received certain upfront payments from collaborative partners, which are being amortized over the terms of the contracts. The Company had $
30.7
 million and $
26.7
 million in deferred income related to the upfront payments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Government grants consist of cash subsidies received by the Company’s subsidiaries in mainland China from local governments for conducting business in certain local districts. Grant received before the fulfillment of government specified performance obligations is recorded into deferred income. When the performance obligations are satisfied, the Company records the grants into other income, net. The Company had $
0.7
 million and $
2.1
 million of deferred income related to government grants as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

(u) 
Share-Based Compensation 
The Company grants share options and non-vested restricted shares to eligible employees, non-employees, and directors and accounts for these share-based awards in accordance with ASC 718, 
Compensation-Stock Compensation (“
ASC 718
”)
.
The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant-date fair value of non-vested restricted shares is the market value of the underlying stock on the award’s grant date. 
 The Company has elected to use the straight-line method to recognize compensation expenses for share awards with graded vesting based on service conditions, provided that the minimum amount of cumulative compensation expense recognized is not less than the portion of the award vested to date. For share-based awards with service conditions only, the Company recognizes expenses (i) immediately at grant date if no vesting conditions are required; or (ii) using a straight-line method over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period, if vesting conditions are required. For share-based awards containing performance conditions, the Company recognizes expenses based on the estimated number of performance-based awards expected to vest using the graded vesting attribution method. The Company accounts for the effect of forfeitures as they occur.
(v) 
Income Taxes 
Income tax expense includes (i) deferred tax expense, which generally represents the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability balance during the year plus any change in valuation allowances; (ii) current tax expense, which represents the amount of tax currently payable to or receivable from a taxing authority; and (iii) non-current tax expense, which represents the increases and decreases in amounts related to uncertain tax positions from prior periods and not settled with cash or other tax attributes.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, which are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
The Company evaluates its uncertain tax positions using the provisions of ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
, which requires that realization of an uncertain income tax position be recognized in the financial statements. The benefit to be recorded in the financial statements is the amount most likely to be realized assuming a review by tax authorities having all relevant 
F-17

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
information and applying current conventions. It is the Company’s policy to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of income tax expense.

(w) 
Loss Per Share 
Basic loss per ordinary share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. 
Diluted loss per ordinary share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into ordinary shares. The Company had stock options and non-vested restricted shares, which could potentially dilute basic loss per share in the future. To calculate the number of shares for diluted loss per share, the effect of the stock options and non-vested restricted shares is computed using the treasury stock method. The computation of diluted loss per share does not assume exercise or conversion of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect.

(x) 
Comprehensive Loss 
Comprehensive loss is defined as the changes in equity of the Company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. For each of the periods presented, the Company’s comprehensive loss includes net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments, which are presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

(y) Concentration of Risks
Concentration of Customers 
In 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company’s five largest customers accounted for approximately $
128.7
 million (
32.4
%), $
104.7
 million (
35.0
%), and $
88.2
 million (
37.7
%) of the product revenue, respectively. One customer accounted for approximately $
67.3
 million (
16.9
%),  $
59.4
 million (
19.9
%), and $
52.5
  million (
22.4
%) of the product revenue, respectively for the same periods. 
Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that are potentially subject to significant concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and notes receivable. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by major financial institutions located in mainland China and international financial institutions outside of mainland China which management believes are of high credit quality and continually monitors the credit worthiness of these financial institutions.
Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from product sales. The Company manages credit risk of accounts receivable through ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances and limits the amount of credit extended based upon payment history and credit worthiness. Historically, the Company has collected receivables from customers within the credit terms with no significant credit losses incurred. 
One customer accounted for 10% or more of accounts receivable, with $
16.7
 million and $
7.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  
Certain accounts receivable balances may be settled in the form of notes receivable. As of December 31, 2024, notes receivable represented bank acceptance promissory notes that are non-interest bearing and due within six months. Notes receivable were used to collect the receivables based on an administrative convenience, given these notes are readily convertible to be known amounts of cash. In accordance with the sales agreements, whether to use cash or bank acceptance 
F-18
Zai Lab Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
promissory notes to settle the receivables is at the Company’s discretion, and this selection does not impact the agreed contractual purchase prices. 
The Company’s other receivables were primarily due from its partners, which have good credit ratings. The credit risk for other receivables was generally very low. 
Foreign Currency Risk 
RMB is not a freely convertible currency. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, under the authority of the People’s Bank of China, controls the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies. The value of RMB is subject to changes in central government policies and to international economic and political developments affecting supply and demand in the China Foreign Exchange Trading System market.
 The cash and cash equivalents of the Company included aggregated amounts denominated in RMB of $
19.0
 million and $
25.1
 million, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing 
4
% and 
3
% of the cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

ASC 740,
 Income Taxes,
 provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not. The Company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on its ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carry forward periods provided for in the tax law. In assessing the need for any additional valuation allowance for 2024, the Company considered all available evidence both positive and negative, including potential for prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, recent losses, and forecasts of future profitability. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company determined that the deferred tax assets on temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards related to certain subsidiaries will not be realized, and as such it has fully provided the corresponding valuation allowance.
The following table presents that movement of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets ($ in thousands):

(

(

)
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $
1,951.5
 million and $
1,804.9
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, net operating losses were primarily comprised of: $
1,497.0
 million derived from a certain entity in mainland China which expires in years 2025 through 2034;  $
83.6
 million derived from other entities in mainland China which expire in years 2025 through 2029; $
2.5
 million derived from Taiwan which expires in years 2025 through 2034; and $
57.7
 million, $
306.9
 million, and $
3.8
 million derived from Hong Kong, the United States, and Australia, respectively, that have indefinite carryforwards. Net operating loss carryforwards in mainland China and Taiwan expire through 2034 and those in Hong Kong, the United States, and Australia do not expire.
Uncertainties exist with respect to how the current income tax law in mainland China applies to the Company’s overall operations, and more specifically, with regard to tax residency status. The EIT Law includes a provision specifying 
F-26
Zai Lab Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
that legal entities organized outside of mainland China will be considered residents for Chinese income tax purposes if the place of effective management or control is within mainland China. The implementation rules to the EIT Law provide that non-resident legal entities will be considered Chinese residents if substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, and properties occurs within mainland China. Despite the present uncertainties resulting from the limited Chinese tax guidance on the issue, the Company does not believe that the legal entities organized outside of mainland China within the Company should be treated as residents for EIT Law purposes. If the Chinese tax authorities subsequently determine that the Company and its subsidiaries registered outside of mainland China should be deemed resident enterprises, the Company and its subsidiaries registered outside of mainland China will be subject to Chinese income taxes, at a rate of 25%. The Company is not subject to any other uncertain tax position. 
According to the PRC Tax Administration and Collection Law, the statute of limitation is three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to computational errors made by the taxpayer or the withholding agent. The statute of limitation is extended to five years under special circumstances where the underpayment of taxes is more than RMB0.1 million. In the case of transfer pricing issues, the statute of limitation is 10 years. There is no statute of limitation in the case of tax evasion. The income tax returns of the Company’s PRC subsidiary for the years from 2015 to 2024 are open to examination by the PRC tax authorities.
For Hong Kong income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is six years after the relevant year of assessment. This can be extended to 10 years in the case of fraud or willful evasion of taxes. There are no provisions that govern the time limit for tax collection.
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is generally 3 years after the due date of the return, or 3 years after the date the return was actually filed, whichever is later. The statute of limitations does not apply to fraud or tax evasion. Also, the statute of limitations is indefinite if no tax return is filed. For state income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is generally 4 years from the return filing date or due date in states including California, Kentucky, and New Jersey, subject to certain exceptions (e.g., fraud, failure to file).

Share-Based Compensation 
The Company has adopted equity incentive plans, pursuant to which the Company grants share options, SARs, restricted and unrestricted shares, and share units, performance awards, and other awards that are convertible into or otherwise based on ordinary shares to employees and directors of the Company as well as to certain advisors and service providers. In March 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company approved such an Equity Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”). In August 2017, in connection with the completion of the Company’s initial public offering on Nasdaq (the “IPO”), 
F-29
Zai Lab Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
the Board of Directors approved the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”). No new equity-based awards would be granted under the 2015 Plan subsequent to the IPO; new equity-based awards would be granted under the 2017 Plan. 
The Company adopted the 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”), which became effective in June 2022 following required approvals from the Company’s shareholders and Board of Directors. No new equity-based awards will be made under the 2017 Plan as of the effective date of the 2022 Plan. The initial aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the 2022 Plan was 
97,908,743
 ordinary shares.
The Company adopted the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2024 Plan”), which became effective in June 2024 following required approvals from the Company’s shareholders and Board of Directors. No new equity-based awards will be made under the 2022 Plan as of the effective date of the 2024 Plan. The initial aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the 2024 Plan was 
99,208,743

ordinary shares. 
The share options granted under the equity incentive plans described above have a contractual term of 
ten years
. Share options granted since April 2023 generally vest ratably over a 
four-year
 period, and share options granted prior to April 2023 generally vest ratably over a 
five-year
 period, with 
25
% or 
20
% of the awards vesting on each anniversary of the grant date, respectively, subject to continued employment/service with the Company on the vesting date. The restricted shares granted generally vest ratably over a specified period on the anniversary of the grant date, subject to continued employment/service with the Company on the vesting date. The shares underlying restricted share grants represent shares not yet vested until they have met related consideration or vesting requirements, which are generally continued employment/service to the Company or satisfaction of specified performance conditions. The restricted shares will be released from the restrictions once they vest. Upon termination of the award holders’ service with the Company for any reason, any shares that are outstanding and not yet vested will be immediately forfeited unless otherwise determined by the administrator or set forth in an agreement between the Company and the award holder.
Before November 2023, upon each settlement date of the share awards, shares were generally withheld to cover the required withholding tax, which was based on the value of a share on the settlement date as determined by the closing price of the ADSs on the trading day of the applicable settlement date. The remaining shares after the withholding were delivered to the recipient. The amount remitted to the tax authorities for employee tax obligations was reflected as a financing activity on the consolidated statements of cash flows. These shares withheld by the Company as a result of the net settlement were accounted for as treasury stock and considered issued but not outstanding.

License and Collaboration Agreements 
The Company may enter into collaboration agreements with third parties to license intellectual property. These agreements may require the Company to make upfront payments and payments related to certain future development, regulatory, and sales-based milestones as well as certain royalties at tiered percentage rates on annual sales of the licensed products in the licensed territory. These agreements generally remain in effect, unless earlier terminated, until the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the last licensed product. The royalty terms generally continue until the latest of: (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim with respect to licensed patent rights; (ii) the expiration of market or regulatory exclusivity; or (iii) a specified period of time, generally around 
ten years
, after the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product. These agreements also contain customary provisions for termination by either party, including in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured; by the Company for convenience upon a specified notice period; for certain bankruptcy, insolvency, or other similar events; and by its partners upon challenge of their licensed patent rights. 
Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon the achievement of such milestones or sales. These commitments are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet because the achievement and timing of these milestones are not fixed and determinable. The following is a description of the Company’s significant license and collaboration agreements as of December 31, 2024, including milestone fees incurred in 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Restricted Net Assets
The Company’s ability to pay dividends may depend on the Company receiving distributions of funds from its Chinese subsidiaries. Relevant Chinese laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by the Company’s Chinese subsidiaries only out of its retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. The results of operations reflected in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP differ from those reflected in the statutory financial statements of the Company’s Chinese subsidiaries.  
In accordance with the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China, a domestic enterprise is required to provide statutory reserves of at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit until such reserve has reached 50% of its respective 
F-35
Zai Lab Limited
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
registered capital based on the enterprise’s Chinese statutory accounts. A domestic enterprise may provide discretionary surplus reserve, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, from the profits determined in accordance with the enterprise’s Chinese statutory accounts. The aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. The Company’s Chinese subsidiaries were established as domestic enterprises and therefore are subject to the above-mentioned restrictions on distributable profits. 
No
 appropriation to statutory reserves was made in 2024, 2023, and 2022 because the Chinese subsidiaries had substantial losses during such periods. 
As a result of these Chinese laws and regulations, subject to the limits discussed above that require annual appropriations of 10% of after-tax profit to be set aside, prior to payment of dividends, as a general reserve fund, the Company’s Chinese subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer out a portion of their net assets. 
Foreign exchange and other regulation in mainland China may further restrict the Company’s subsidiaries in mainland China from transferring out funds in the form of dividends, loans, and advances. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, amounts restricted included the paid-in capital of the Company’s subsidiaries in mainland China and were $
506.0
 million.

19.    
Employee Defined Contribution Plans
Full-time employees of the Company in mainland China participate in a government mandated defined contribution plan, pursuant to which certain pension benefits, medical care, employee housing fund, and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. Chinese labor regulations require that the Company’s subsidiaries in mainland China make contributions to the government for these benefits primarily based on certain percentages of the employees’ salaries subject to certain caps and other government requirements. The total amounts for such employee benefits, which were expensed as incurred, were $
26.0
 million, $
25.8
 million, and $
23.6
 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
The Company’s employees who are U.S. taxpayers and who meet certain age and service requirements are eligible to participate in a broad-based, defined contribution retirement plan which is qualified under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “401(k) plan”). The Company makes a matching contribution equal to 
100
% in 2024 and 2023 and 
50
% in 2022 of the first 
5
% of the employee’s elective contributions under the plan, up to 
5.0
% of an employee’s eligible compensation. Contributions made by the Company vest 
100
% upon contribution. The total amounts for such employee benefits, which were expensed as incurred, were $
1.1
 million, $
1.0
 million, and $
0.5
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 
The Company also provides required Mandatory Provident Fund contribution for its full-time employees located in Hong Kong and provides social benefits contribution for its full-time employees located in Taiwan. The total amounts for these contributions, which were expensed as incurred, was $
0.2
 million in each of 2024, 2023, and 2022. 
There is no forfeiture of contribution related to any of the Company’s employee defined contribution plans as described above.

Commitments and Contingencies
(a)    Purchase Commitments
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s commitments related to commercial manufacturing development and facilities construction and improvement activities that are contracted but not yet reflected in the consolidated financial statements were $
6.8
 million and were expected to be incurred within one year. 
(b)    Legal Proceedings
The Company is not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. Each quarter, the Company evaluates whether there have been any developments in legal proceedings that would require an accrual. In accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies, the Company will accrue for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. The Company will record any legal and other third-party costs related to its legal contingencies as incurred.
(c)       Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements that indemnify others for certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or certain events and activities. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, the Company may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. The Company’s exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future but have not yet been made. To date, the Company has not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to its indemnification obligations.

Subsequent Events 
In January 2025, the Company identified an additional opportunity to access capital denominated in RMB through a debt facility with Bank of Communications on favorable commercial terms to support its working capital needs in mainland China. As a result, on January 2, 2025, the Company entered into a guarantee contract with Bank of Communications Co., Ltd. Shanghai Zhangjiang Sub-Branch (“BOCOM”) pursuant to which the Company will guarantee working capital loans from BOCOM to Zai Lab Shanghai, and Zai Lab Shanghai entered into a working capital loan contract with BOCOM with respect to a revolving credit facility of up to RMB
300.0
 million (approximately $
41.1
 million), of which the full amount was subsequently withdrawn by Zai Lab Shanghai in February 2025. The working capital loan has a 
one-year
 term and is subject to a floating interest rate, which is subject to adjustment every three months.
In February 2025, upon the maturity of a portion of the short-term debt with BOC Pudong Branch (
see Note 12
), Zai Lab Shanghai repaid RMB
340.0
 million (approximately $
46.9
 million) of the loan balance.

Schedule I — Condensed Financial Information of Registrant
Zai Lab Limited 
Financial Information of Parent Company
Notes 
1.    Schedule I has been provided pursuant to the requirements of Rule 12-04(a) and 5-04(c) of Regulation S-X, which require condensed financial information as to the financial position, changes in financial position and results of operations of a parent company as of the same dates and for the same periods for which audited consolidated financial statements have been presented when the restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries exceed 25 percent of consolidated net assets as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year. 
2.    The condensed financial information has been prepared using the same accounting policies as set out in the consolidated financial statements except that the equity method has been used to account for investments in its subsidiaries. For the parent company, Zai Lab Limited records its investments in subsidiaries under the equity method of accounting as prescribed in ASC 323, 
Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures
. Such investments are presented on the Condensed Balance Sheets as “Investment in subsidiaries”. Ordinarily under the equity, an investor in an equity method investee would cease to recognize its share of the losses of an investee once the carrying value of the investment has been reduced to nil absent an undertaking by the investor to provide continuing support and fund losses. For the purpose of this Schedule I, the parent company has continued to reflect its share, based on its proportionate interest, of the losses of subsidiaries regardless of the carrying value of the investment even though the parent company is not obligated to provide continuing support or fund losses. 
3.    Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The footnote disclosures provide certain supplemental information relating to the operations of the Company and, as such, these statements should be read in conjunction with the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
4.    As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material contingencies, significant provisions of long-term obligations, mandatory dividend or redemption requirements of redeemable stocks or guarantees of Zai Lab Limited.
