Overview
We are a leading full-line sporting goods and outdoor recreation retailer in the United States.  Our mission is to provide “Fun for All” and we fulfill this mission with a localized merchandising strategy and value proposition that deeply connect with a broad range of consumers.  Our product assortment focuses on key categories of outdoors, apparel, sports & recreation and footwear (representing 30%, 27%, 23% and 20% of our 2024 net sales, respectively) through both leading national brands and a portfolio of private label brands, which go well beyond traditional sporting goods and apparel offerings.
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.  A significant portion of our net sales and profits is driven by summer holidays, such as Memorial Day, Father’s Day and Independence Day, during the second quarter.  Our net sales and profits are also impacted by the August/September back-to-school selling season during the third quarter, the November/December holiday selling season, and in part by the sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel during the fourth quarter.
As of February 1, 2025, we operat
ed 298 sto
res that range in size from approximately
 40,000 to 130,000 gross
 square feet, with an average size of approxima
tely 70,000 gro
ss square feet, through
out 19 cont
iguous states located primarily in the southern United States.  Our stores are supported by approxi
mately 22,000 team 
members, three distribution centers, and our e-commerce platform, which includes our website at www.academy.com and our mobile app.  Additionally, we are deepening our customer relationships, further integrating our e-commerce platform with our stores and driving operating efficiencies by developing our omnichannel capabilities, such as our mobile app, optimizing the website experience and upgrading our fulfillment capabilities.

How We Assess the Performance of Our Business and Recent Trends
Our management considers a number of financial and operating metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, determine the allocation of resources, make decisions regarding corporate strategies and evaluate projections.  These metrics include operational measures and non-GAAP metrics supplemental to our GAAP results.
Comparable Sales.  
We define comparable sales as the percentage of period-over-period net sales increase or decrease, in the aggregate, for stores open after thirteen full fiscal months, as well as for all e-commerce sales.  There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable sales.  As a result, data in this Annual Report regarding our comparable sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by other retailers.  Stores which have been significantly remodeled or relocated are removed from this calculation until the new store has been in operation for substantially all of the periods being compared.  Stores which have been closed for an extended period of time due to circumstances beyond our control are also removed from the calculation.  Any sales made through our website or mobile app are allocated to e-commerce sales for the purpose of measuring comparable sales, regardless of how those sales are fulfilled, whether shipped to home or picked up in-store or curbside through our buy-online-pickup-in-store program (“BOPIS”).  For example, all BOPIS transactions, which are originated by our website, are allocated to e-commerce sales for the purpose of comparable sales, despite the fact that our customers pick-up these purchases from a specific store.  
Increases or decreases in e-commerce between periods being compared directly impact the comparable sales results.  Various other factors affect comparable sales, including consumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends; our ability to identify and respond effectively to customer preferences and local and regional trends; our ability to provide an assortment of high quality/value oriented product offerings that generate new and repeat visits to our stores and our website; the customer experience and unique services we provide in our stores; our ability to execute our omnichannel strategy, including the growth of our e-commerce business; changes in product mix and pricing, including promotional activities; the number of items purchased per visit and average order value; a shift in the timing of a holiday between comparable periods; and the number of stores that have been in operation for more than thirteen months.  
The comparable sales metric for 2024 (52 week fiscal year) compares the fiscal year ending February 1, 2025 to the final 52 weeks of the fiscal year 2023 ended February 3, 2024. Fiscal year 2023 was a 53 week year.  Merchandise net sales for the 2023 53rd week were $73.3 million.
Transactions and average ticket.
 We define transactions as the number of customer transactions for stores and e-commerce during a given period on a comparable sales basis.  Transactions are influenced by customer traffic, the amount of customers that visited our stores or website, and sales conversion, the percent of those customers that made a purchase.  We define average ticket as total sales divided by the number of transactions during a given period, which tells us the average amount the customer is spending on a purchase.
46
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per Share and Adjusted Free Cash Flow.  
Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per Share and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.  Management also uses Adjusted EBIT as a performance target to establish and award discretionary annual incentive compensation.  See “Non-GAAP Measures” below.
Components of Our Results of Operations.  
Our profitability is primarily influenced by fluctuations in net sales, gross margin and our ability to leverage selling, general and administrative expenses.
Net Sales
.  
Net sales are derived from in-store and e-commerce merchandise sales, net of sales tax and an allowance for merchandise returns.
Net sales fluctuations can be driven by new store openings, comparable sales increases or decreases including e-commerce sales, our ability to adjust inventory based on sales fluctuations, our management of vendor relations and meeting customer demand, allowances and logistics, seasonality, unseasonal or extreme weather, changes in consumer shopping preferences, consumer discretionary spending, and market and sales promotions.
We must maintain sufficient inventory levels of merchandise that our customers desire to successfully operate our business.  A shortage of popular merchandise could reduce our net sales.  Conversely, we also must seek to avoid accumulating excess inventory to avoid markdowns and clearance, which negatively impact sales and gross margin.  We have deployed several new tools over recent years to improve inventory handling and vendor management, including third-party programs to analyze our inventory stock and execute a disciplined markdown strategy throughout the year at every location. This implementation, along with other factors, has allowed us to improve our inventory management in stores over the past few years.  We have coupled these tools with the data we have been able to collect from our Academy Credit Card program, our customer database and targeted customer surveys, so that we can better estimate future inventory requirements.  It is imperative that we continue to find innovative ways to strengthen our inventory management if we are to remain competitive and expand our margins on a go-forward basis.
Our broad assortment gives us an advantage over mass general merchants who typically do not carry the leading national brands sold at Academy.

We have also continued to add private label brand products to our assortment of products, which we generally price lower than the national brand products of comparable quality that we also offer.

A shift in our sales mix in which we sell more units of our private label brand products and fewer units of the national brand products would generally have a positive impact on our gross margin but an adverse impact on our total net sales.  
Furthermore, our softgoods merchandise divisions, which consist of apparel and footwear, have higher margins than our hardgoods merchandise divisions, which consist of outdoors and sports and recreation.  A shift in sales mix toward softgoods would generally have a positive impact on gross margin and a shift in sales mix towards hardgoods would generally have a negative impact on gross margin.
The expansion and enhancement of our omnichannel capabilities has resulted in increased sales in recent years.  We continue to invest in initiatives that will increase traffic to our stores and e-commerce platform, which includes our website and mobile app, and drive increased sales conversion.  These initiatives include investments in our new customer data platform and the development of strategies, which focus on customer segmentation with the intention of improving customer identification and increasing customer engagement.  Additionally
, we continue to implemen
t several innovative website features to enhance the customer online shopping experience, including a redesigned home page, additional BOPIS features, and enhanced shipping notifications.  Our improved e-commerce platform supports our stores with digital marketing and our BOPIS and ship-to-store programs.  These platforms allow us to connect further with our customers for marketing and product education and assists us in introducing customers to the Academy brand by reaching customers outside of our current store footprint.  During 2024, stores facilitated approximately 95% of our total sales, including ship-from-store, BOPIS and in-store retail sales.  We expect to continue to invest in expanding and enhancing our omnichannel capabilities, including our mobile app, optimizing the web site experience and upgrading our fulfillment capabilities, which will continue to require further investments by us.
We expect that new stores will be a key driver of growth in our net sales and gross margin in the future as we execute our new store opening growth plans. Our growth strategy encompasses both deepening our presence in existing markets as well as entering new markets, leveraging enhanced brand awareness and operational efficiencies. Our new store model favors off-mall locations within power centers or stand-alone buildings. We utilize comprehensive demographic and trade data to guide our real estate site selection. During the fiscal year 2024, we opened 16 new stores. We plan to open 20 to 25 stores in fiscal year 2025 and we are continuously evaluating available locations that meet our size requirements and market criteria. Our strategic real estate approach, including the 39 stores opened since fiscal year 2021, has positioned us effectively for continued expansion. 
47
Gross Margin.  
Gross margin is our net sales less cost of goods sold.  Our cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of merchandise and costs related to procurement, warehousing and distribution, which consist primarily of payroll and benefits, distribution center occupancy costs and freight and are generally variable in nature relative to our sales volume.
Our gross margin depends on a number of factors, such as net sales increases or decreases, our promotional activities, product mix including private label brand merchandise sales, and our ability to control cost of goods sold, such as inventory and logistics cost management.  Our gross margin is also impacted by variables including duties, tariffs, commodity costs, freight costs, shrinkage (discussed below), inventory processing costs, and e-commerce shipping costs.  We track and measure gross margin as a percentage of net sales in order to evaluate our performance against profitability targets.
We refer to loss or theft of inventory as “shrinkage” or “shrink.” A prolonged period of significant increased shrink could have a material negative impact on our gross margin and results of operations.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.  
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include store and corporate administrative payroll and payroll benefits, store and corporate headquarters occupancy costs, advertising, credit card processing, information technology, pre-opening costs and other store and administrative expenses.  These expenses are both variable and fixed in nature.  SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 23.3% in 2023 to 24.8% in 2024.  The majority of the increase in SG&A from the prior year was driven by investments in our growth initiatives, including costs related to new stores (such as additional property and facility fees, employee compensation costs and advertising costs).  We track and measure operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in order to evaluate our performance against profitability targets.  Management of SG&A expenses depends on our ability to balance a control of operating costs, such as store and corporate headcount, information technology infrastructure and marketing and advertising expenses, while efficiently and effectively servicing our customers.
Pre-opening expenses represent non-capital expenditures associated with the opening of new stores and distribution centers prior to sales generation or start of operations, which consist primarily of occupancy costs, marketing, payroll and recruiting costs, and are expensed as incurred.  As we execute our new store opening growth plans, we expect our pre-opening expenses to increase and result in a negative impact to SG&A as a percentage of sales. The following table summarizes our pre-opening expense activity for the periods presented:

During the fourth quarter of 2024, we closed on a sale-leaseback agreement involving a store property in Cypress, Texas. We determined that the sale-leaseback transaction qualifies as a sale in accordance with ASC 842 (See Note 11). In connection with the sale-leaseback transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately 
$7.1 million
 in Selling, General, and Administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Interest Expense. 
Interest expense includes regular interest payable related to our Term Loan, Notes and ABL Facility (see Note 4 to the accompanying financial statements) and the amortization of our deferred loan costs and original issuance discounts associated with the acquisition of the debt.  In 2022 and 2023, we utilized cash on hand to voluntarily prepay $100 million of outstanding borrowings on our Term Loan.  However, this prepayment in principal on our Term Loan was largely offset by increases made by the Federal Reserve to the federal funds benchmark rate during 2022 and 2023, resulting in a decrease in interest expense in 2024 compared to 2023. 
Income Tax Expense.  
ASO, Inc. is treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal, state, and local income tax purposes and accordingly, a provision for income taxes has been recorded for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations for federal, state and local income taxes.  Recent fluctuations in income tax expense have been primarily a result of changes in income before income taxes.

Fiscal year 2023 consisted of 53 weeks compared with 52 weeks in fiscal year 2024.  Merchandise net sales for the 53rd week in 2023 were $73.3 million.
* Percentages in table may not sum properly due to rounding.
 Net Sales
.
  Net sales decreased $225.8 million, or 3.7%, in fiscal year 2024 (a 52 week year) over fiscal year 2023 (a 53 week year). This is primarily a result of decreased comparable sales, which was partially offset by $88.5 million of net sales, including e-commerce, generated by 16 new stores opened since the end of the 2023 fiscal year. Since re-launching our new store program in 2022, we have opened 39 new stores, 23 of which have been open for at least twelve months. Over the last twelve months, those 23 stores have averaged approximately $13 million in net sales per store, including e-commerce. We believe that performance of new stores in year one is partially affected by the season in which the new store opens and the brand awareness in the region the new store opens.
Comparable sales decreased 5.1% driven by lower sales across all merchandise divisions as a result of a 6.3% decrease in comparable transactions, partially offset by an increase in average ticket of 1.2%. The decrease of 3.7% in net sales was driven by decreased sales of 6.5% in the sports and recreation merchandise division, 5.8% in the apparel division and 3.9% in the footwear division, partially offset by an increase of 0.7% in the outdoor merchandise division. Fiscal year 2024 was a 52 week year compared to fiscal year 2023, which was a 53 week year. Merchandise net sales for the 53rd week in 2023 were $73.3 million.  
E-commerce sales represented 10.5% of merchandise sales for 2024 compared to 10.7% for 2023.
49
Gross Margin.

Gross margin decreased $98.8 million, or 4.7%. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin decreased 40 basis points from 34.3% in 2023 to 33.9% in 2024. The decrease of 40 basis points in gross margin was primarily attributable to:
•
30 basis points of unfavorability due to increased supply chain costs associated with our transition to a new warehouse management system at our Georgia distribution center and increased freight costs; and 
•
10 basis points of unfavorability in merchandise margin as a result of a higher sales mix of hard goods 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.
  SG&A expenses increased $40.5 million, or 2.8%, to $1,472.8 million in 2024 from $1,432.4 million in 2023, primarily as a result of our increased strategic investments of $66.4 million in new stores and technology and deleverage from decreased sales. This was partially offset by an additional week of SG&A expense in the prior year of approximately $17.1 million as fiscal year 2023 was a 53-week year. 
Loss on early retirement of debt. 
We utilized cash on hand to voluntarily prepay $100 million of outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan in February of 2024, which resulted in a loss on early retirement of debt of $1.5 million for 2023.
Write off of Deferred Loan Costs.  
Write off of Deferred Loan Costs increased by $0.4 million for the year-to-date 2024 when compared with the year-to-date 2023, in connection with the amendment in the 2024 first quarter that led to the write off of deferred loan costs on the ABL Facility.
Interest Expense.
  Interest expense decreased $9.2 million, or 19.9%, to $36.9 million in 2024 from $46.1 million in 2023 resulting primarily from a lower outstanding balance on our long-term debt, driven by a voluntary prepayment of $100.0 million under the Term Loan made on February 1, 2024.
Other (Income), net. 
 Other (Income), net, increased $4.0 million in 2024 when compared to 2023, primarily driven by increased money market investments in the current year.
Income Tax Expense. 
 Income tax expense decreased $24.2 million to $119.8 million in 2024 as compared to $144.0 million in 2023
, resulting primarily from a decrease in pre-tax income.  ASO, Inc.'s effective tax rate for 2024 was 22.3% compared to 21.7% in 2023.  The increase in effective tax rate was largely driven by the decrease in pre-tax income in the current year, as well as decreased permanent adjustments related to stock compensation awards during 2024.
Non-GAAP Measures 
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, as shown below, have been presented in this Annual Report as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).  We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax expense and depreciation, amortization and impairment and other adjustments included in the table below.  We define Adjusted EBIT as Adjusted EBITDA less depreciation and amortization. We describe these adjustments reconciling net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and to Adjusted EBIT in the applicable table below.  We define Adjusted Net Income as net income (loss), plus other adjustments included in the table below, less the tax effect of these adjustments.  We define basic Adjusted Earnings per Share as Adjusted Net Income divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding during the period and diluted Adjusted Earnings per Share as Adjusted Net Income divided by the
 diluted weighted average common shares outstanding during the period.  We describe these adjustments by reconciling net income (loss) to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share in the applicable table below.  We describe Adjusted Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less net cash used in investing activities.  We describe this adjustment by reconciling net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the applicable table below.
We believe Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.  Management believes Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments.  Management believes Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a useful measure of liquidity and an additional basis for assessing our ability to generate cash.  Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management has also historically used Adjusted EBIT as a performance target to establish and award discretionary annual incentive compensation.
50
Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone.  Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or
 net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.  Additionally, these measures are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management’s discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements.  Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share should not be construed to imply th
at our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.  In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation.  Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share and Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments.
Our Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share and Adjusted Free Cash Flow measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.  Some of these limitations are:
•
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share do not reflect costs or cash outlays for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow does not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service principal payments on our debt;
•
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT do not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;
•
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations;
•
although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and
•
other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share and Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in business growth or to reduce indebtedness.  Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on our GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share and Adjusted Free Cash 
Flow supplementally.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
Sources and Uses of Liquidity
Our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital, capital expenditures and cash used to pay our debt obligations and related interest expense.  We also use cash to pay dividends and use cash to repurchase our common stock.  We may fund our liquidity requirements through cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operating activities, and borrowings under our ABL Facility (as defined below).  On February 1, 2025, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $288.9 million.  We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, as well as availability under the ABL Facility, will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
Long-Term Debt
As of February 1, 2025, the Company's long-term debt consists of:
•
Notes - 6.00% fixed rate senior secured notes with $400 million in principal outstanding and full principal maturing November 15, 2027;
•
Term Loan - 8.38% variable rate term-loan with $88.8 million in principal outstanding maturing November 6, 2027 and requiring quarterly principal payments of $750 thousand through September 30, 2027; and
•
ABL Facility - $1.0 billion commitment on a variable rate secured asset-based revolving credit facility with no principal outstanding maturing March 8, 2029.

Share Repurchases
On November 29, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the “2023 Share Repurchase Program”) under which the Company may purchase up to $600 million of its outstanding shares during the three-year period ending November 29, 2026.  
Under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program, repurchases can be made using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs and/or Rule 10b5-1 or other a non-discretionary trading plans, all in compliance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. The timing, manner, price and amount of any common share repurchases under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program are determined by the Company in its discretion and depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The 2023 Share Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular number of common shares, and the program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time.
On December 4, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to purchase up to 
$700 million 
of its outstanding shares during the three-year period ending December 4, 2027 (the “2024 Share Repurchase Program”), and which replaces the 2023 Share Repurchase Program. Under the 2024 Share Repurchase 
Program,
 repurchases can be made using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, block trades, accelerated share repurchase 
programs

Operating Activities.
  Cash flows from operating activities are seasonal in our business.  Typically, cash flows from operations are used to build inventory in advance of peak selling seasons, with the fourth quarter pre-holiday inventory increase being the most significant.
Cash provided by operating activities in 2024 decreased $7.7 million compared to 2023.  This decrease is attributable to:
•
$100.7 million decrease in net income; partially offset by
•
$28.0 million net increase in non-cash charges offset by a $7.1 million gain, net of fees, on a sale-leaseback transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 (see Note 11); and 
•
$71.7 million net increase in cash flows provided by operating assets and liabilities.
The increase in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to:
•
$208.1 million increase in cash flows from accounts payable, due to timing of payments for increased merchandise inventories relative to the prior year period; 
•
$40.1 million increase in cash flows from prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to an increase of $25 million related to a legal settlement in the fourth quarter of 2024 as well as timing of payments relative to the prior year period; and
•
$38.7 million increase in cash flows from accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by
•
$204.0 million decrease in cash flows from merchandise inventories, net due to lower sales in the current year period; and
•
$22.9 million decrease in cash flows from income taxes payables, due to timing of payments relative to the prior year period
Investing Activities
.  
Cash used in investing activities decreased $20.0 million in 2024 compared to 2023.  The decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily related to:
•
$8.2 million decrease in capital expenditures, primarily driven by decreased spending related to Corporate, e-commerce, and information technology programs in the year-to-date 2024 compared to the year-to-date 2023; and
•
$14.2 million increase in cash inflows from proceeds from a sale-leaseback transaction related to our retail store in Cypress, TX (see Note 11).
Financing Activities
.  
Cash used in financing activities increased $82.1 million in 2024, compared to 2023.  The primary drivers of the increase were:
•
$162.1 million increase in cash outflows primarily caused by an increase in repurchases and simultaneous retirement of common stock in the current year; and
•
$12.3 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options; partially offset by
•
$100 million decrease in cash outflows due to the prepayment of $100 million on our Term Loan in fiscal year 2023
57
Future Liquidity  
We expect our existing cash balances, internally generated cash flows and available borrowings under our ABL Facility will be fulfill anticipated obligations such as capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases, working capital needs and scheduled debt maturities for the foreseeable future.  As of February 1, 2025, we had $955.5 million of available capacity under our ABL Facility and $288.9 million of cash and cash equivalents.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that can have a meaningful effect on the reporting of consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information.
Critical accounting estimates are defined as those reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.  The Company believes the following are its critical accounting estimates:
Merchandise Inventories
Description:
  Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value.  Merchandise inventories include the direct cost of merchandise and capitalized costs related to procurement, warehousing and distribution and are reflected net of shrinkage, vendor allowances and other valuation reserves.
Judgments and Uncertainties:
  We record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories on a location by location basis.  We perform a full physical inventory count for each store at least once a year, throughout the year, after which our shrinkage accrual rate to sales for each store is updated based on historical results. For vendor allowances based on contractual provisions, we develop accrual rates for receivables as determined by the agreements, which are typically linked to purchase volumes.  Other non-contractual vendor allowances received are applied upon receipt.  We regularly review inventories and record a valuation adjustment when necessary such as for inventory that has a carrying value in excess of the net realizable value or for slow moving or obsolete inventory.
Impact of Assumptions: 
For inventory shrinkage, our reserves may be inaccurate if our historical physical inventory shrinkage rates, used in our assumptions, differ significantly from actual rates due to consistent misses to our accrual.  However, due to the frequency with which we perform full physical inventory counts, our assumptions are regularly updated, and we constantly analyze the physical inventory results to our accruals and, where necessary, adjust our store accruals to compensate for consistent patterns identified.  We have not had a history of significant differences to our reserves for vendor allowances, and the assumptions generally do not have a significant impact on reserves since they are typically short-term and contractual in nature. We book a reserve for inventory permanently marked down below the inventory’s historical cost.  Additionally, for slow moving or obsolete inventory, we book reserves based on historical margins received for marked down inventory with similarly slow historical sell-through rates.  A 20% decrease in assumed margins would not have a material impact to our financial statements.  We believe our long history of operations has given us sufficient data to enable us to accurately predict these reserves.
Impairment of long-lived assets
Description:
 We review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including property and equipment at our stores, for indicators of impairment regularly and whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Judgments and Uncertainties:
 We test stores operating over a long enough time span, based on our previous store history for similar locations, to allow for meaningful analysis of future operating results. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the assets, which is generally projected based on historical results.  If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its estimated fair value, which is calculated using discounted expected future cash flows.
58
Impact of Assumptions:
 The assumptions used to project store impairment loss is based on projected future store income and considers variables such as historical and current trends, macroeconomic conditions, store location and local economy and supply chain factors.  Additionally, the long-term store income projections also contain a projection of future store specific costs such as store wages and advertising. Actual long-term income results could vary significantly from our projections due to a variety of reasons such as changes in the local retail environment or macroeconomic factors not used in our assumptions. In addition to variables considered in developing projected long-term store income, assumptions are made to develop the assumed discount rate based on company specific factors. There is significant judgment used in determining these assumptions used in the assessment of store impairment and variability in the assumptions could cause us to reach a materially different conclusion on impairment, however, we do not believe the net book value of any individual store assets are material to the Company’s operations.
Goodwill
Description: 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable.  We test for goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment level.  We operate in one operating segment with one reporting unit.
Judgments and Uncertainties:
  The annual goodwill impairment test provides for the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to evaluate the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill.  However, if the qualitative assessment leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then no further assessments are required.
Our quantitative assessment for determining the fair value of our reporting unit includes using an estimated discounted cash flow model (income approach) and market value approach.  The output of this assessment is an estimated fair value for our reporting unit that is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment charge is necessary.  The income approach uses a discounted cash flow analysis of our projected long-term future company income, and the market value approach is based on earnings multiples for a comparable set of public companies as well as guideline transactions.  These approaches use key input assumptions such as our projected future operating results, the discount rate, the weighting for each valuation approach and the comparable set of companies and transactions.
Impact of Assumptions:
  The assumptions used to project long-term company income consider variables such as historical and current trends, macroeconomic conditions, supply chain factors, projections consistent with the Company’s operating strategy, such as the future development of e-commerce and our assumptions used on future store openings, and other variables expected to impact future sales.  Additionally, the long-term company income projections also contain a projection of future company costs such as wages, freight and transportation, and advertising. Actual long-term company income results could vary significantly from our projections due to a variety of reasons such as changes in the retail environment or macroeconomic factors not used in our assumptions. In addition to variables considered in developing projected long-term company income, assumptions are made to develop the discount rate, which is based on an assumed risk-free rate, and an equity risk premium developed from general historical market data and comparable companies.  The earnings multiples and control premiums used in the market approach can vary dependent on which companies and guideline transactions are selected in our comparable set. A history of declining trends in our operating results such as comparable sales, gross margin, net income and cash flow from operations could impact these assumptions and serve as indicators of future impairment.  There is significant judgment used in determining these assumptions used in the assessment of goodwill impairment and variability in the assumptions could cause us to reach a different conclusion on impairment.  In 2024, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by a significant margin. The Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, or fiscal 2022.
Intangible Assets
Description: 
 Intangible assets primarily consists of the trade name “Academy Sports + Outdoors” (the “Trade Name”).  The Trade Name is expected to generate cash flows indefinitely and, therefore, is accounted for as an indefinite-lived asset not subject to amortization.  The Trade Name is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the Trade Name may not be recoverable.
59
Judgments and Uncertainties:  
The annual Trade Name impairment test provides for the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to evaluate the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount.  If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment for the Trade Name.  However, if the qualitative assessment leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, then no further assessments are required.
Impairment is calculated as the excess of the Trade Name’s carrying value over its fair value.  The fair value of the Trade Name is determined using the relief-from-royalty method, a variation of the income approach.  This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets.  Once a supportable royalty rate is determined, the rate is then applied to the projected long-term sales over the expected remaining life of the intangible assets to estimate the royalty savings.  This approach is dependent on a number of factors, including projections of long-term sales, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables.
Impact of Assumptions:
  The assumptions used to project long-term company sales consider variables such as historical and current trends, macroeconomic conditions, supply chain factors, projections consistent with the Company’s operating strategy, such as the future development of e-commerce and our assumptions used on future store openings, and other variables expected to impact future sales. Actual long-term income results could vary significantly from our projections due to a variety of reasons such as changes in the retail environment or macroeconomic factors not used in our assumptions.  In addition to variables considered in developing projected long-term sales, assumptions are made to develop the royalty rates and discount rates.  The royalty rates are based on market data where royalty rates are applicable and the discount rates are based on an assumed risk-free rate, and an equity risk premium based on general historical market data and comparable companies. A history of declining trends in our operating results such as comparable sales, gross margin, net income and cash flow from operations could impact these assumptions and serve as indicators of future impairment.  There is significant judgment used in determining these assumptions on intangible asset impairment and variability in the assumptions could cause us to reach a different conclusion on impairment.  In 2024, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment and determined that the fair value of Trade Name exceeded its carrying amount by a significant margin. The Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to intangible assets during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, or fiscal 2022.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from our Term Loan and ABL Facility, as these borrowings have variable interest rates.  When appropriate, we also enter into fixed interest rate debt, such as the Notes, to limit the floating interest rate exposure on our long term debt or historically we have used derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk from such exposure. As of February 1, 2025, we do not have any derivative financial instruments outstanding.  The detrimental effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates on current borrowings under the Term Loan and ABL Facility would increase our interest expense by approximately $0.9 million.
Interim Results and Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.  A significant portion of our net sales and profits is driven by summer holidays, such as Memorial Day, Father’s Day and Independence Day, during the second quarter.  Our net sales and profits are also impacted by the August/September back-to-school selling season during the third quarter and November/December holiday selling season, and in part by the sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel during the fourth quarter.

Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
Our management, with the participation of our CEO and our CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report.  Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).  Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes:
•
maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions;
•
providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements;
•
providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and
•
providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.  Also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting which is set forth herein.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Other than as described above, no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the Company's most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of February 1, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2025, of the Company and our report dated March 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended February 1, 2025, and the related notes and schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 1, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Gain Contingency - Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
As described in Note 12 of the financial statements, in January 2025, the Company settled a legal matter pertaining to a third-party vendor where the Company is the plaintiff. In connection with this settlement, the Company recognized a net gain of approximately $15.0 million in Other (income), net on the consolidated statements of income, when the gain became realizable. Auditing management's accounting for, and disclosure of a contingency is complex and highly judgmental as it involved our assessment of the significant judgments made by management when determining whether an estimate of the amount of contingency could be made, and assessing whether a gain contingency was realized or realizable.
69
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to management’s judgment included the following, among others: 
•
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management’s identification, monitoring and evaluation of contingencies. 
•
We read documents provided to the Company by outside legal counsel, read letters received directly by us from internal and outside legal counsel, and evaluated the current status of the contingency based on discussions with internal and outside legal counsel.
•
We inspected minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors to search for any contradictory evidence, which may indicate that the accounting and disclosures for the contingency might not be appropriate.
•
We made inquiries of management, including the Company’s internal legal counsel and Chief legal officer, regarding the status of the contingency and whether any settlement discussions had been held.
•
We tested the amount of gain contingency realizable as of year end, including vouching the amount received and consideration of any contrary evidence for events subsequent to year end.
•
With the assistance of professionals in our firm having experience in accounting for contingencies, we evaluated the reasonableness of the judgments and accounting guidance used by the Company to record the gain contingency that was realizable as of year end.

ACADEMY SPORTS AND OUTDOORS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.
Nature of Operations
The Company
All references to “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company” in the financial statements refer to Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ASO, Inc.”) and the current parent holding company of our operations, and its consolidated subsidiaries.  We conduct our operations primarily through our parent holding company's indirect subsidiary, Academy, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership doing business as “Academy Sports + Outdoors”, or Academy, Ltd.  All of the Company’s sales and business operations occur at Academy, Ltd., and Academy, Ltd. is also the borrower and/or issuer of the Company’s long-term debt and the lessee of the Company's facilities.  
The Company is a leading full-line sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer in the United States in terms of net sales.  As of February 1, 2025, we operated 
298
 “Academy Sports + Outdoors” retail locations in 
19
 states and 
three
 distribution centers located in Katy, Texas, Twiggs County, Georgia and Cookeville, Tennessee. Our distribution centers receive, store and ship merchandise to our stores and customers.  We also sell merchandise to customers across most of the United States via our 
academy.com
 website.
Fiscal Year 
The Company’s fiscal year represents the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31 each year.  References herein to 2024 relate to the 52-week fiscal year ended February 1, 2025, and references herein to 2023 and 2022 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 and the 52-week fiscal year ended January 28, 2023, respectively.

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ASO, Inc. and its subsidiaries,  New Academy Holding Company, LLC (“NAHC”), Academy Managing Co., LLC, Associated Investors, LLC, Academy, Ltd., the Company's operating company, Academy International Limited, Mason Creek Insurance Co., LLC, and Academy Procurement Co., LLC.  NAHC, Academy Managing Co., LLC, and Associated Investors, LLC are intermediate holding companies.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Our management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Our most significant estimates and assumptions that materially affect the financial statements involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management including the valuation of merchandise inventories, and performing goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairment analyses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider credit and debit card transactions, which typically settle within three business days, demand deposits with banks, and all other highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
75
Financial Instruments 
Financial instruments are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, certain accrued liabilities and debt.  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of those instruments.  The fair value of debt is influenced by fluctuations in market conditions for interest rates (see Note 5).
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from vendors for vendor allowances and other accounts receivable.  We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on both historical experience and a specific identification basis.
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments which subject us to potential credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents.  We have established guidelines to limit our exposure to credit risk on cash and cash equivalents by placing investments with high credit quality financial institutions.  Deposits with these financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided; however, these deposits typically are redeemable upon demand.  We believe that the financial risks associated with these financial instruments are minimal.
We purchase merchandise inventories from approximately 
1,500
 vendors.  In each of the years 2024, 2023 and 2022, purchases from our largest vendor represented approximately 
11
% of our total inventory purchases.  No other vendor in any of the aforementioned years exceeded 11% of our purchases.  We typically do not enter into long-term inventory purchase commitments, and we did not have any such commitments as of February 1, 2025 or February 3, 2024.
A significant portion of our inventory purchases are manufactured outside of the United States, primarily in Asia.  While we are not dependent on any single manufacturer outside of the United States, we could be adversely affected by political, health (including pandemic), safety, security, economic, tariff, climate, war or other disruptions affecting the business or operations of third-party manufacturers located outside of the United States.
The Company’s geographic concentration in the southern United States subjects us to certain regional risks, such as the state of regional economies, including downturns in the housing market, increased unemployment and gas prices. Other regional risks include legislation, politics, cultural views, severe weather conditions or man-made disasters (such as an oil spill closing large areas of hunting or fishing), fires, heat waves, freezes, hurricanes, tornadoes, large storms and floods and other natural disasters specific to the states in which the Company operates.
Merchandise Inventories, net 
Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value.  Merchandise inventories include the direct cost of merchandise and capitalized costs related to procurement, warehousing and distribution and are reflected net of shrinkage, vendor allowances and other valuation reserves.  We record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories on a by location basis.  We generally perform a full physical inventory count for each store at least once a year, throughout the year, after which our shrinkage accrual rate for each store is updated based on historical results.  For vendor allowances based on contractual provisions, we develop accrual rates as determined by the agreements, which are typically linked to purchase volumes. Other non-contractual vendor allowances received are applied upon receipt.  We regularly review inventories and record a valuation adjustment when necessary such as for inventory that has a carrying value in excess of the net realizable value or for slow moving or obsolete inventory.
76
Supplier Finance Programs
We have previously entered into a supply chain financing arrangement with a third-party financial institution, whereby certain suppliers have the ability to settle outstanding payment obligations earlier than the due date required by our original supplier terms.  Subsequently, we settle invoices with the financial institution within 
45
 days, which approximates our original supplier terms.  The Company does not have an economic interest in suppliers’ voluntary participation, does not provide any guarantees or pledge assets under these arrangements, and our rights and obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due, are not impacted.

The following table shows our liability associated with these arrangements, which is presented within 
accounts payable
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the related activity for the periods presented (amounts in thousands):

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Cost includes interest capitalized on borrowings used to finance the construction of stores and other significant capital projects while under construction.  
Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the asset’s useful life, which is generally determined by asset category as follows:
Leasehold improvements
Lesser of asset useful life or lease term  
Software and computer equipment
2
–
5
 years
Other equipment    
5
–
10
 years
Furniture and fixtures 
7
–
10
 years
Buildings
40
 years
When assets are retired or sold, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant improvements that substantially enhance the useful life or enhance the functionality of an asset are capitalized and amortized.
Capitalized Computer Software Costs
We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use.  Capitalized computer software costs are included in property and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software. 
 The amounts capitalized were $
29.0
 million, $
33.3
 million and $
33.3
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Implementation costs for cloud-based information systems are capitalized in other non-current assets. Amortization of cloud-based software implementation costs is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses and cost of goods sold, which is amortized over the longer of the contract term or expected benefit.
  The amounts capitalized were $
20.6
 million, $
23.5
 million and $
12.3
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Capitalized Interest

We capitalized interest primarily related to construction of new stores, store renovations, distribution centers and IT projects in the amount of $
1.7
 million, $
2.1
 million and $
0.6
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest expense, net on the consolidated statement of income is shown net of capitalized interest.
77
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
We review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including store assets, for indicators of impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the assets, which is generally projected based on historical results.  If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its estimated fair value, which is calculated using discounted expected future cash flows.  As a result of our assessment, we did 
no
t record an impairment of long-lived assets in 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Goodwill  
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable.  We test for goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment level.  We operate in 
one
 operating segment with 
one
 reporting unit.
The annual goodwill impairment test provides for the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to evaluate the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill.  However, if the qualitative assessment leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then no further assessments are required.  
Our quantitative assessment for determining the fair value of our reporting unit includes using an estimated discounted cash flow model (income approach) and market value approach.  The output of this assessment is an estimated fair value for our reporting unit that is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an impairment charge is necessary.  The income approach uses a discounted cash flow analysis of our projected long-term future company income. The market valu
e approach is based on earnings multiples for a comparable set of public companies as well as guideline transactions.
We did 
not
 record an impairment of goodwill for 2024, 2023 or 2022.
Intangible Assets 
Intangible assets primarily consists of the trade name “Academy Sports + Outdoors” (the “Trade Name”).  The Trade Name is expected to generate cash flows indefinitely and, therefore, is accounted for as an indefinite-lived asset not subject to amortization.
The Trade Name is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the Trade Name may not be recoverable.  The annual Trade Name impairment test provides for the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to evaluate the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount.  If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment for the Trade Name. However, if the qualitative assessment leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, then no further assessments are required.  
Impairment is calculated as the excess of the Trade Name’s carrying value over its fair value.  The fair value of the Trade Name is determined using the relief-from-royalty method, a variation of the income approach.  This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets.  Once a supportable royalty rate is determined, the rate is then applied to the projected long-term sales over the expected remaining life of the intangible assets to estimate the royalty savings.  This approach is dependent on a number of factors, including projections of long-term sales, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables.
We did 
not
 record an impairment of intangible assets for 2024, 2023 or 2022.
78
Deferred Loan Costs

Costs incurred to issue debt are deferred and recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Those costs related to the issuance of our term loan and senior notes are recorded in long-term debt, net of current maturities and amortized as a component of interest expense over the terms of the related debt agreement using the effective interest method.  The costs related to the issuance of our revolving credit facility is recorded in other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized as a component of interest expense over the terms of the related debt agreements using the straight-line method.
Self-Insurance 
We maintain deductibles or self-insured retentions for workers' compensation, general liability and employee health benefits.  The Company has a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary (the “Captive”) with the primary purpose to enhance the Company's risk financing strategies by providing the Company the opportunity to negotiate insurance premiums in the non-retail insurance market. The Captive must maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to fund future reserve payments and secure the insurer's obligations for workers compensation, Texas non-subscriber, general liability, directors and officers liability, employment practices liability, and medical stop-loss programs. Additionally, we use the services of an independent actuary to assist in determining losses associated with workers' compensation, general liability and employee health benefits.  Liabilities associated with these losses are actuarially derived and estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, industry factors, severity factors, claim development, as well as other actuarial assumptions.  If actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  Changes in legal claims, claim development, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers and changes in discount rates could all adversely affect our ultimate expected losses.  We believe the actuarial valuation provides the best estimate of the ultimate expected losses, and we have recorded the present value of the actuarially determined ultimate losses for the insurance related liabilities mentioned above.
Leases
We account for our leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842 which requires that lessees recognize assets and liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.  
Nearly all of our store locations and all of our corporate office facilities, and warehouse and distribution centers are leased.  We may receive reimbursement from a landlord for some or all of the cost of a construction project, which may be structured as a tenant improvement allowance or a construction allowance.  Cash received from a landlord for tenant improvement allowances in store lease transactions is a reduction to the right-of-use assets on the balance sheet, which is amortized ratably over the remaining terms of
 the corresponding leases.  Cash received for construction allowances is a reimbursement of certain spend incurred in the construction of the premises on behalf of the landlord, where the landlord owns the assets. In 2024, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction which qualified for sale accounting under ASC 606. Further, per ASC 842, a gain was recognized up to the fair value of the asset (see Note 11).  
We account for each lease and non-lease components for our building leases as a single lease component which allows certain costs such as common area maintenance associated with these leases to be included as rent expense.  We exclude leases with contract terms of 12 months or less from ASC 842 accounting treatment, which results in straight-line recognition of the cost over the lease term with no associated balance sheet lease liability or right-of-use asset.
Net Sales
We sell merchandise under implicit contracts whereby the transaction price is the listed sales price less any discounts or coupons applied.  Our typical coupons offer a discount, which is applied immediately at the time of purchase.  However, under certain circumstances we may issue a coupon, or similar incentive, which may contain a material future right. 
Revenue from merchandise sales is recognized, net of sales tax, when the Company’s performance obligation to the customer is met, which is when the Company transfers control of the merchandise to the customer.  Store merchandise sales are recognized at the point of sale.  For e-commerce sales, significant judgment is applied in determining when the transfer of control occurs, which we believe occurs upon

customer receipt, and accordingly online merchandise sales are recognized upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer.  The Company does not extend a material amount of credit.  
79
The sales return allowance, which is our provision for anticipated merchandise returns, is provided through a reduction of sales and cost of goods sold on a gross basis in the period that the related sales are recorded.  The sales return allowance and related liability are included in merchandise inventories and in accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Merchandise returns are estimated based on historical experience.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of merchandise and costs related to procurement, warehousing and distribution.  These costs consist primarily of payroll and benefits, occupancy costs, depreciation and freight.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales.  Shipping and handling costs that we incur associated with shipping products to customers are included in cost of goods sold.
Vendor Allowances 
Vendor allowances include volume purchase rebates, promotional and advertising allowances, cooperative advertising funds and support for new store openings.  These allowances are generally determined for each fiscal year.  Allowances related to the purchase of merchandise inventories are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold as the related merchandise is sold.  Allowances for cooperative advertising and promotion programs and other expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as a reduction of the related costs as the related expense is incurred.  Any such allowance in excess of actual costs incurred that are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, or that do not require proof of performance, are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales.  For volume purchase rebates, we record an estimate of vendor allowances earned based on the latest projected purchase volumes.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses include store and corporate administrative payroll and payroll benefits, store and corporate headquarters occupancy costs, depreciation, advertising, credit card processing, information technology, pre-opening costs and other store and administrative expenses.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, we closed on a sale-leaseback agreement involving a store property in Cypress, Texas. We determined that the sale-leaseback transaction qualifies as a sale in accordance with ASC 842 (See Note 11). In connection with the sale-leaseback transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately 
$
7.1
 million
 in Selling, General, and Administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
  Advertising expenses, net of specific vendor allowances, were $
155.7
 million, $
153.7
 million and $
144.5
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Pre-Opening Expenses
Non-capital expenditures associated with opening new stores and distribution centers prior to sales generation or start of operations, which consist primarily of occupancy costs, marketing, payroll and recruiting costs, are expensed as incurred.

The following table summarizes our pre-opening expense activity for the periods presented:

Equity Compensation 
We account for equity compensation in accordance with ASC 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all equity awards made to employees based on estimated fair values on the grant date.  Option equity award fair values are estimated on the date of grant using an option-pricing model and restricted unit fair values are based on the estimated unit price on the date of the grant.  For awards with service-based vesting requirements only, the fair value of the award is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, and for awards with performance-based vesting requirements, the fair value of the award ultimately expected to meet the performance target is recognized as expense over the service period.  We recognize forfeitures as they occur.
Share Repurchases
On November 29, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the “2023 Share Repurchase Program”) under which the Company may purchase up to $
600
 million of its outstanding shares during the 
three-year
 period ending November 29, 2026.  
Under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program, repurchases can be made using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs and/or Rule 10b5-1 or other non-discretionary trading plans, all in compliance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. The timing, manner, price and amount of any common share repurchases under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program are determined by the Company in its discretion and depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, economic and market conditions. The 2023 Share Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular number of common shares, and the program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time.
On December 4, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to purchase up to $
700
 million of its outstanding shares during the 
three-year
 period ending December 4, 2027 (the “2024 Share Repurchase Program”), and which replaces the 2023 Share Repurchase Program. Under the 2024 Share Repurchase 
Program,
 repurchases can be made using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, block trades, accelerated share repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions and/or Rule 10b5-1 or other non-discretionary trading plans, all in compliance with the rules of the SEC and other applicable legal requirements. The timing, manner, price and amount of any common share repurchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program will be determined by the Company in its discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, economic and market conditions. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular number of common shares, and the program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time.
The following table summarizes our share repurchases for the periods presented:

The Company allocates the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of shares acquired to Retained Earnings and Additional Paid-in Capital. The portion allocated to Additional Paid-in Capital is determined by dividing the number of shares to be retired by the number of shares issued multiplied by the balance of Additional Paid-in Capital as of the retirement date.  As of February 1, 2025, we had $
635.5
 million available for share repurchases pursuant to the 2024 Share Repurchase Program.

Income Taxes
The Company is subject to U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes.  We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be 
81
realized or settled.  The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized.  In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including recent results of operations, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of the asset will not be realized.  The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more-likely-than-not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.  The tax benefits recognized from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit having a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately sustained.  Interest and penalties from income tax matters are recognized in income tax expense.
Reclassifications
Within the reconciliation table of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to our effective income tax rate presented in Note 10, certain tax effects were allocated among the effect of tax credits and the effect of other permanent items on the effective tax rate during 2023 due to the Company’s purchase of energy credits under the new Inflation Reduction Act related to tax years ending February 3, 2024 and February 1, 2025.  As a result, we have reclassified the effect of other permanent items for fiscal year 2023 for comparability purposes (there was no impact to fiscal year 2022).  This reclassification is in presentation only and did not impact the balances previously disclosed.
Other Income
During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company received and recognized approximately $
7.2
 million in business interruption proceeds due to the suspension of normal operations at some of our Texas store locations, as well as our e-commerce platform, for several days in February of 2021 as a result of a winter storm which had a significant impact on the energy infrastructure in the state of Texas.  Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2022 the Company completed a sale in which we factored rights to pursue a legal matter pertaining to the overpayment of certain tariffs and we received and recognized net proceeds of approximately $
3.7
 million.  The proceeds for both events are included in Other (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company settled a legal matter with credit card companies pertaining to the overcharge of credit card interchange fees for prior periods dating back to 2004.  In connection with this settlement, we recognized a net gain of approximately $
15.9
 million in Other (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company settled a legal matter with a third-party vendor.  In connection with this settlement, we recognized a net gain of approximately $
15.0
 million in Other (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Operating Segment
Given the similar business activities, economic characteristics, products sold, customer base and methods of procurement, as well as the similar marketing and promotional activities of our stores and our 
academy.com
 website, we report our financial results as 
one

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting Guidance Adopted
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which is intended to enhance the disclosures on reportable segments.  Under this pronouncement, all public entities (including those with a single reporting segment) are required to include incremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments, including disclosure of disaggregated expense information that is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and should be adopted retrospectively.  
The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 retrospectively effective February 1, 2025 (see Note 14). The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statement disclosures.
Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
.  This pronouncement is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures and establishes new income tax disclosure requirements, including requiring disaggregation of a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation and disaggregation of the income taxes paid based on the applicable tax jurisdiction.

Other sales consists primarily of the gift card breakage income, credit card bounties and royalties, shipping income, net hunting and fishing license income, sales return allowance and other items.
We sell gift cards in stores, online and in third-party retail locations.  The gift cards we sell have no expiration dates.  A liability for gift cards, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, is established at the time of sale and revenues are recognized as the gift cards are redeemed in stores or on our website.  Based on historical gift card redemption patterns, we believe we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards that have a remote likelihood of redemption.  These identified amounts are recorded as net sales and recognized in proportion to historical redemption trends, which is referred to as “breakage”.

On December 15, 2022 and February 1, 2024, the Company utilized cash on hand to voluntarily prepay $
100.0
 million of outstanding borrowings of the Term Loan, respectively.
Term Loan
We refer to the 2020 Term Loan and then amendments thereto collectively as the “Term Loan”.
On November 6, 2020, Academy, Ltd. entered into a 
seven-year
 $
400.0
 million senior secured term loan (the “2020 Term Loan”) with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Island Branch (“Credit Suisse”), as the administrative agent and collateral agent and the several other lenders and parties named therein.  The 2020 Term Loan bore interest, at Academy, Ltd.’s election, at either (1) LIBOR rate with a floor of 
0.75
%, plus a margin of 
5.00
%, or (2) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 
0.50
%, (b) Credit Suisse’s “prime rate”, or (c) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 
1.00
%, plus a margin of 
4.00
%.  In connection with the 2020 Term Loan, the Company capitalized related professional fees of $
5.8
 million as deferred loan costs.
On May 25, 2021, Academy, Ltd. entered into Amendment No. 4 (the “2021 Amendment”). Pursuant to the terms of the 2021 Amendment, Academy, Ltd. (i) reduced the applicable margin on LIBOR borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement from 
5.00
% to 
3.75
% and (ii) utilized cash on hand to repay $
99.0
 million of outstanding borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement, leaving an outstanding principal balance of $
300.0
 million under the Amended Credit Agreement.  In connection with the principal payment in the 2021 Amendment, the Company recognized a non-cash loss on early retirement of debt of $
2.2
 million in 2021 from the write-off of deferred loan costs related to the original issuance discount associated with our 2020 Term Loan.
84
On December 15, 2022, the Company utilized cash on hand to voluntarily prepay $
100.0
 million of outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan.  In connection with this principal payment, the Company recognized a non-cash loss on early retirement of debt of $
2.0
 million in 2022 from the write-off of deferred loan costs related to the original issuance discount associated with the Term Loan. 
On May 17, 2023, Academy, Ltd. entered into a Conforming Changes Amendment (the “2023 Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of November 6, 2020, among Academy, Ltd., as Borrower, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as the administrative agent and collateral agent and the several lenders party thereto and the several other parties named therein, which updated the Term Loan benchmark base interest rate from LIBOR to Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Conforming Changes Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The transition of our Term Loan to Adjusted Term SOFR became effective on August 1, 2023. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest, at our election, at either (1) Adjusted Term SOFR with a floor of 
0.75
% rate plus a margin of 
3.75
% or (2) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 
0.50
%, (b) the U.S. “prime rate” announced by the administrative agent, or (c) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR with a floor of 
0.75
% rate, plus a margin of 
3.75
%. As of February 1, 2025, the weighted average interest rate was 
8.38
%, with interest payable monthly. Quarterly principal payments of $
750.0
 thousand are required through September 30, 2027 and borrowings mature on November 6, 2027. The terms and conditions of the Term Loan also require that the outstanding balance under the Term Loan is prepaid under certain circumstances.
On February 1, 2024, the Company utilized cash on hand to voluntarily prepay $
100.0
 million of outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan.  In connection with this principal payment, the Company recognized a non-cash loss on early retirement of debt of $
1.5
 million in 2023 from the write-off of deferred loan costs related to the original issuance discount associated with the Term Loan.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default such as failure to pay principal or interest, breaches of representations and warranties, violations of affirmative or negative covenants, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, rendering of certain monetary judgments, invalidity of collateral documents and changes of control.  As of February 1, 2025, no prepayment was due under the terms and conditions of the Term Loan.
Notes
On November 6, 2020, as a part of the Refinancing Transactions, Academy, Ltd. issued $
400.0
 million of 
6.00
% senior secured notes which are due November 15, 2027 (the “Notes”), pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 6, 2020 (the “Indenture”), with Academy, Ltd. the Guarantors (as defined below) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee and collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Notes Collateral Agent”).  The Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears in cash on May 15 and November 15 of each year at a rate of 
6.00
% per year, which commenced on May 15, 2021.  In connection with issuance of the Notes, the Company capitalized related professional fees of $
5.2
 million as deferred loan costs.
The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of NAHC, Associated Investors L.L.C. and Academy Managing Co., L.L.C., each a direct or indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the “Guarantors”), and each of Academy, Ltd.’s future wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, to the extent such subsidiary guarantees Academy, Ltd.’s senior secured credit facilities or certain capital markets debt.
On or after November 15, 2023, Academy, Ltd. may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem all or a part of the Notes at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date.  At any time prior to November 15, 2023, Academy, Ltd. may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium as described in the Indenture.  In addition, at any time prior to November 15, 2023, Academy, Ltd. may, at its option and on one or more occasions, redeem up to 
40
% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 
106
% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, with an amount equal to or less than the net cash proceeds from one or more equity offerings to the extent such net cash proceeds are received by or contributed to Academy, Ltd., plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date.
Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), Academy, Ltd. will be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the Notes at a price equal to 
101
% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
85
The Indenture provides for events of default which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of other agreements in respect of the Notes, acceleration of certain other indebtedness, failure to pay certain final judgments, failure of certain guarantees to be enforceable, failure to perfect certain collateral securing the Notes and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, which events of default, if any occur, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then-outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately.
ABL Facility
We refer to the 2020 ABL Facility and the amendments thereto collectively as the “ABL Facility”.
On November 6, 2020, as a part of the Refinancing Transactions, Academy, Ltd., as borrower, and the Guarantors, as guarantors, amended the previously existing secured asset-based revolving credit facility by entering into an amendment to the First Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement, dated as of July 2, 2015, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the administrative agent and collateral agent, letter of credit issuer and swingline lender (the “ABL Agent”) and the several lenders party thereto, which ABL amendment (the “2020 ABL Facility”), among other things, extended the maturity of Academy, Ltd.’s asset-based revolving credit facility thereunder to November 6, 2025.  In connection with the 2020 ABL Facility, the Company capitalized related professional fees of $
3.1
 million as deferred loan costs.
On March 30, 2023, Academy, Ltd., as borrower, and the guarantors, amended the 2020 ABL Facility by entering into an amendment to the First Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement, dated as of July 2, 2015, with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the ABL Agent and the several lenders party thereto, which ABL amendment updated its benchmark base interest rate from LIBOR to Adjusted Term SOFR.

The ABL Facility is used to provide financing for working capital and other general corporate purposes, as well as to support certain letters of credit requirements, and availability is subject to customary borrowing base and availability provisions.  During the normal course of business, we periodically utilize letters of credit primarily in support of insurance contracts and occasionally for the purchase of import goods. As of February 1, 2025, we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $
9.3
 million, all of which were issued under the ABL Facility, and we had 
no
 borrowings outstanding under the ABL Facility, leaving the available borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility of $
955.5
 million.
Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest, at our election, at either of (1) Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of 
1.25
% to 
1.75
%, or (2) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 
0.50
%, (b) JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s “prime rate”, or (c) the one-month Adjusted Term SOFR rate plus 
1.00
%, plus a margin of 
0.25
% to 
0.75
%.  The ABL Facility also provides a fee applicable to the unused commitments of 
0.375
%.  The terms and conditions of the ABL Facility also require that we prepay outstanding loans under the ABL Facility under certain circumstances.  As of February 1, 2025, no future prepayments of outstanding loans have been triggered under the terms and conditions of the ABL Facility.
On March 8, 2024 Academy, Ltd. (“Academy”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc., as borrower, New Academy Holding Company, LLC, Associated Investors, L.L.C. and Academy Managing Co., L.L.C., each a direct or indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as guarantors, entered into an amendment (the “ABL Amendment”) to the First Amended and Restated ABL Credit Agreement, dated as of July 2, 2015, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the administrative agent and collateral agent, letter of credit issuer and swingline lender, and the several lenders party thereto, which ABL Amendment, among other things, extended the maturity of Academy’s asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Credit Facility”) to March 8, 2029, unless if (i) more than $
100
 million of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Senior Notes (as defined in the ABL Amendment) or the Term Loans (as defined in the ABL Amendment), or any refinancing thereof, in each case, is outstanding on the date that is 
91
 days prior to the earliest maturity date of any such indebtedness or (ii) equal to or less than $
100
 million of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Senior Notes or the Term Loans, in either case, is outstanding on the date that is 
91
 days prior to the earliest maturity date of any such indebtedness and a Reserve (as defined in the ABL Amendment) in the ABL Credit Facility has not been taken for such amount, then the maturity date of the ABL Credit Facility will be the date that is 
91
 days earlier than the earlier maturity date of the 2027 Senior Notes and the Term Loans.  In connection with the ABL Amendment and the reduction of two lenders who dropped out of the ABL Facility, the Company wrote off $
0.4
 million of deferred loan costs related to the ABL Facility.
86
Liens and guarantees.

The ABL Facility has a first priority lien on all Academy, Ltd.'s cash, accounts receivable, inventory, deposit and securities accounts and proceeds therefrom (the “ABL Collateral”).  Additionally, the ABL Facility has a second priority lien on all other collateral of the Term Loan.  All obligations under the Term Loan and the guarantees of those obligations are secured by:
•
a second-priority security interest in the ABL Collateral;
•
a first-priority security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all present and after acquired tangible and intangible assets of Academy, Ltd and the Guarantors; and
•
a first-priority pledge of 
100
% of the capital stock of Academy, Ltd. and its domestic subsidiaries and 
66
% of the voting capital stock of each of Academy, Ltd.'s foreign subsidiaries, if any, that are directly owned by Academy, Ltd. or a future U.S. guarantor, if any.
The Term Loan is guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior secured basis.  All obligations under the Term Loan and the guarantees of those obligations will be secured by:
•
a second-priority security interest in the ABL Priority Collateral;
•
a first-priority security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all present and after acquired tangible and intangible assets of Academy and the Guarantors; and 
•
a first-priority pledge of 
100
% of the capital stock of Academy and its domestic subsidiaries and 
66
% of the voting capital stock of each of Academy’s foreign subsidiaries, if any, that are directly owned by Academy or a future U.S. guarantor, if any.
In order to secure the Notes and the guarantees, Academy, Ltd. and the Guarantors entered into certain security documents with the Notes Collateral Agent, including a security agreement and a pledge agreement, each dated as of November 6, 2020.  The Notes and the guarantees are secured by:
•
a first-priority lien on all of Academy, Ltd.’s and the Guarantors’ personal property that secure the Term Loan on a first-priority basis; and
•
a second-priority lien on Academy, Ltd.’s and the Guarantors’ personal property consisting of accounts and all other rights to payment, inventory, tax refunds, cash, deposit accounts, securities and commodities accounts, and documents and supporting obligations, securing the ABL Facility on a first-priority basis and the Term Loan on a second-priority basis (the “ABL Priority Collateral”).
Covenants.
  The ABL Facility, Term Loan and Notes agreements contain covenants, including, among other things, covenants that may restrict Academy, Ltd.'s ability to incur certain additional indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, engage in mergers or consolidations, pay dividends, make other restricted payments, make loans or advances, engage in transactions with affiliates or amend material documents.  Additionally, at certain times, the ABL Facility is subject to a minimum adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio.  These covenants are subject to certain qualifications and limitations.  We were in compliance with these covenants as of February 1, 2025.
As of February 1, 2025, scheduled principal payments on our debt are as follows (amounts in thousands):

Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as an exit price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  Authoritative guidance establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities.

The fair value measurements are classified as either:
•
Level 1 which represents valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
•
Level 2 which represents valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and
•
Level 3 which represents valuations based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is classified in its entirety, is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.  There were no transfers made into or out of the Level 1, 2 or 3 categories during any period presented.
Other Financial Instruments
Periodically we make cash investments in money market funds comprised of U.S. Government treasury bills and securities, which are classified as cash and redeemable on demand.  We held investments in money market funds of $
256.9
 million and $
303.4
 million as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, respectively.
The fair value of the Term Loan and Notes is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on quoted market prices for the instrument in an inactive market and is therefore classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Term Loan and Notes was $
0.5
 billion and $
0.5
 billion, respectively.  As borrowings on the ABL Facility are generally repaid in less than 12 months, we believe that fair value approximates the carrying value.

2011 Unit Incentive Plan
The 2011 Unit Incentive Plan provides for the grant of certain equity incentive awards (each, an “Award”), such as options to purchase ASO, Inc. common stock (each, a “Unit Option”) and restricted units that may settle in ASO, Inc. common stock (each, a “Restricted Unit”) to our directors, executives, and eligible employees of the Company.
Unit Options granted under the 2011 Unit Incentive Plan consist of Unit Options that vest upon the satisfaction of time-based requirements (each, a “Service Unit Option”) and Unit Options that vest upon the satisfaction of both time-based requirements and Company performance-based requirements (each, a “Performance Unit Option”).
Restricted Units granted under the 2011 Unit Incentive Plan consist of Restricted Units that vest upon the satisfaction of time-based requirements (each, a “Service Restricted Unit”) and Restricted Units that vest upon the satisfaction of a liquidity event-based requirement together with a time-based requirement and/or a performance-based requirement (each, a “Liquidity Event Restricted Unit”).  In each case, vesting of the Company’s outstanding and unvested Unit Options and Restricted Units is contingent upon the holder’s continued service through the date of each applicable vesting event.
Concurrent with the adoption of the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan on October 1, 2020, no further Awards are authorized to be granted under the 2011 Unit Incentive Plan.
2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan
The 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan provides for the grant of Awards such as options to purchase ASO, Inc. common stock (each, a “Stock Option”) and restricted stock units which may settle in ASO, Inc. common stock (each, a “Restricted Stock Unit”) to our directors, executives, and eligible employees of the Company.
Stock Options granted under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan consist of Stock Options that vest upon the satisfaction of time-based requirements, each, a “Service Stock Option” (Service Unit Options and Service Stock Options together are “Service Options”).
Restricted Stock Units granted under the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan consist of Restricted Stock Units that vest upon the satisfaction of time-based requirements (each, a “Service Restricted Stock Unit”) and Restricted Stock Units that vest upon the satisfaction of a time-based requirement and performance-based and/or market-based requirements (each, a “Performance Restricted Stock Unit”).  In each case, vesting of the Company’s outstanding and unvested Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units is contingent upon the holder’s continued service through the date of each applicable vesting event.
ESPP
Our ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 
15
% of their eligible earnings toward the semi-annual purchase of the Company's shares of common stock at a discount of 
15
% of the closing stock price on the first or last day of the 
six-month
 offering period, whichever is lower.
The number of shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP will be increased automatically on the first day of each fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 2021, by a number equal to the lesser of (1) 
1,000,000
 shares of common stock, (2) 
2.0
% of the total number of all classes of the company's common stock outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (3) a lower number of shares determined by the ASO, Inc. Board of Directors.
Service Option Fair Value Assumptions
The fair value for Service Options granted was estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  The expected lives of the Service Options granted were based on the “SEC simplified” method.  Expected price volatility was determined based on our own volatility and the implied volatilities of comparable companies over a historical period that matches the expected life of the Service Options.  The risk-free interest rate was based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life.  In 2022 and 2023, the dividend yield was based on the most recent annualized quarterly dividend and the valuation date closing stock price. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of Service Options granted are evaluated and modified, as necessary, to reflect current market conditions and experience.

Vesting
The Company's outstanding and unvested Service Options typically vest ratably over a 
three
 or 
four-year
 period, on each anniversary of their grant date.
The Company’s outstanding and unvested Service Restricted Units generally vest ratably over a 
three
 of 
four-year
 period on each anniversary of their grant date.  In more limited grants, Service Restricted Units vest 
100
% on the first anniversary of the grant date, or, if earlier, the business day immediately preceding the following annual meeting of stockholders.
The Company’s outstanding and unvested Performance Restricted Units typically vest either (i) if granted during 2023 or 2024, on the third anniversary of the Performance Restricted Unit's performance period if the Company achieves the performance metrics for the performance period, or (ii) if granted prior to 2023, annually each year on the vesting commencement date, so long as the Company achieved (a) the performance metric for the performance period or (b) achieves a stated target share price.
In the event of certain Company change of control transactions, the Company's then-outstanding and unvested Awards will become fully vested and exercisable subject to certain criteria (as defined in the award agreements).  For certain Awards granted in 2022 and all Awards granted in 2023, for team members that meet the age and service requirement for retirement eligibility (as defined in the award agreement), such Awards do not require the continued employment of the team member for vesting eligibility.  In such cases, expensing of Awards is accelerated through the retirement eligibility date.

Earnings per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share is calculated based on net income divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding during the period, and diluted earnings per common share is calculated based on net income divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.  Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding is based on the basic weighted average common shares outstanding plus any potential dilutive effect of stock-based awards outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method, which assumes the potential proceeds received from the dilutive stock options are used to purchase treasury stock.  Anti-dilutive stock-based awards do not include awards which have a performance or liquidity event target which has yet to be achieved.
Basic and dilutive weighted average common shares outstanding and basic and diluted earnings per common share  are calculated as follows (amounts in thousands except per share amounts):

Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances annually.  As of February 1, 2025, based on current facts and circumstances, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize benefit for its gross deferred tax assets.
As of February 1, 2025, we had 
no
 unrecognized tax benefits and we do not anticipate that unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease over the next twelve months.  The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and files tax returns in various state and local jurisdictions.  The statute of limitations is open for federal and state tax audits for the tax fiscal years ending 2022 through 2024, and 2021 through 2024, respectively.
11.
Leases
With the exception of two retail stores which we own, we lease all of our retail stores, distribution centers and corporate offices.  Our leases primarily relate to building leases, which generally include options to renew at our sole discretion for 
five years
 or more.  We regularly extend options for our building leases, which constitutes a lease modification and such events require a re-measurement of the lease liability at current discount rates.  The life of leasehold improvement assets are limited by the expected lease term. Additionally, we have certain agreements for equipment rentals, which are typically 12 months or less in duration.  As of February 1, 2025, all of our leases are classified as operating leases.  In addition, in certain situations, we may sublease real estate to third parties.  Our sublease portfolio consists mainly of former store locations for which we are still under lease and existing store leases in which we have excess or unused space.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, we closed on a sale-leaseback agreement involving a store property in Cypress, Texas. We determined that the transaction met the accounting criteria for sale-leaseback treatment and we recognized a net gain of approximately 
$
7.1
 million
 in Selling, General, and Administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

274.0
 million.
12.
Commitments and Contingencies
Technology Related Commitments and Other

As of February 1, 2025, we have obligations under technology-related, construction and other contractual commitments in the amount of $
81.3
 million.  Of such commitments, approximately $
42.1
 million is payable in the next 12 months.
97
Financial Guarantees  
During the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide general indemnifications.  The maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against us that have not yet occurred.  However, based on experience, we believe the risk of loss to be remote.
Legal Proceedings
We are a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits, claims and demands brought by various parties relating to matters normally incident to our business.  No individual case, or group of cases against us, presenting substantially similar issues of law or fact, is expected to have a material effect on the manner in which we conduct our business or on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  The majority of these cases are alleging product, premises, employment and/or commercial liability.  Reserves have been established that we believe to be adequate based on our current evaluations and experience in these types of claim situations; however, the ultimate outcome of these cases cannot be determined at this time.  We believe, taking into consideration our indemnities, defenses, insurance and reserves, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, government agencies and self-regulatory organizations have the ability to conduct periodic examinations of and administrative proceedings regarding our business.
As previously disclosed, in May and December 2023, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) notified us that we owed additional duties relating to certain products that we imported from China that CBP believed were subject to certain anti-dumping and/or countervailing duties. While we contested CBP’s determination, we were required to deposit with CBP duties relating to these products (the “AD/CVD deposits”), which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. In January 2024, we requested a changed circumstances review of CBP’s determination by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “DOC”). In April 2024, the DOC made a determination in the Company’s favor in connection with the changed circumstances review, and in May 2024, instructed CBP to begin the process of issuing refunds to the Company on the AD/CVD deposits. In August 2024, the Company received a full refund of the AD/CVD deposits. This matter is now resolved, and the refund has been recorded as cash within cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In January 2025, the Company settled a legal matter with a third-party vendor.  In connection with this settlement, we recognized a net gain of approximately $
15.0
 million in Other (income), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income, when the gain became realizable.
We are not currently party to any other legal proceedings that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Sponsorship Agreement and Intellectual Property Commitments
We periodically enter into sponsorship agreements generally with professional sports teams, associations, events, networks or individual professional players and collegiate athletic programs in exchange for marketing and advertising promotions.  We also enter into intellectual property agreements whereby the Company receives the right to use third-party owned trademarks typically in exchange for royalties on sales.  These agreements typically contain a 
one
 to 
three-year
 term and contractual payment amounts required to be paid by the Company.  As of February 1, 2025, we have $
8.3
 million in related commitments through 2027, of which $
5.7
 million is payable in next 12 months.
13.
Employee Benefit Plans 
401(k) Plan
We sponsor a safe harbor defined contribution 401(k) profit sharing plan (the “401(k) Plan”) for our eligible employees. The 401(k) Plan includes an eligible employee compensation deferral feature, Company matching contributions and a Company profit sharing component.  Eligible employees are permitted to contribute up to 
75
% of their eligible compensation on a pretax basis to the 401(k) Plan, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations.  We match 
100
% of the money contributed by a plan participant to the 401(k) Plan each pay period, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to 
6
% of a plan participant’s eligible compensation during such pay period.  Annual Company profit sharing contributions are made at the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to certain limitations.  The 401(k) Plan may be amended or terminated at our discretion.

Segment Information
The Company’s retail operations represent one operating segment and one reportable segment, which derives revenues from customers by selling full-line sporting goods and outdoor recreational products. The Company’s retail stores and online selling channels sell similar products and services, use similar selling processes, and sell to similar classes of customers. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the products and services offered as well as business operations. The accounting policies of the Company's single reportable segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. All intercompany transactions within the single reportable segment are eliminated upon consolidation. 
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources and assesses performance at a Company level using consolidated net income, which is a GAAP measure, as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The CODM evaluates the Company's assets as reported on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The CODM evaluates significant segment expenses and makes decisions about the retail business based on the cost of goods we sell and the selling, general, and administrative expenses needed to sell those goods as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income. See the Company's consolidated financial statements included in Part IV Item 15 for more information.
