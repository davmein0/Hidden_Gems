With the exception of two retail stores which we own, we lease all of our retail stores, distribution centers and corporate offices. Our initial store lease terms are typically 15 to 20 years with various renewal options and lease escalation structures.  We believe that all of our leases are entered into at then-prevailing market lease rates.  As of February 1, 2025, our combined leased and owned store square footage was approxim
