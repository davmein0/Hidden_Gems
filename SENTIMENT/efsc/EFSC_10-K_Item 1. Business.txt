Item 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Financial Holding Company - Dividend Restrictions and Share Repurchases.” The amount of dividends, if any, that may be declared by the Company also depends on many other factors, including future earnings, bank regulatory capital requirements and business conditions as they affect the Company and its subsidiaries. As a result, no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future with respect to our common stock.

ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Introduction
The objective of this section is to provide an overview of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and other financial data presented elsewhere in this report, particularly the information regarding the Company’s business operations described in Item 1. A detailed discussion comparing 2023 and 2022 results is incorporated herein by reference to Item 7 of the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2024.
Executive Summary
Our Company offers a broad range of business and personal banking services including wealth management. Lending services include commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, real estate construction and development, residential real estate, specialty, and other loans. A wide variety of deposit products and a complete suite of treasury management and international trade services complement our lending capabilities. The Company’s results of operations are also affected by prevailing economic conditions, competition, government policies and other actions of regulatory agencies.
The Company’s financial condition, operating results and liquidity in 2024 continued to be impacted by monetary policy actions. The Federal Reserve decreased the target federal funds rate 100 basis points in the fourth quarter 2024, following a 100 basis point increase in 2023. The Federal Reserve has begun to loosen its monetary policy, but has indicated it will continue to reduce its balance sheet namely through a reduction in bond holdings. These actions represent the Federal Reserve’s response to an environment of high inflation and elevated interest rates following a period of highly expansionary fiscal support from the federal government during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021.

The Company noted the following trends during 2024:
•
The Company reported net income of $185.3 million, or $4.83 per diluted share for 2024, compared to $194.1 million, or $5.07 per diluted share for 2023. PPNR
1
 for 2024 was $255.2 million, compared to $284.8 million in 2023. PPNR ROAA
1
 for 2024 and 2023 was 1.72% and 2.06%, respectively. The decrease in PPNR
1 
and PPNR ROAA
1 
was primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits, deposit costs, and expenses incurred in connection with the core system conversion, partially offset by an increase in operating revenue. Offsetting the decrease in PPNR
1 
and PPNR ROAA
1
 was a $15.1 million decrease in the provision for credit losses in 2024 compared to 2023, due to an improvement in overall asset quality.
•
NIM decreased to 4.16% in 2024, from 4.43% in 2023, primarily due to the impact of higher interest expense on the deposit portfolio from an increase in deposit rates and average balances. The total cost of deposits was 2.12% in 2024 compared to 1.58% in 2023. Offsetting the decline in NIM was a $995.0 million increase in average interest earning assets, which resulted in total net interest income of $568.1 million, a $5.5 million increase over the prior year.

•
Noninterest income was $69.7 million, an increase of $1.0 million from $68.7 million in 2023. Noninterest expense was $385.0 million in 2024, an 11% increase from $348.2 million in 2023. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily from higher customer deposit servicing costs due to higher average balances and an increase in earnings credit rates, an increase in compensation due to the recruitment of new relationship bankers and annual merit increases, and expenses related to the core system conversion. The core efficiency ratio
1
 was 58.4% in 2024, compared to 53.4% in 2023.
•
The Company’s effective tax rate was 19.9% in 2024 compared to 21.3% in 2023.
2024 Financial Highlights
During 2024, we announced the following significant transactions:
•
The Company had a return on average assets of 1.25%. This drove a 10.1% increase in tangible book value per share in 2024.
•
Dividends paid in 2024 of $1.06 per share increased $0.06 per share, or 6%, compared to $1.00 per share in 2023. 
•
The Company repurchased 626,778 of its common shares at a weighted-average share price of $46.95.
•
In the fourth quarter 2024, the Company successfully completed the conversion of its legacy core system into a new core banking platform.
2023 Financial Highlights
During 2023, we announced the following significant transactions:
•
Dividends paid in 2023 of $1.00 per share increased $0.10 per share, or 11%, compared to $0.90 per share in 2022.
•
The process of converting to a leading core operating system was initiated.

Nontaxable income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis using a tax rate of approximately 25%.
NOTE: The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to rate and volume changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.
Net interest income (on a tax equivalent basis) was $576.5 million for 2024, compared to $570.7 million for 2023, an increase of $5.9 million. The increase in net interest income in 2024 was primarily due to a higher average yield on interest earning assets and organic loan growth, which was partially offset by an increase in the average cost paid on interest bearing liabilities. 
Total tax equivalent interest income increased $86.5 million in 2024 primarily due to a $67.0 million increase in loan interest income. The increase was primarily due to an increase in average loan balances of $665.8 million during the year. In addition, the loan yield increased 20 basis points from 6.67% in 2023 to 6.87% in 2024. Tax equivalent interest income on securities (taxable and non-taxable) in 2024 increased $14.0 million from 2023, primarily due to increases of $7.3 million in interest income on average balances and $6.7 million in yield. Average securities represented 18% of earnings assets in both 2024 and 2023. 
Overall, average interest-earning assets increased $995.0 million, or 8%, to $13.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to success in growing the deposit portfolio. The loan portfolio expanded and excess liquidity was deployed into the investment portfolio and other interest-earning assets. Volume growth of the balance sheet drove an increase in interest income on earning assets of $58.3 million, while higher loan and securities yields drove interest income on interest-earning assets up by $28.2 million in 2024 compared to 2023.
Total interest expense increased $80.6 million in 2024 primarily due to increased deposit interest expense. The increase in deposit interest expense reflects higher rates paid on deposits, as well as successful marketing efforts that

increased average deposits. Remixing of the deposit portfolio from noninterest-bearing and lower cost accounts into higher cost accounts contributed to the increase in deposit interest expense in 2024. Total average interest-bearing deposits increased to $8.5 billion, an increase of $996.3 million, or 13%, in 2024 over the average for 2023. Average noninterest-bearing deposits declined $88.8 million, or 2%, in 2024 compared to the average for 2023. Average noninterest-bearing deposits represented 31% of total average deposits in 2024, compared to 36% in 2023. Overall, average interest-bearing liabilities increased $934.9 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2024. The shift in volume from noninterest-bearing deposit accounts into higher cost deposit accounts increased interest expense in 2024 by $29.0 million, while the increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased interest expense $51.6 million in 2024.
The tax-equivalent net interest margin was 4.16% for 2024, compared to 4.43% for 2023. The primary driver of the decrease in net interest margin from 2023 to 2024 was higher interest expense on the deposit portfolio. In 2023, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates three times for a total of 100 basis points. In the fourth quarter 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target rate by 100 basis points. As of December 31, 2024, variable-rate loans comprised approximately 60% of total loans. The earning-asset yield increased 20 basis points to 6.20% in 2024, compared to 6.00% in 2023. Comparatively, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 65 basis points to 3.20%, from 2.55% in 2023.

Noninterest income increased $1.0 million, or 1%, in 2024 compared to 2023. This increase was primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in other income. Other income decreased primarily due to lower private equity and community development income ($3.1 million) and gains on the sale of SBA loans ($0.6 million), offset by an increase in gains on sale of other real estate owned ($2.9 million). Private equity and community development income are not consistent sources of income and fluctuate based on distributions and earnings from the underlying funds. In 2024, the Company sold the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans of $23.1 million for a gain of $1.4 million, compared to $42.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively, in 2023.

A non-GAAP measure.  A reconciliation has been included in this MD&A section under the caption “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
Noninterest expense increased $36.9 million, or 11%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was attributed primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits due to annual merit increases and the recruitment of new relationship bankers, a $16.4 million increase in deposit costs, and a $4.5 million increase in data processing primarily related to the core system conversion. The total cost of the core conversion in noninterest expense was $4.9 million in 2024. For certain deposit accounts in the Company’s deposit verticals, clients receive an earnings credit on average collected balances that may be used to offset expenses associated with the client’s activities for managing the accounts. These costs are reflected in noninterest expense as Deposit costs. The increase in deposit costs in 2024 is due to organic growth in the deposit verticals and an increase in market interest rates that increased the earnings credit rate and related expenses for those accounts. Average balances in the deposit verticals were approximately $3.1 billion and $2.6 billion, resulting in an average deposit vertical cost of 2.82% and 2.75% for 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company’s blended federal and state tax rate was approximately 24.8% in 2024 and 2023. The effective tax rate, which is adjusted for permanent differences, such as tax exempt income and tax credits, was 19.9% in 2024 compared to 21.3% in 2023. The effective tax rate decrease was driven by tax credit opportunities the Company has deployed as part of its tax planning strategy. See “Item 8. Note 16 – Income Taxes” for additional information.

Loans by Type
The Company has a diversified loan portfolio, with no particular concentration of credit in any one economic sector other than those noted in the table of loans by NAICS code below; however, a substantial portion of the portfolio, including the C&I category, is secured by real estate. The ability of the Company’s borrowers to honor their contractual obligations is partially dependent upon the local economy and its effect on the real estate market. 
The following table sets forth the composition of the loan portfolio by type of loans:

C&I loans are made based on the borrower’s ability to generate cash flows for repayment from income sources, general credit strength, experience, and character, even though such loans may also be secured by real estate or other assets. The credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower’s operations.
The Company continues to focus on originating high-quality C&I loan relationships as they allow for cross selling opportunities involving other banking products. Our specialized products, especially sponsor finance, life insurance premium financing, and tax credit lending, consist of primarily C&I loans, and have contributed significantly to the Company’s C&I loan growth. These loans are sourced through relationships developed with wealth and estate planning firms, private equity funds and tax credit specialists and are not bound geographically to our markets. As a result, these specialized loan products offer opportunities to expand and diversify our overall geographic concentration by entering into new markets. 
38
Real estate loans place an emphasis on the estimated cash flows from the operation of the property and/or the underlying collateral value.
•
Our commercial real estate loans, including investor-owned and owner-occupied categories, primarily represent commercial property loans on which the primary source of repayment is income from the property for investor-owned and the operating business for owner-occupied. These loans are principally underwritten based on the cash flow coverage of the property, the Company’s loan to value guidelines, and generally require either the limited or full guaranty of principal sponsors of the credit. The Company also maintains standards for amortization and maturity terms. Commercial real estate loans also represent owner-occupied C&I loans for which the primary source of repayment is dependent on sources other than the underlying collateral. In an effort to mitigate credit risk, the Company routinely reviews its loan portfolio for various concentrations. Annually, management prepares an assessment of credit risk in the various loan portfolios, with a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio subject to review. These reviews consider the Company’s collateral position as well as exposure to a given industry sector. The Company performs site visits as part of the underwriting process, in addition to stress tests for vacancy, rental and interest rates on certain property types. The Company believes that the loan portfolio is sufficiently diversified to provide protection from deterioration in any particular industry, geography or devaluation of a specific collateral type. 
•
Construction and land development loans relating primarily to residential and commercial properties, represent financing secured by real estate under development for eventual sale or undeveloped ground. At December 31, 2024, $334.2 million of these loans include the use of interest reserves and follow standard underwriting guidelines. Construction projects are monitored by the loan officer and a centralized independent loan disbursement function.
•
Residential real estate loans include residential mortgages, which are loans that, due to size or other attributes, do not qualify for conventional home mortgages available-for-sale in the secondary market, second mortgages, home equity lines and conventional mortgages that are part of a broad banking relationship with the Company. Residential mortgage loans are usually limited to a maximum of 80% of collateral value at origination.
Other loans represent loans to individuals, loans to state and political subdivisions, loans to nondepository financial institutions, and loans to purchase or are fully secured by investment securities. Credit risk is managed by thoroughly reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers prior to origination and thereafter.

The sponsor finance portfolio is primarily comprised of loans in the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors. It includes mid-market company mergers and acquisitions, targeted private equity firms, principally SBICs, and senior debt financing to portfolio companies.
The life insurance premium finance category specializes in financing whole life insurance premiums utilized in high net worth estate planning, through relationships with boutique estate planners throughout the United States.
The tax credit portfolio includes tax credit-related lending on affordable housing projects funded through the use of
federal and state low income housing tax credits. In addition, we provide leveraged and other loans on projects funded through the CDFI New Markets Tax Credit Program. This portfolio also includes tax credit brokerage through 10-year streams of state tax credits from affordable housing development funds. The tax credits are sold to clients and other individuals for tax planning purposes.
SBA loans are originated under the SBA 7(a) program and are primarily owner-occupied, commercial real estate loans secured by a 1st lien. These loans predominantly have a 75% portion guaranteed by the SBA. 
Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2024, no significant concentrations exceeding 10% of total loans existed in the Company’s loan portfolio, except as described above.

Includes loans with no stated maturity and overdraft lines of credit.
The majority of variable loans are based on the prime rate or SOFR. At December 31, 2024, $4.6 billion or 68% of variable rate loans were subject to an interest rate floor. Most variable rate loan originations have one-to three-year maturities. Management monitors this mix as part of its interest rate risk management. The Company has also entered into interest rate hedges to reduce the cash flow impact of changes in interest rates on the variable rate loan portfolio. These hedges, which include interest rate swaps and collars, had a notional amount of $400.0 million and $350.0 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See “Interest Rate Risk” of this MD&A section for additional information.

The provision for credit losses, which includes a provision for losses on unfunded commitments, is a charge to earnings to maintain the ACL at a level consistent with management’s assessment of expected losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The Company also records reversals of interest on nonaccrual loans and interest recoveries directly through the provision of credit losses. 
The CECL methodology requires economic forecasts to be factored into determining estimated losses. As a result, CECL is designed to typically require a higher level of provision at the start of an economic downturn. The decrease in the provision for credit losses in 2024 was primarily due to improved credit quality, including a reduction in net charge-offs. The higher provision for credit losses in the prior year was primarily due to loan growth, net charge-offs and the increase in nonperforming loans. The provision for credit losses in 2023 also included the impact of the impairment of an available-for-sale investment security, related to a subordinated debt security in a publicly-traded bank that failed in the first quarter of 2023.
To the extent the Company does not recognize charge-offs and economic forecasts improve in future periods, the Company could recognize a reversal of provision for credit losses. Conversely, if economic conditions and the Company’s forecast worsens, the Company could recognize elevated levels of provision for credit losses. The provision is also reflective of charge-offs in the period.

The allowance for credit losses was 1.23% of total loans at December 31, 2024, compared to 1.24%, and 1.41%, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in the allowance to total loans ratio in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to a shift in the mix of the loan portfolio to categories with lower reserve requirements, improvement in the economic forecast and net loan charge-offs of $17.5 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to generate sufficient cash or cash equivalents in a timely and cost-effective manner to meet our commitments as they become due. Typical demands on liquidity are changes in deposit levels, maturing time deposits which are not renewed, and fundings under credit commitments to customers. Funds are available from a number of sources, such as the core deposit base and loan and security repayments and maturities. 
Liquidity is provided from lines of credit with the FHLB, the Federal Reserve, and correspondent banks; the ability to acquire large and brokered deposits; sales of the securities portfolio; and the ability to sell loan participations to other banks and loans on the secondary market. These alternatives are an important part of our liquidity plan and provide flexibility and efficient execution of the asset-liability management strategy.
The Company’s Asset-Liability Management Committee oversees our liquidity position, the parameters of which are approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors. Our liquidity position is monitored daily. Our liquidity management framework includes measurement of several key elements, such as a loan to deposit ratio, a liquidity ratio, and a dependency ratio. The Company’s liquidity framework also incorporates contingency planning to assess the nature and volatility of funding sources and to determine alternatives to these sources. While core deposits and loan and investment repayments are principal sources of liquidity, funding diversification is another key element of liquidity management and is achieved by strategically varying depositor types, terms, funding markets, and instruments.
Liquidity from assets is available primarily from cash balances and the investment portfolio. Cash and interest-bearing deposits with other banks totaled $764.2 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $433.0 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in cash balances during 2024 is due to deposit growth exceeding loan growth. The 
50
increase in market interest rates in 2022 - 2023 increased the competitive environment for deposits, as depositors had more alternatives to bank deposit accounts. Successful marketing efforts increased total deposits in 2024. Investment securities are another important tool to the Company’s liquidity objectives. Securities totaled $2.8 billion at December 31, 2024, and included $1.5 billion pledged as collateral for deposits of public institutions, treasury, loan notes, and other requirements. The remaining $1.3 billion could be pledged or sold to enhance liquidity, if necessary.

The Company also has a portfolio of SBA guaranteed loans, a portion of which could be sold in the secondary market to generate earnings and liquidity. The guaranteed portion of SBA loans totaling $23.1 million and $42.1 million were sold during 2024 and 2023.
Liability liquidity funding sources are available to increase financial flexibility. In addition to amounts borrowed at December 31, 2024, the Company could borrow an additional $1.3 billion from the FHLB of Des Moines under blanket loan pledges and has additional real estate loans that could be pledged. The Company also has $2.8 billion available from the Federal Reserve Bank under a pledged loan agreement. The Company also has unsecured federal funds lines with seven correspondent banks totaling $140 million. 
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into certain forms of off-balance sheet transactions, including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. These transactions are managed through the Company’s various risk management processes. Management considers both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet transactions in its evaluation of the Company’s liquidity. The Company has $3.1 billion in unused commitments to extend credit as of December 31, 2024. While this commitment level would exhaust the majority the Company’s current liquidity resources, the nature of these commitments is such that the likelihood of funding them in the aggregate at any one time is low.
At the holding company level, our primary funding sources are dividends and payments from the Bank and proceeds from the issuance of equity (i.e. stock option exercises, stock offerings) and debt instruments. The main use of this liquidity is to provide the funds necessary to pay dividends to shareholders, service debt, invest in subsidiaries as necessary, and satisfy other operating requirements. In 2024, the holding company maintained a revolving line of credit for an aggregate amount up to $25 million, all of which was available at December 31, 2024. The line of credit had a one-year term that matured in February 2025, the interest rate was one-month Term SOFR plus 185 basis points, and an annual unused commitment fee of 0.40% was assessed. The proceeds could be used for general corporate purposes. 
Strong capital ratios, credit quality and core earnings are essential to retaining cost-effective access to the wholesale funding markets. Deterioration in any of these factors could have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to access these funding sources and, as a result, these factors are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the liquidity management process. The Bank is subject to regulations and, among other things, may be limited in its ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the parent company. Accordingly, consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available for the payment of cash dividends to the Company’s shareholders or for other cash needs.
51
Through the normal course of operations, the Company has entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments. Such obligations relate to funding operations through deposits or debt issuances, as well as leases for premises and equipment. As a financial services provider, the Company routinely enters into commitments to extend credit. While contractual obligations represent future cash requirements of the Company, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by the Company. The Company also enters into derivative contracts under which the Company either receives cash from or pays cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates. Derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date. The fair value of these contracts changes daily as market interest rates change. For additional information on the Company’s contractual obligations and commitments see the following footnotes in Item 8: “Note 5 – Leases,” “Note 6 – Derivative Financial Instruments,” “Note 10 – Subordinated Debentures and Notes,” “Note 11 – Federal Home Loan Bank Advances,” “Note 12 – Other Borrowings,” and “Note 17 – Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.” 
Capital Resources
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the state and federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements and results of operations of the Company. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and its bank affiliate must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The banking affiliate’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of total and tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of tier 1 capital to average assets. To be categorized as “well-capitalized”, banks must maintain minimum total risk-based (10%), tier 1 risk-based (8%), common equity tier 1 risk-based (6.5%), and tier 1 leverage ratios (5%). As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.

The Bank met the definition of “well-capitalized” at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Refer to “Item 8. Note 14 – Regulatory Capital” for a summary of our risk-based capital and leverage ratios. The following table summarizes the Company’s capital ratios:

Total regulatory capital includes $63.3 million of subordinated debentures that were issued in 2020 at a fixed rate of 5.75%. The interest rate on these debentures resets to a floating rate based on 3 month term SOFR plus a spread of 5.66% in June of 2025. When the interest rate resets, the debentures become callable and the inclusion in regulatory capital begins to phase out over a five year period.
The Company believes the tangible common equity and regulatory capital ratios are important measures of capital strength. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio is considered a non-GAAP measure. The tables included in this MD&A section under the caption “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” reconcile these ratios to U.S. GAAP. 
Risk Management
Market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates and other relevant market rate or price risk. The Company faces market risk in the form of interest rate risk through transactions other than trading activities. Market risk from these activities, in the form of interest rate risk, is measured and managed through a number of methods. The Company uses financial modeling techniques to measure interest rate risk. These techniques measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing interest rate environments. Guidelines established by the Bank’s Asset/Liability Management Committee and approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors are used to monitor exposure of earnings at risk. General interest rate movements are used to develop sensitivity as management believes it has no primary exposure to a specific point on the yield curve. These limits are based on the Company’s exposure to immediate and sustained parallel rate movements, either upward or downward. The Company does not have any direct market risk from commodity exposures.
Interest Rate Risk

Our interest rate risk management practices are aimed at optimizing net interest income, while guarding against deterioration that could be caused by certain interest rate scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity varies with different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We attempt to maintain interest-earning assets, comprised primarily of both loans and investments, and interest-bearing liabilities, comprised primarily of deposits, maturing or repricing in similar time horizons in order to manage any impact from market interest rate changes according to our risk tolerance. The Company uses an earnings simulation model to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates. 
The Company determines the sensitivity of its short-term future earnings to a hypothetical plus or minus 100 to 300 basis point parallel rate shock through the use of simulation modeling. The simulation of earnings includes the modeling of the balance sheet as an ongoing entity. Future business assumptions involving administered rate products, prepayments for future rate-sensitive balances, and the reinvestment of maturing assets and liabilities are included. These items are then modeled to project net interest income based on a hypothetical change in interest rates. The resulting net interest income for the next 12-month period is compared to the net interest income amount calculated using flat rates. This difference represents the Company’s earnings sensitivity to a positive or negative parallel rate shock.
53
The following table summarizes the projected impact of interest rate shocks on net interest income:

In addition to the rate shocks shown in the table above, the Company models net interest income under various dynamic interest rate scenarios. In general, changes in interest rates are positively correlated with changes in net interest income. 
The Company occasionally uses interest rate derivative instruments as an asset/liability management tool to hedge mismatches in interest rate exposure indicated by the net interest income simulation described above. They are used to modify the Company’s exposures to interest rate fluctuations and provide more stable spreads between loan yields and the rate on their funding sources. At December 31, 2024, the Company had derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk, including $400.0 million in notional value on derivatives to hedge the cash flows on floating rate loans and $32.1 million in notional value on derivatives on floating rate debt. Derivative financial instruments are discussed in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6 – Derivative Financial Instruments.”
The FCA ceased publishing the most common USD LIBOR settings (overnight, 1-month. 3-month, 6-month and 12-month) after September 30, 2024. LIBOR was the most liquid and common interest rate index in the world and was commonly referenced in financial instruments. With the cessation of LIBOR, the Company has selected term SOFR as the replacement index for the majority of its variable rate loans and began providing customer notifications in early 2023. The Company ceased using LIBOR and ICE swap rates in new contracts and began issuing SOFR based loans in December 2021.
The Company had $6.7 billion in variable rate loans as of December 31, 2024. Of these loans, $4.6 billion have an interest rate floor and nearly all of those loans were at or above the floor. Variable rate loans include $2.7 billion indexed to the prime rate, $3.2 billion are indexed to SOFR, and $807.4 million indexed to other rates.
Changes in interest rates will also have an effect on noninterest expense. Certain deposit accounts receive an earnings credit that provides a reimbursement for costs clients incur on the accounts. As interest rates increase, the amount available for reimbursement also increases, resulting in an increase to noninterest expense. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates would reduce the amount available for reimbursement and decrease noninterest expense.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The following accounting policies are considered most critical to the understanding of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. These critical accounting policies require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Because these estimates and judgments are based on current circumstances, they may change over time or prove to be inaccurate based on experience. In the event different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, and depending upon the severity of such changes, the possibility of a materially different financial condition and/or results of operations could reasonably be expected. The impact and any associated risks related to our critical accounting policies on our business operations are described throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a detailed 
54
discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see “Item 8. Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
The Company has prepared all of the consolidated financial information in this report in accordance with GAAP. The Company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using loss experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods. There can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company maintains separate allowances for funded loans, unfunded loans, and held-to-maturity securities, collectively referred to as the ACL. The ACL is a valuation account to adjust the cost basis to the amount expected to be collected, based on management’s experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. For purposes of determining the allowance for funded and unfunded loans, the portfolios are segregated into pools that share similar risk characteristics that are then further segregated by credit grades. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis and are not included in the collective evaluation. The Company estimates the amount of the allowance based on loan loss experience, adjusted for current and forecasted economic conditions, including unemployment, changes in GDP, and commercial and residential real estate prices. The Company’s forecast of economic conditions uses internal and external information and considers a weighted average of a baseline, upside, and downside scenarios. Because economic conditions can change and are difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated loan defaults and losses, and therefore the adequacy of the allowance, could change significantly and have a direct impact on the Company’s credit costs. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on loans was $138.0 million at December 31, 2024 based on the weighting of the different economic scenarios. As a hypothetical example, if the Company had only used the upside scenario, the allowance would have decreased $27.7 million. Conversely, the allowance would have increased $47.4 million using only the downside scenario.
Income Taxes
Management uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable for the current year, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and income tax expense. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance may be established. We consider the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy because of the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets, including projections of future taxable income. These judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required in the future if the amounts of taxes recoverable through loss carry backs decline, if we project lower levels of future taxable income, or we project lower levels of tax planning strategies. Such valuation allowance would be established through a charge to income tax expense that would adversely affect our operating results.
Effects of New Accounting Pronouncements
See “Item 8. Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Recent Accounting Pronouncements” for information on recent accounting pronouncements and their impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.
55
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company’s accounting and reporting policies conform to U.S. GAAP and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, the Company provides other financial measures, such as core efficiency ratio, tangible common equity ratio, return on average tangible common equity, and tangible book value per common share, in this report that are considered “non-GAAP financial measures.” Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
The Company considers its core efficiency ratio, tangible common equity ratio, return on average tangible common equity, and tangible book value per common share, collectively “core performance measures,” presented in this earnings release and the included tables as important measures of financial performance, even though they are non-GAAP measures, as they provide supplemental information by which to evaluate the impact of certain non-comparable items, and the Company’s operating performance on an ongoing basis. Core performance measures exclude certain other income and expense items, such as core conversion expenses, FDIC special assessment, merger-related expenses, facilities charges, and the gain or loss on sale of other real estate owned and investment securities, that the Company believes to be not indicative of or useful to measure the Company’s operating performance on an ongoing basis. The attached tables contain a reconciliation of these core performance measures to the GAAP measures. The Company believes that the tangible common equity ratio provides useful information to investors about the Company’s capital strength even though it is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and is not part of the regulatory capital requirements to which the Company is subject.
The Company believes these non-GAAP measures and ratios, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures and ratios, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance and capital strength. The Company’s management uses, and believes investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP measures and ratios in assessing the Company’s operating results and related trends and when forecasting future periods. However, these non-GAAP measures and ratios should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or preferable to, ratios prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company has provided a reconciliation of, where applicable, the most comparable GAAP financial measures and ratios to the non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, or a reconciliation of the non-GAAP calculation of the financial measure for the periods indicated.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Enterprise Financial Services Corp
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Enterprise Financial Services Corp and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans — Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method to measure the Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”) on loans collectively evaluated that are sub-segmented by credit risk levels. The DCF method incorporates assumptions for probability of default, loss given default, prepayments and curtailments over the contractual term of the loans. In determining the probability of default, the Company utilized a regression analysis to determine certain economic factors that are relevant loss drivers in the portfolio segments based on historical or peer evaluations. Additionally, the Company applies qualitative adjustments to address risks not directly captured in the quantitative reserve; including to address macroeconomic uncertainty by weighting the forecasted baseline, upside, and downside economic factors.
61
We identified the ACL on loans as a critical audit matter because of the complexity of the Company’s model and the significant assumptions used by management. Auditing the ACL on loans required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve credit specialists when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s models and assumptions. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
Our audit procedures related to the Company’s ACL on loans included the following, among others: 
•
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of management’s controls covering the key data, assumptions, and judgments impacting the ACL on loans. 
•
We evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s accounting policies, methodologies, and elections involved in determining the ACL on loans. 
•
We involved credit specialists to assist us in evaluating the Company’s development of the ACL model, including the selection of and calibration to economic factors. 
•
We assessed the reasonableness of the Company’s qualitative methodology, tested key calculations utilized within the qualitative estimate, and agreed underlying data within the calculation to source documents.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Enterprise Financial Services Corp
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Enterprise Financial Services Corp and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ENTERPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES CORP AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1 - 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies used by the Company in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are summarized below.
Business and Consolidation
Enterprise is a financial holding company that provides a full range of banking and wealth management services to individuals and corporate customers primarily located in Arizona, California, Florida, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, and New Mexico, and SBA loan and deposit productions offices throughout the country through its banking subsidiary, Enterprise Bank & Trust. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
The Company and its banking subsidiary are subject to the regulations of various federal and state agencies and undergo periodic examinations by those regulatory agencies. The Company has 
one
 operating segment.

Use of Estimates
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions, which significantly affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Such estimates include the valuation of loans, goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets, along with assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.

Cash Flow Information
For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold that mature within 90 days to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash balances include deposits in transit and drafts in the process of collection. The Federal Reserve is authorized to establish reserve requirements on depository institutions. In 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the reserve requirement to zero percent. As such, cash balances at the Federal Reserve at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not subject to a reserve requirement.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
FASB ASU 2022-03, 
Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions.

ASU 2022-03 was issued in June 2022 to (1) clarify the guidance in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security, (2) amend a related illustrative example, and (3) introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with Topic 820. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2022-03 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
FASB ASU 2023-02, 
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method
. 
ASU 2023-02 was issued in March 2023 to allow reporting entities to consistently account for equity investments made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits and other income tax benefits. If certain conditions are met, a reporting entity may elect to account for its tax equity investments by using the proportional amortization method regardless of the program from which it receives income tax credits, instead of only low-
70
income-housing tax credit (“LIHTC”) structures. This amendment also eliminates certain LIHTC-specific guidance aligning the accounting with other equity investments in tax credit structures. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2023-02 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
FASB ASU 2023-07, 
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. 
ASU 2023-07 was issued in November 2023 to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment disclosures. The amendments in this update require annual and interim disclosures on significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and require annual and interim disclosures on “other segment items” that comprise the difference between segment revenue less segment expense compared to the reported measure of segment profit or loss. In addition, the amendments will require all annual disclosures that are currently required to be reported on an interim basis and requires disclosure of the title and position of the chief operating decision maker and how that position uses the information to assess segment performance and the allocation of resources. ASU 2023-07 also requires entities that have a single reportable segment, such as the Company, to provide all disclosures required in this update and the existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
FASB ASU 2023-09, 
Income Tax Disclosures
. 
ASU 2023-09 was issued in December 2023 to require annual disclosures on specific categories in the income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. Annual disclosures are required on income taxes paid, including the amounts paid for federal, state and foreign taxes and the amount paid in individual jurisdictions if the amount is equal to or greater than 5% of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). Additional annual disclosures are required on pre-tax income from continuing operations and income tax expense, disaggregated by domestic and foreign amounts. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is evaluating the accounting and disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-09 and does not expect them to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Investments
The Company has classified all investments in debt securities as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
Securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a net amount as a separate component of shareholders’ equity until realized. All previous fair value adjustments included in the separate component of shareholders’ equity are reversed upon sale.
Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.
An ACL on held-to-maturity securities is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the securities to reflect the expected amount to be collected. When it is determined a security will not be collected, the balance is written-off through the allowance. In evaluating the need for an ACL, securities with similar risk characteristics are grouped and an estimate of expected cash flows is determined using loss experience, adjusted for current and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions.
For available-for-sale securities in a loss position, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost resulted from a credit loss or other factors. Losses attributed to credit are recognized through an ACL on available-for-sale securities, limited to the amount that the fair value of securities is less than the amortized cost basis. In assessing credit loss, the Company considers, among other things, (1) the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, (2) adverse conditions specific to the security or industry, (3) historical payment patterns, (4) the likelihood of future payments, and (5) changes to the rating of a security by a rating agency.
71
The Company has elected to exclude accrued interest receivable balances from the estimate of the ACL as these amounts are timely written off as a credit loss expense. Adjustments to the ACL on held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the expected lives of the respective securities as an adjustment to yield using the interest method. Dividend and interest income is recognized when earned. Realized gains and losses are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.
Loans Held-for-Sale and Servicing Assets
The Company provides long-term financing of 1-4 family residential real estate by originating fixed and variable rate loans. Long-term fixed and variable rate loans are usually sold into the secondary market with limited recourse. Upon receipt of an application for a real estate loan, the Company determines whether the loan will be sold into the secondary market or retained in the Company’s loan portfolio. The interest rates on the loans sold are locked with the buyer and the Company bears no interest rate risk related to these loans. Mortgage loans held-for-sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, which is determined on a specific identification method. The Company does not retain servicing on these loans.
The Company also originates SBA 7(a) loans that generally provide for a guarantee of 75% of the loan, up to a maximum amount. The guaranteed portion of the loan can be sold in an active secondary market. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, all SBA7(a) loans are considered held-for-investment; however, as the Company makes the determination to sell the loans, they will be moved into the held-for-sale category. Sales of SBA guaranteed loans are executed on a servicing retained basis, and the Company retains the rights and obligations to service the loans. At December 31, 2024, the Company was servicing SBA loans that had been sold and has recorded a related servicing asset of $
2.3
 million. The servicing asset is accounted for under the amortization method and is evaluated for impairment. Amortization of the servicing asset is recorded as a reduction to servicing income.
Gains on the sale of held-for-sale loans are reported net of direct origination fees and costs in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.
Loans 
Loans are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of unearned fees, costs, and premiums or discounts on acquired loans. Loan origination fees, direct origination costs, and premiums or discounts resulting from acquired loans are deferred and recognized over the lives of the related loans as a yield adjustment using the interest method. 
Interest on loans is accrued to income based on the principal balance outstanding. The recognition of interest income is typically discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due or a significant deterioration in the borrower’s credit has occurred which, in management’s judgment, negatively impacts the collectibility of the loan. Unpaid interest on such loans is reversed at the time the loan becomes uncollectible and subsequent interest payments received are generally applied to principal if any doubt exists as to the collectibility of such principal. Loans that have not been restructured are returned to accrual status when management believes full collectibility of principal and interest is expected. Non-accrual loans that have been restructured will remain in a non-accrual status until the borrower has made at least six months of consecutive contractual payments.
The Company has elected to present the accrued interest receivable balance separate from amortized cost basis, to exclude accrued interest receivable balances from the tabular disclosures, and not to estimate an ACL on accrued interest receivable as these amounts are timely written off as a credit loss expense.
Accrued interest receivable totaled $
52.4
 million and $
66.7
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were reported in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
72
Acquired Loans 
Acquired loans are separated into two categories based on the credit risk characteristics of the underlying borrowers as either PCD, for loans which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination, or loans with no credit deterioration (non-PCD). At the date of acquisition, an ACL on PCD loans is determined and added to the amortized cost basis of the individual loans. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. The ACL on PCD loans is recorded in the acquisition accounting and no provision for credit losses is recognized at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the ACL are recorded through provision expense. For non-PCD loans, an ACL is established immediately after the acquisition through a charge to the provision for credit losses.
The ACL for both PCD and non-PCD is determined by pooling loans with similar risk characteristics and using the approach described below under “Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans.”
Non-accrual Loans 
Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments. Additionally, whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectability of principal or interest on loans, it is management’s practice to place such loans on non-accrual status immediately, rather than delaying such action until the loans become 90 days past due. Previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed. Income is recorded only to the extent a determination has been made that the principal balance of the loan is collectible and the interest payments are subsequently received in cash, or for a restructured loan, the borrower has made six consecutive contractual payments. If collectibility of the principal is in doubt, payments received are applied to loan principal. 
Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing interest are also generally included in nonperforming loans. Loans past due 90 days or more but still accruing are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured (the collateral value covers principal and accrued interest) and in the process of collection. 
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
The ACL on loans is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when management deems the loan uncollectible. 
Management estimates the allowance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant factors.
The ACL on loans is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company has identified the following portfolio segments:
C&I
 – C&I loans consist of loans to small and medium-sized businesses in a wide variety of industries. These loans are generally collateralized by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, real estate and other commercial assets, and may be supported by other credit enhancements such as personal guarantees. Risk arises primarily due to a difference between expected and actual cash flows of the borrower. However, the recoverability of these loans is also dependent on other factors primarily dictated by the type of collateral securing these loans. The fair value of the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate as market conditions change. Included within C&I are revolving loans supported by borrowing bases that fluctuate depending on the amount of underlying collateral. A portion of C&I loans consists of sponsor finance, which are loans with senior debt exposure to private equity backed companies.
CRE
 – CRE loans include various types of loans for which the Company holds real property as collateral. Commercial real estate lending activity is typically restricted to owner-occupied properties or to investor properties 
73
that are owned by customers with a current banking relationship. The primary risks of CRE loans include the borrower’s inability to pay, material decreases in the value of the real estate being held as collateral and significant increases in interest rates, which may make the real estate mortgage loan unprofitable. Real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets and in the general economy. 
Construction and Land Development 
– The Company originates loans to finance construction projects including 1-4 family residences, multifamily residences, commercial office, and industrial projects. Construction loans are generally collateralized by first liens on the real estate and have floating interest rates. Construction loans are considered to have higher risks due to construction completion and timing risk, and the ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property and the availability of long-term financing. Additionally, economic conditions may impact the Company’s ability to recover its investment in construction loans. Adverse economic conditions may negatively impact the real estate market which could affect the borrowers’ ability to complete and sell the project. Additionally, the fair value of the underlying collateral may fluctuate as market conditions change. 
Residential Real Estate
 – The Company originates loans to finance one- to four-family residences, secured by both first and second liens. Repayment of these loans is dependent on the borrowers’ ability to pay and the fair value of the underlying collateral. Residential loans with a second lien are inherently riskier due to the junior lien position.
Agricultural
 – Agricultural loans are generally secured with equipment, livestock, crops or other non-real property and at times the underlying real property. Agricultural loans are primarily included as a component of CRE and C&I loans. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has ceased originating new agricultural credit relationships.
Consumer
 – The Company provides a broad range of consumer loans to customers, including personal lines of credit, credit cards, recreational vehicles, yachts and automobile loans. Repayment of these loans is dependent on the borrowers’ ability to pay and the fair value of the underlying collateral. Consumer loans are included as a component of Other loans.
The Company utilizes a DCF method to measure the ACL on loans collectively evaluated that are sub-segmented by credit risk levels. The DCF method incorporates assumptions for probability of default, loss given default, prepayments and curtailments over the contractual term of the loans. In determining the probability of default, the Company utilized regression analysis to determine certain economic factors that are relevant loss drivers in the portfolio segments based on historical or peer evaluations. National unemployment is a loss driver used in all portfolios. The annual percentage change in gross domestic product is used in Construction, Agricultural, and Consumer portfolios. The annual percentage change in a commercial real estate index, national house price index and national retail sales are used in the CRE, Residential Real Estate and C&I portfolios, respectively. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless the extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.
The Company uses a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast that considers baseline, upside and downside economic scenarios. For periods beyond the forecast period, the Company reverts to historical loss rates on a straight-line basis over a one-year period.
Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not also included in the collective evaluation. When management determines foreclosure is probable, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs. Other individually-evaluated loans may be remeasured using a discounted cash flow method if appropriate. Non-accrual loans, loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing, unless adequately secured and in the process of collection, and restructured loans are evaluated individually.
74
Loan Charge-Offs
Loans are charged-off when the primary and secondary sources of repayment (cash flow, collateral, guarantors, etc.) are less than their carrying value and the amounts are deemed uncollectible.

Other Real Estate and Repossessed Assets
Other real estate represents property acquired through foreclosure or deeded to the Company in lieu of foreclosure on loans on which the borrowers have defaulted on the payment of principal or interest. Other real estate is initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell and subsequently at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. The fair value of other real estate is based upon estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets, if available, or independent appraisals. These estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments. As a result, fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or settlement of the other real estate. Gains, losses and writedowns resulting from the writedown or sale of other real estate are credited or charged to earnings. 
Gains and losses resulting from the sale of other real estate are credited or charged to current period earnings. Costs of maintaining and operating other real estate are expensed as incurred, and expenditures to complete or improve other real estate properties are capitalized if the expenditures are expected to be recovered upon ultimate sale of the property.
Repossessed assets represent property, other than real estate, that is acquired through repossession and is initially recorded at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition, less costs to sell. Subsequent to repossession, the assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
Fixed Assets
Buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. All categories are computed using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives. Furniture, fixtures and equipment is depreciated over 
three
 to 
ten years
 and buildings and leasehold improvements over 
ten
 to 
forty years
, based upon estimated lives or lease obligation periods.
State Tax Credits 
The Company has purchased the rights to receive 
10-year
 streams of state tax credits at agreed upon discount rates and sells such tax credits to its clients and others. State tax credits are accounted for at cost. The Company is also a minority partner in a joint venture, accounted for as an equity method investment, that purchases state income tax credits for resale to customers. Income from both the sale of state tax credits and earnings from the joint venture are reported as tax credit income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance
The Company has purchased bank-owned life insurance policies on certain bank officers. Bank-owned life insurance is recorded at its cash surrender value. Changes in the cash surrender values, including death benefits in excess of the carrying amount, are included in noninterest income.
Federal Home Loan Bank Stock
The Bank, as a member of the FHLB, is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB. The stock is redeemable at par by the FHLB, and is, therefore, carried at cost and periodically evaluated for impairment. The Company records FHLB dividends in interest income.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the Company may not be able to recover the respective asset’s carrying amount. The Company’s annual test for impairment was performed as of December 31, 2024. Such tests involve the use of estimates and assumptions. 
Potential impairments to goodwill must first be identified by performing a qualitative assessment which evaluates relevant events or circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If this test indicates it is more likely than not that goodwill has been impaired, then 
75
a quantitative impairment test is completed. The quantitative impairment test calculates the fair value of the reporting unit and compares it with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair market value, an impairment loss is recognized. That loss is equal to the carrying amount of goodwill that is in excess of its implied fair market value.
Core deposit intangibles are amortized using an accelerated method over an estimated useful life of approximately 
10
 years.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as fixed assets and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held-for-sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to assist in managing interest rate sensitivity and to modify the repricing, maturity and option characteristics of certain assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company also offers an interest rate hedge program that includes interest rate swaps to assist its customers in managing their interest rate risk profile. In order to eliminate the interest rate risk associated with offering these products, the Company enters into derivative contracts with third parties to offset the customer contracts. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative instruments are required to be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated financial statements. Fair value represents the payment the Company would receive or pay if the item were sold or bought in a current transaction. The accounting for changes in fair value (gains or losses) of a hedged item is dependent on whether the related derivative is designated and qualifies for “hedge accounting.” The Company assigns derivatives to one of these categories at the purchase date: cash flow hedge, fair value hedge, or non-designated hedges as part of a customer interest-rate swap product. An assessment of the expected and ongoing hedge effectiveness of any derivative designated a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge is performed as required by the applicable accounting standards. Derivatives are included in 
other assets
 and 
other liabilities
 in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and the fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim or obligation to return cash collateral are not offset when represented under a master netting arrangement. Generally, the only derivative instruments used by the Company have been interest rate swaps, collars, forward currency contracts, and interest rate caps.  
Certain derivative financial instruments are not designated as cash flow or as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. These non-designated derivatives are intended to provide interest rate protection on net interest income or noninterest income but do not meet hedge accounting treatment. Customer accommodation interest rate swap contracts are not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in interest income or noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income depending on the underlying hedged item.
Income Taxes
The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances is based on a more-likely-than-not 
76
standard. The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient positive taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the laws for each applicable taxing jurisdiction. The following possible sources of taxable income are considered: future reversal patterns of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carryback years and the availability of qualified tax planning strategies. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted depends on all available positive and negative factors including, but not limited to, nature, frequency, and severity of recent losses, duration of available carryforward periods, experience with tax attributes expiring unused and near and medium term financial outlook. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions regarding the estimated amounts of accrued taxes.

Share-Based Compensation 
Share-based compensation is recognized as an expense for stock options, restricted stock awards, performance stock units, and restricted stock units granted to employees and directors in return for service. Equity classified awards are measured at the grant date fair value using either an observable market value or a valuation methodology, and are recognized over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur. A description of the Company’s share-based employee compensation plan is included in “Note 15 - Shareholders’ Equity and Compensation Plans.”

Deposit Verticals
The Company offers a deposit vertical platform to customers in certain industries, primarily community associations, property management, and legal industry and escrow services. These customers will typically receive an earnings credit rate on average collected balances that is used to offset their cost of maintaining the deposit accounts. Earnings credits, otherwise referred to as Deposit costs, are reflected as a component of non-interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions and business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The assets and liabilities of the acquired entities have been recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets.
The purchase price allocation process requires an estimation of the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. When a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of the combination contingent on future events, the Company includes an estimate of the acquisition-date fair value as part of the cost of the combination. To determine the fair values, the Company relies on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. The results of operations of the acquired business are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Merger-related expenses include costs directly related to merger or acquisition activity and include legal and professional fees, system consolidation and conversion costs, and compensation costs such as severance and retention incentives for employees impacted by acquisition activity. The Company accounts for merger-related expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.
For divestitures, the Company measures an asset (disposal group) classified as held-for-sale at the lower of its carrying value at the date the asset is initially classified as held-for-sale or its fair value less costs to sell. The Company reports the results of operations of an entity or group of components that either has been disposed of or held-for-sale as discontinued operations only if the disposal of that component represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results.
Any incremental direct costs incurred to transact the sale are allocated against the gain or loss on the sale. These costs include items such as legal fees, title transfer fees, broker fees, etc. Any goodwill and intangible assets 
77
associated with the portion of the reporting unit to be disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining the gain or loss on the sale.
Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share data is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Common shares outstanding include common stock and restricted stock awards where recipients have satisfied the vesting terms. Diluted earnings per common share gives effect to all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.

Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
The Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income includes the amount and the related tax impact that have been reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income. The classification adjustment for unrealized loss/gain on sale of securities included in net income has been recorded through the gain on sale of investment securities line item, within noninterest income, in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

Share Repurchases
The Company periodically adopts share repurchase plans that authorize open market repurchases of common stock. Shares acquired through the repurchase plan are classified as treasury stock or the shares are immediately retired upon settlement, depending on plan authorization. When shares are retired, the excess of repurchase price over par is allocated between additional paid in capital and retained earnings. The amount allocated to additional paid in capital is limited to the pro rata portion of additional paid in capital at the time of repurchase.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts, including deposit costs and other noninterest expense, reported in prior periods in the “Consolidated Statements of Income,” and “Note 20 – Supplemental Financial Information,” have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on net income or shareholders’ equity.
NOTE 2 - 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per common share data is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.

The Company believes the held-to-maturity category is consistent with the Company’s intent for these securities. The Company did 
not
 transfer any securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity in 2024 or 2023. The balance of held-to-maturity securities in the “Amortized Cost” column in the table above includes a cumulative net unamortized, unrealized gain of $
10.8
 million and $
14.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such amounts are amortized over the remaining life of the securities. 
79
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no holdings of securities of any one issuer in an amount greater than 
10
% of shareholders’ equity, other than the U.S. Government agencies and sponsored enterprises. The agency mortgage-backed securities are all issued by U.S. Government agencies and sponsored enterprises. Securities of $
1.5
 billion and $
1.6
 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure deposits of public institutions and for other purposes as required by law or contract provisions, in addition to collateral securing borrowing bases with the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank.
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities at December 31, 2024, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. The weighted average life of the mortgage-backed securities is approximately

The unrealized losses at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, were primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates since the securities were purchased. In 2023, an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale investment securities was established through a provision for credit losses of $
4.2
 million. A debt security of $
4.2
 million was subsequently charged-off against that allowance. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was 
no
 ACL on available-for-sale securities outstanding. 
Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity debt securities totaled $
8.6
 million and $
6.5
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is excluded from the estimate of expected credit losses. The estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the ACL on held-to-maturity securities was $
0.3
 million and $
0.8
 million, respectively.
The proceeds, gross gains and losses realized from sales of available-for-sale investment securities were as follows:

8.7
 million, and $
7.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is recorded at cost, which represents redemption value, and is included in other investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The remaining amounts in other investments primarily include various investments in SBICs, CDFIs, and the Company’s investment in unconsolidated trusts used to issue preferred securities to third parties, see “Note 10 – Subordinated Debentures and Notes.”

The CECL methodology incorporates various economic scenarios. The Company utilizes three forecasts in the model; Moody’s baseline, a stronger near-term growth upside and a moderate downside forecast. The Company weights these scenarios at 
40
%, 
30
%, and 
30
%, respectively, which added approximately $
14.8
 million to the ACL over the baseline model at December 31, 2024. The forecasts at the end of 2024 incorporate an expectation that the federal funds rate will continue to fall in 2025. The Company has also recognized various risks posed by loans in certain segments, including the commercial office sector, by allocating additional reserves to those segments. Some of the key risks to the forecasts that could result in future provision for credit losses are market reactions to the Federal Reserve policy actions that could push the economy into a recession, persistently higher inflation (including the impact of tariffs), tightening in the credit markets, and further weakness in the financial system.
In addition to the CECL methodology, the Company incorporates qualitative adjustments into the ACL on loans to capture credit risks inherent within the loan portfolio that are not captured in the DCF model. Included in these risks are 1) changes in lending policies and procedures, 2) actual and expected changes in business and economic conditions, 3) changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, 4) changes in lending management, 5) changes in volume and the severity of past due loans, 6) changes in the quality of the loan review system, 7) changes in the value of underlying collateral, 8) the existence and effect of concentrations of credit and 9) other factors such as the regulatory, legal and competitive environments and events such as natural disasters and pandemics.

At December 31, 2024, the ACL on loans included a qualitative adjustment of $
44.3
 million. Of this amount, $
14.5
 million was allocated to Sponsor Finance loans due to their unsecured nature.

The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company uses a probability of default and loss given default model to determine the allowance for credit losses. 
86
An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. The effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance. 
The most common concession the Company provides to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is a term extension. In limited circumstances, the Company may modify loans by providing principal forgiveness or an interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the asset is written off against the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses.
In some cases, the Company will modify a loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as an interest rate reduction or principal forgiveness, may be granted. 
The following tables show the recorded investment at the end of the dates listed for loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, disaggregated by loan class and type of concession granted:

There were no loans that experienced a default during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 subsequent to being granted a modification in the preceding twelve months. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company allocated an immaterial amount in specific reserves to loans that have been restructured.
The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as current financial information, payment experience, credit documentation, and current economic factors among other factors. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:
•
Grades 1, 2, and 3 –
 Includes loans to borrowers with a continuous record of strong earnings, sound balance sheet condition and capitalization, ample liquidity with solid cash flow, and whose management team has experience and depth within their industry.
•
Grade 4 –
 Includes loans to borrowers with positive trends in profitability, satisfactory capitalization and balance sheet condition, and sufficient liquidity and cash flow.
•
Grade 5 –
 Includes loans to borrowers that may display fluctuating trends in sales, profitability, capitalization, liquidity, and cash flow.
•
Grade 6 –
 Includes loans to borrowers where an adverse change or perceived weakness has occurred, but may be correctable in the near future. Alternatively, this rating category may also include circumstances where the borrower is starting to reverse a negative trend or condition, or has recently been upgraded from a 7, 8, or 9 rating.
•
Grade 7 – Special Mention
 credits are borrowers that have experienced financial setback of a nature that is not determined to be severe or influence ‘ongoing concern’ expectations. Although possible, no loss is anticipated, due to strong collateral and/or guarantor support.
89
•
Grade 8
 – 
Substandard
 credits include those borrowers characterized by significant losses and sustained downward trends in balance sheet condition, liquidity, and cash flow. Repayment reliance may have shifted to secondary sources. Collateral exposure may exist and additional reserves may be warranted.
•
Grade 9
 – 
Doubtful
 credits include borrowers that may show deteriorating trends that are unlikely to be corrected. Collateral values may appear insufficient for full recovery, therefore requiring a partial charge-off, or debt renegotiation with the borrower. The borrower may have declared bankruptcy or bankruptcy is likely in the near term. All doubtful rated credits will be on non-accrual.

NOTE 6 - 
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives
The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s loans and borrowings. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest income and expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
For hedges of the Company’s variable-rate loans, interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of fixed amounts and the Company making variable rate payments. The Company has executed cash flow hedges to reduce a portion of variability in cash flows on the Company’s prime based loan portfolio. Select terms of the hedges are as follows:

The Company executed a prime based interest rate collar in the fourth quarter of 2022 with a notional amount of $
100.0
 million. The collar includes a cap of 
8.14
% and a floor of 
5.25
%. The collar matures on October 1, 2029. The Company also executed a 1-month SOFR based interest rate collar in the fourth quarter of 2024 with a notional amount of $
50.0
 million. The collar includes a cap of 
4.21
% and a floor of 
3.23
%. The collar matures on November 1, 2029. These transactions are commonly referred to as zero cost collars, which involves the Company selling an interest rate cap where payments will be made when the index exceeds the cap rate, and the purchase of a floor where payments will be received if the index falls below the floor. 
For hedges of the variable-rate liabilities, interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The Company has executed a series of cash flow hedges to fix the effective interest rate for payments due on $
32.1

junior subordinated debentures to a weighted-average-fixed rate o

The gain or loss on derivatives designated and qualified as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into interest income or expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income or expense as interest payments are paid on the Company’s variable-rate loans and debt. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates $
0.6
 million will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense and $
1.2
 million will be reclassified as a decrease to interest income. 
Non-designated Hedges 
Derivatives not designated as hedges are not considered speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting derivatives the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings as a component of other noninterest income.

The Company has 
13
 unconsolidated statutory business trusts. These trusts issued preferred securities that were sold to third parties. The sole purpose of the trusts was to invest the proceeds in junior subordinated debentures of the Company that have terms identical to the trust preferred securities. The subordinated debentures, which are the sole assets of the trusts, are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all present and future senior and subordinated indebtedness and certain other financial conditions of the Company. The Company fully and unconditionally guarantees each trust’s securities obligations. Under current regulations, the trust preferred securities are included in tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes, subject to certain limitations.
The trust preferred securities are redeemable in whole or in part on or after their respective call dates. Mandatory redemption dates may be shortened if certain conditions are met. The securities are classified as subordinated debentures in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Interest on the subordinated debentures held by the trusts is recorded as interest expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company’s investment in these trusts of $
2.9
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023 is included in other investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has fixed the interest rate on a portion of its junior subordinated debentures through a 
100
series of interest rate swaps. For further discussion of the interest rate swaps and the corresponding terms, see “Note 6 – Derivative Financial Instruments.”
On May 21, 2020, EFSC issued $
63.3
 million of 
5.75
% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due in 2030 in a public offering (the “2030 Notes”). From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding, June 1, 2025, the 2030 Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to 
5.75
% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on each June 1 and December 1. From and including June 1, 2025 to, but excluding, the maturity date or the date of earlier redemption, the 2030 Notes will bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to a benchmark rate (which is expected to be three-month term SOFR (as defined in the Indenture, dated May 21, 2020, between EFSC and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, and subsequent First Supplemental Indenture)), plus 
566.0
 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2025. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in event that the benchmark rate is less than zero, then the benchmark rate shall be deemed to be zero. The Company’s obligation to make payments of principal and interest on the notes is subordinate and junior in right of payment to all of its senior debt. Current regulatory guidance allows for this subordinated debt to be treated as tier 2 regulatory capital for the first five years of its term, subject to certain limitations, and then phased out of tier 2 capital pro rata over the next five years.

NOTE 11 - 
FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK ADVANCES
FHLB advances are collateralized by 1-4 family residential real estate loans, business loans, and certain commercial real estate loans. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the unpaid principal of the loans pledged to the FHLB of Des Moines was $
2.6
 billion and $
1.9
 billion, respectively. The loans are pledged to the secured line of credit to maintain the borrowing base, which had availability of approximately $
1.3
 billion and $
1.0
 billion

at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company did not have any FHLB advances at December 31, 2024 or 2023.
NOTE 12 - 
OTHER BORROWINGS
Securities Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase
The Company enters into sales of securities under agreements to repurchase. The agreements are transacted with deposit customers and are utilized as an overnight investment product. The amounts received under these agreements represent short-term borrowings and are reflected as a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The securities underlying these agreements are included in investment securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has no control over the market value of the securities, which fluctuates due to market conditions. However, the Company is obligated to promptly transfer additional securities if the market value of the securities falls below the repurchase agreement price. The Company manages this risk by maintaining an unpledged securities portfolio that it believes is sufficient to cover a decline in the market value of the securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
A summary of securities sold under agreements to repurchase is as follows:

2.8
 billion and $
2.5
 billion, respectively, was available under this line. This line was secured by a pledge of certain eligible loans and securities aggregating $
3.2
 billion and $
2.9
 billion, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Included in the line at December 31, 2023 was $

Other Borrowings 
The Company had $
36.2
 million of borrowings from various entities related to New Market Tax Credit investments at December 31, 2024 and 2023. These notes have remaining terms that range from 
24
-
29
 years. These notes have an interest rate of 
1.0
% and are generally interest only for the first 
7
 years. 
Revolving Credit Line
In February 2016, the Company entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Agreement”) with another bank. The Revolving Agreement had a 
one-year
 term that matured on February 22, 2025, allowed for borrowings up to $
25
 million, and had an interest rate of one-month Term SOFR plus 
185
 basis points until February 2025. A fee of 
0.40
% annually was assessed against the unused commitment. The proceeds could be used for general corporate purposes. The Revolving Agreement was subject to ongoing compliance with a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as specified financial covenants. The revolving credit line was not accessed in 2024 or 2023.
Term Loan
In February 2019, the Company entered into a 
five year
, $
40.0
 million unsecured term loan agreement (the “Term Loan”) with another bank with the proceeds primarily used to fund the company’s cash portion of an acquisition in 2019. The interest rate was one-month LIBOR plus 
125
 basis points until February 2022. In February 2022, the interest rate on the Term Loan was amended to one-month Term SOFR plus 
136
 basis points. The term loan agreement matured in February 2024 and was not renewed.

NOTE 13 - 
LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES 
The Company, from time to time, is a party to various legal proceedings arising out of its businesses. Management believes there are no such legal proceedings pending or threatened against the Company in the ordinary course of business, directly, indirectly, or in the aggregate that, if determined adversely, would have a material adverse effect on the business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

NOTE 14 - 
REGULATORY CAPITAL
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum ratios (set forth in the following table) of total, tier 1, and common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of tier 1 capital to average assets. Management believes, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, that the Company met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
102
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bank was categorized as “well-capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as “well-capitalized” the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based capital, tier 1 risk-based capital, common equity tier 1 risk-based capital, and tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. In addition, the Company must maintain an additional CCB above the regulatory minimum ratio requirements. The CCB is designed to insulate banks from periods of stress and impose constraints on dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonus payments when capital levels fall below prescribed levels.

Common Stock Repurchase Plan
In May 2022, the Company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 
two million
 shares of the Company’s common stock. The repurchases may be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions and the stock repurchase program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. At December 31, 2024, there were 
1,373,222
 shares available for repurchase under the plan.
Preferred Stock
The Company has 
5,000,000
 shares of authorized preferred stock with a par value of $
0.01
 with 
75,000
 shares issued and outstanding at the end of 2024 and 2023. The Board of Directors has the right to set for each series of preferred stock, subject to the laws of the State of Delaware, the dividend rate, conversion and redemption terms, voting rights and liquidation preferences, among others. In the fourth quarter 2021, the Company issued and sold 
3,000,000
 depositary shares, each representing 1/40th interest in a share of the Company’s 
5
% Noncumulative, Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (“Series A Preferred Stock”), totaling $
72.0
 million, net of issuance costs. The depositary shares trade under the ticker “EFSCP”. The Series A Preferred Stock may be redeemed at the Company’s option, subject to prior regulatory approval, in whole or in part on any dividend payment date on or after December 15, 2026 or within 90 days following a regulatory capital event, as defined in the offering documents. If any Series A Preferred Stock are redeemed, a proportionate number of depositary shares will also be redeemed.
Dividends
The Company’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is generally dependent upon the payment of dividends by the Bank to the parent company. The Bank cannot pay dividends to the extent it would be deemed undercapitalized by the FDIC after making such dividend. 
Preferred stock dividends, when and if declared by the board of directors, are payable, quarterly in arrears, on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. If dividends on the Series A Preferred stock have not been declared or paid in six quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors on the board will automatically be increased by two and the holders of the Series A preferred stock will be entitled to vote for the additional directors. Quarterly dividends have been declared and paid in all periods since the preferred stock was issued.
104
Dividends on the Company’s capital stock are prohibited under the terms of the junior subordinated debenture agreements, see “Note 10 – Subordinated Debentures and Notes,” if the Company is in continuous default on its payment obligations to the capital trusts, has elected to defer interest payments on the debentures or extends the interest payment period. Furthermore, unless dividends on all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period have been paid or declared, dividends on, and repurchases of, common stock is prohibited. At December 31, 2024, the Company was not in default on any of the junior subordinated debenture issuances or preferred stock.

Compensation Plans
The Company has adopted share-based compensation plans to reward and provide long-term incentive for directors and key employees of the Company. These plans provide for the granting of stock, stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and may contain performance terms for key employees as designated by the Company’s Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board. The Company uses authorized and unissued shares to satisfy share award exercises. 
The total excess income tax benefit for share-based compensation arrangements was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2024, and $
0.3
 million and $
0.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2024, there was $
14.0
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average term of approximately 
one year

The Company has entered into long-term incentive agreements with certain key employees. These awards are conditioned on certain performance criteria and market criteria measured against a group of peer banks over a 
three-year
 period for each grant. The awards contain minimum (threshold), target, and maximum (exceptional) performance levels. In the event of a change in control, as defined in the plan, the awards will vest at least at the target level. The amount of the awards is determined at the end of the 
three-year
 vesting and performance period. The fair value of performance units issued upon vesting in 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $
2.6
 million, $
1.6

Stock Options 
In determining compensation cost for stock options, the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value on date of grant. The model utilizes several assumptions in its calculations. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant. The expected term of options granted is based on the option's vesting schedule and expected exercise patterns and represent the period of time options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock and expected term of the option. The dividend yield is determined by annualizing the dividend rate as a percentage of the Company's stock price. 
The following weighted average assumptions were used for grants issued during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

As part of an acquisition in 2019, the company acquired net operating loss, tax credit, and capital loss deferred tax assets. Net operating losses originated in the years 2012, 2014-2017, and 2019 and will expire in the years between 2032-2037. Tax credit carryforwards originated in years 2010-2015 and will expire in the years between 2030-2035. 
A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the assets will not be realized. The company determined it was more likely than not that some of the acquired net operating loss and tax credit assets would not be realized and has recognized a valuation allowance of $
2.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the federal jurisdiction and in thirty-one states and localities. The Company is no longer subject to federal, state or local income tax audits by tax authorities for years before 2019, with the exception of 2016 and 2017 being open years by state taxing authorities. Net operating losses generated prior to 2016 that are utilized going forward would still be subject to examination.
As of December 31, 2024, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $
5.0
 million and the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, was $
4.0
 million compared to $
2.4
 million and $
2.2
 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company believes it is 
110
reasonably possible the gross amount of unrecognized benefits will be reduced by approximately $
0.3
 million as a result of a lapse of statute of limitations in the next 
12
 months. The Company is under audit by the state of California, Missouri, and Texas, and while the Company has concluded it has adequately provided for uncertain tax positions, the outcome of such audits are always uncertain and could result in additional tax expense, though immaterial.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense and classifies such interest and penalties in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The amount accrued for interest and penalties was $
2.1
 million as of 2024, $
1.0
 million as of 2023, and $
0.6
 million as of 2022.

NOTE 17 - 
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Long-term Lease Commitments
See “Note 5 – Leases” in this report for information regarding the Company’s long-term lease commitments.
Off-balance-Sheet Commitments
The Company issues financial instruments in the normal course of the business of meeting the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments may involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s extent of involvement and maximum potential exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is not more than the contractual amount of these instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for financial instruments included on its consolidated balance sheets. 
The contractual amounts of off-balance-sheet financial instruments are as follows:

There was an insignificant amount of unadvanced commitments on impaired loans at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Other liabilities include an allowance for credit losses on unadvanced commitments of $
6.1
 million and $
6.6
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments usually have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, may have significant usage restrictions, and may require payment of a fee. Of the total commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, $
156.5
 million and $
191.6
 million, respectively, represent fixed rate loan commitments. Since certain of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon or may be revoked, the 
111
total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash obligations. The Company evaluates each customer’s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, premises and equipment, and real estate. 
Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These letters of credit are issued to support contractual obligations of the Company’s customers. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as the risk involved in extending loans to customers. The approximate remaining term of letters of credit range from 
one month
 to 
3
 years at December 31, 2024.
The Company also has off-balance sheet commitments for purchases of tax credits and commitments for various capital raises for limited partnership investments
.
NOTE 18 - 
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The fair value of an asset or liability is the exchange price that would be received to sell that asset or paid to transfer that liability in an orderly transaction occurring in the principal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) for such asset or liability. Inputs to valuation techniques include the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,
 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: 

•
Level 1 Inputs
 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
•
Level 2 Inputs
 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means. 
•
Level 3 Inputs
 - Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.

•
Securities available-for-sale
. Fair values for available-for-sale securities are based upon dealer quotes, market spreads, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond’s terms and conditions at the security level. Changes in fair value are recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income.
113
•
Derivatives
. Derivatives are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The Company obtains counterparty quotations to value its interest rate swaps and caps. In addition, the Company validates the counterparty quotations with third-party valuation sources. Derivatives with negative fair values are included in Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Derivatives with positive fair value are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of client-related derivative instruments are recognized through net income. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the gains and losses substantially offset each other due to the Company’s hedging of the client swaps with other bank counterparties.
Fair value on a non-recurring basis
Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). 
•
Individually-evaluated loans
. On a quarterly basis, fair value adjustments are recorded as necessary on loans that no longer exhibit risk characteristics similar to other loans to account for (1) partial write-downs based on the current appraised or market-quoted value of the underlying collateral or (2) the full charge-off of the loan carrying value. In some cases, the properties for which market quotes or appraised values have been obtained are located in areas where comparable sales data is limited, outdated, or unavailable. In addition, the Company may adjust the valuations based on other relevant market conditions or information. Accordingly, fair value estimates, including those obtained from real estate brokers or other third-party consultants, for collateral-dependent loans are classified in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Fair value estimates on individually-evaluated loans utilizing a discounted cash flow approach are also classified as Level 3. 
•
Other real estate.
 These assets are initially reported at fair value, less cost to sell, and subsequently at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is based on third party appraisals of each property and the Company’s judgment of other relevant market conditions. These are considered Level 3 inputs. 
The following tables present financial instruments and non-financial assets still held as of the reporting date measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Such estimates include the valuation of loans, goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets, along with assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate. Changing real estate values, illiquid credit markets, volatile equity markets, and changes in consumer spending have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods. In addition, these estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale the Company’s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument at one time. Fair value estimates are based on existing on-balance and off-balance-sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains 
115
and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in many of the estimates.

NOTE 21 - 
SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company has determined it has 
one
 operating and reportable segment. The economic characteristics, including the nature, the type or class of customer, and the nature of the regulatory environment of the products, services and business lines of the Company are all similar. The Company provides a full range of banking services, including mortgage, tax credit brokerage, wealth management and traditional banking services, to individuals and corporate customers. Refer to “Item 8. Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for the accounting policies of the Company. 
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the chief executive officer. The operating results that are regularly reviewed by the CODM are the consolidated results of the Company. The CODM uses the consolidated results of the Company in deciding whether to reinvest profits into the segment or into other parts of the entity, such as for acquisitions or to pay dividends. The CODM assesses performance for the segment and decides how to allocate resources based on net income, reported on the income statement as consolidated net income. The CODM is provided with the consolidated financial statement package on a monthly basis.
The Company considered the following factors, among others, in determining significant segment expenses: the magnitude of the expense item and its relevance to the segment’s performance, the variability and volatility of the expense item, and whether the expenses are used by the CODM. The Company’s significant segment revenues and expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM, including the Company’s profit or loss, have been included within the primary financial statements and notes thereto.  Refer to “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements” and “Item 8. Note 20 - Supplemental Financial Information” for these figures.

ITEM 9: CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the “Act”) as of December 31, 2024. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Act). The Company’s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or untimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. 
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial reporting. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of any system of internal control may vary over time. The design of any internal control system also factors in resource constraints and consideration for the benefit of the control relative to the cost of implementing the control. Because of these inherent limitations in any system of internal control, management cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud within the Company have been detected. 
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management has concluded that the Company maintained an effective system of internal control over financial reporting based on these criteria as of December 31, 2024. 
The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, who audited the consolidated financial statements, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, and it is included herein. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm."
119
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
The Company completed the conversion of its legacy core system into a new core banking platform. This upgrade included enhancements to the loan and deposit areas, as well as digital banking and the general ledger, among others. The conversion was completed October 11, 2024 and, as a result, there were certain changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting to align with the new system functionality and updated processes.
There have been no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Act) that occurred during the Company’s quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
