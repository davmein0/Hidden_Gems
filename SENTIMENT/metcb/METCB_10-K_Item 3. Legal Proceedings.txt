PART II
Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Shareholder Matters
On June 12, 2023, an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation was approved by shareholder vote to reclassify the Company’s existing common stock as shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and create a separate Class B common stock having a par value of $0.01 per share. 
The initial distribution of Class B common stock occurred on June 21, 2023 via a stock dividend to existing holders of common stock as of May 12, 2023. On the date of initial distribution, each holder of common stock received 0.2 shares of Class B common stock for every one share of existing common stock held on the record date.
Market Information. 
Our Class A and Class B common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbols “METC” and “METCB,” respectively. Our 9.00% Senior Notes due 2026 (the Senior Notes due 2026) and 8.375% Senior Notes due 2029 (the Senior Notes due 2029) are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbols “METCL” and “METCZ,” respectively.
Holders.

As of the close of business on February 28, 2025, there were 72 holders of record of our Class A common stock and 75 holders of record of our Class B common stock. Because many of our common shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these holders of record.
Dividends.

The Company declared a mix of cash and non-cash dividends to its shareholders during 2024. The Company declared $19.1 million of total cash dividends during 2024, which includes $12.1 million to Class A shareholders, and $6.2 million to Class B shareholders and $0.8 million of forfeitable dividends subject to the vesting conditions of outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company declared $12.7 million of non-cash dividends to Class A shareholders, totaling $12.0 million of Class B common shares and $0.7 million of Class B forfeitable dividend equivalent units. Lastly, during the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company declared $2.2 million of non-cash dividends to Class B shareholders, which included $2.1 million of Class B common shares and $0.1 million of Class B forfeitable dividend equivalent units. The number of Class B common shares and units is determined based on the closing price of Class B stock on the record date for each non-cash dividend declared.
Dividends to holders of Class A common stock were declared in the total amount of approximately $0.55 per share during 2024 ($0.1375 per quarter). Dividends to holders of Class B common stock were declared in the total amount of approximately $0.94 per share during 2024 ($0.22 - $0.24 per quarter). All dividends declared for holders of Class B common stock were based on 20% of CORE royalty and infrastructure fees for the previous quarter.
Subsequent to the date of the financial statements, the Company declared an additional quarterly cash dividend for holders of Class B common stock in February 2025, in the amount of $0.1971 per share of Class B common stock, which is payable on March 14, 2025, to shareholders of record on February 28, 2025. In addition, on March 17, 2025, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $0.06875 per share of Class A common stock, which will be paid in Class B common stock on June 13, 2025 to Class A shareholders of record on May 30, 2025. The number of shares of Class B common stock to be distributed will be determined based on the closing price of Class B common stock on May 30, 2025.
The Company anticipates distributing quarterly dividends at similar per-share amounts in the future; however, it is currently unknown whether cash or non-cash dividends will be declared for Class A and Class B shareholders in future periods, as future declarations of dividends are subject to Board of Directors’ approval and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. In addition, the Board of Directors retains the power to change or add expense allocation policies related to CORE, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine CORE’s per-ton usage fees at any time without shareholder approval.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition and contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. We caution you that our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors,” all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.
Overview
Our primary source of revenue is the sale of metallurgical coal. We are a pure-play metallurgical coal company with 66 million reserve tons and 1,352 million measured and indicated resource tons of high-quality metallurgical coal. Our plan is to continue development of our existing properties and grow annual production over the next few years to approximately seven million clean tons of metallurgical coal, subject to market conditions, permitting and additional capital deployment in the medium-term. We may make acquisitions of reserves or infrastructure that continue our focus on advantaged geology and lower costs.
The overall outlook of the metallurgical coal business is dependent on a variety of factors such as pricing, regulatory uncertainties, and global economic conditions. Coal consumption and production in the U.S. are driven by several market dynamics and trends including the U.S. and global economies, the U.S. dollar’s strength relative to other currencies and accelerating production cuts. Blast furnace steelmaking is more prevalent outside the U.S. compared to domestic steel production, which creates demand for exports of metallurgical coal, including demand growth in Asia Pacific. 
Global metallurgical coal markets softened in 2024 due to constrained economic growth in some regions of the world and continued conflict overseas. The global steel market experienced slower growth, especially in China, resulting in elevated levels of Chinese steel exports. These conditions have led steel companies to both cut back on their own production and to reduce the price they are willing to pay for their metallurgical coal feedstock. For 2025, overall steel demand will likely remain weak in the near term; however, supply cuts may occur for higher cost operations absent a significant upward movement in pricing. Longer term, the Company believes that limited global investment in new coking coal production capacity, the industrialization of emerging economies, expansion of urbanization globally, and an eventual return to economic growth will support coking coal markets overall.
We sold 4.0 million tons of coal during 2024 compared to 3.5 million tons during 2023. North American markets made up 33% of our revenues and export markets, excluding Canada, accounted for 67% of our revenues for 
77

Table of Contents
both 2024 and 2023. Export sales often contain index-based pricing and, therefore, greater volatility in pricing and revenues.
The metallurgical coal markets are volatile in nature; therefore, the Company prioritizes managing its financial position and liquidity, while managing costs and capital expenditures and returning value to its shareholders.
In 2024, our total capital expenditures were $68.8 million, excluding capitalized interest of $1.5 million. In 2023, our capital expenditures were $82.9 million, excluding capitalized interest of $1.1 million. The decrease in capital expenditures was due to the Company’s progress related to strategic growth projects.
​
The Company produced 3.7 million tons during 2024 compared to 3.2 million tons during 2023 as a result of the increase in capacity and completed development work. The Company expects full-year production volumes in 2025 between 4.2 and 4.6 million tons with an ability to vary production dependent on market conditions.
​
While the Company normally pays cash dividends on a quarterly basis, the Company paid dividends in the fourth quarter of 2024 to both Class A and Class B shareholders in the form of Class B stock. This decision was based on the Company’s goal of returning value to its shareholders while maintaining the Company’s commitment to prioritize liquidity and financial optionality as we move into 2025. 
​
The Company continues to assess its potential rare earth elements and critical minerals deposit in Wyoming. Analysis performed to date indicates elevated levels of rare earth elements along with significant concentrations of critical minerals gallium and germanium, which were banned for export to the United States by China on December 2, 2024. The Company hopes to complete its techno-economic analysis of the overall commercial aspects of the potential opportunity and begin construction of a pilot processing facility in mid to late 2025. The Company recently received a $6.1 million matching grant from the Wyoming Energy Authority, which will be applied toward development of the pilot plant and related facilities at the Brook Mine.
No revenues have been recognized from the Company’s Wyoming initiatives.

​
Net income and Adjusted EBITDA were lower in 2024 compared to 2023, despite the increase in sales volume, due to the decrease in metallurgical coal price indices. This occurred due to a variety of macroeconomic factors including the Chinese oversupply of steel during 2024. In addition, net income and Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 benefitted from $15.9 million of pre-tax income for proceeds received from insurance claims related to the 2022 Berwind ignition and 2018 silo failure. Refer to 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Year Ended December 31, 2024 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023
Our revenue includes sales to customers of Company-produced coal as well as smaller amounts of coal purchased from third parties. We include amounts billed by us for transportation to our customers within revenue and transportation costs incurred within cost of sales.

Revenue
. Coal sales revenue for full-year 2024 was $666.3 million, approximately 4% lower than 2023, despite the increase in tons sold, due to the negative impact of pricing. The 15% increase in tons sold occurred in both North America and export markets, with export volumes increasing by 18% and North America volumes increasing by 10%. The volume increase was aided by the Company’s increased capacity for production achieved during late 2023. Revenue per ton sold decreased 17% from $201 per ton for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $167 per ton for year ended December 31, 2024 and was driven by the variability in index-based pricing for export sales. Revenue per ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation revenues and demurrage, decreased 18% from $170 per ton for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $140 per ton for the year ended December 31, 2024. Refer to 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 later in Item 2 for more information regarding this measure. U.S. metallurgical coal price indices have fallen by roughly 32% on a year-to-date basis driven by the macroeconomic conditions discussed previously. We expect metallurgical coal prices to remain volatile in the near term.
Refer to Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Concentrations and Note 11—Revenues in Item 8, Part II for additional information regarding sales to customers.
Cost of sales. 
Our cost of sales totaled $533.3 million for full-year 2024, approximately 8% higher than 2023, due to the increase in tons sold discussed above. Cost of sales per ton sold decreased 6% from $143 per ton in 2023 to $134 per ton in 2024. Cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation costs, alternative mineral development costs, and idle mine costs, decreased 5% from $110 per ton in 2023 to $105 per ton in 2024. Mine costs for 2024 were impacted negatively by challenging geology and labor constraints in the first quarter of 2024 but improved thereafter due to efficiencies gained from increased production compared to 2023.
Asset retirement obligation accretion
. ARO accretion was $1.5 million for 2024 and was nearly flat versus 2023.
Depreciation, depletion, and amortization
. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense totaled $65.6 million in 2024 compared to $54.3 million in 2023. The increase in 2024 was due to the increases in plant and equipment and production versus 2023. The increase in 2024 also included $1.1 million of additional amortization of capitalized development for the Knox Creek Jawbone mine, which occurred due to the closure of the mine during 2024.
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses
. SG&A expenses were $49.3 million for 2024 compared to $48.8 million for 2023. SG&A expenses in 2024 include a $3.9 million benefit accrued for the probable

recovery of previously incurred attorney fees related to silo failure litigation developments, which is not indicative of future SG&A expenses. This matter offset most of the 2024 increase in stock-based compensation compared to 2023.
Other income (expense), net.
 Other income, net was $4.4 million in 2024 compared to $18.3 million in 2023. The activity in 2024 was primarily related to the $2.2 million recovery of previously incurred demurrage and other transportation-related matters, a $1.2 million lost coal recovery claim, and an actuarial gain of $0.5 million associated with the Company’s occupational disease benefit obligation. The activity in 2023 was related mostly to insurance proceeds received in 2023 related to the 2022 Berwind ignition event that occurred in 2022 and the silo failure that occurred in 2018. The Company received proceeds of $17.0 million during 2023 and had accrued a recovery asset of $1.1 million in the previous period; thus, a gain of $15.9 million was recognized in 2023. This activity is not indicative of expected future results.
Interest expense, net. 
Interest expense, net was approximately $6.1 million in 2024 as compared to $8.9 million in 2023. The decrease in net interest expense in 2024 was primarily due to the repayment of debt associated with the previous acquisitions of Ramaco Coal and Maben Coal. 
Income tax expense. 
We recognized income tax expense of $3.7 million and $22.4 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lower amount in 2024 was largely due to the decrease in income before taxes. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an explanation of differences versus the statutory rate of 21%.
Year Ended December 31, 2023 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022
Please see 
Part I, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA. 
Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance.
We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus net interest expense; stock-based compensation; depreciation, depletion, and amortization expenses; income taxes; accretion of asset retirement obligations; and, when applicable, certain non-operating items (income tax penalties and charitable contributions). A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is included below. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to serve as a substitute to U.S. GAAP measures of performance and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.

Non-GAAP revenue per ton sold. 
Non-GAAP revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) is calculated as coal sales revenue less transportation revenues and demurrage, divided by tons sold. We believe revenue per ton (FOB mine) provides useful information to investors as it enables investors to compare revenue per ton we generate against similar measures made by other publicly-traded coal companies and more effectively monitor changes in coal prices from period to period excluding the impact of transportation costs which are beyond our control. The adjustments made to arrive at these measures are significant in understanding and assessing our financial performance. Revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute to revenue under U.S. GAAP.

Non-GAAP cash cost per ton sold. 
Non-GAAP cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine) is calculated as cash cost of sales less transportation costs, alternative mineral development costs, and idle and other costs, divided by tons sold. We believe cash cost per ton sold provides useful information to investors as it enables investors to compare our cash cost per ton against similar measures made by other publicly-traded coal companies and more effectively monitor changes in coal cost from period to period excluding the impact of transportation costs which are beyond our control. The adjustments made to arrive at these measures are significant in understanding and assessing our financial performance. Cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine) is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute to cost of sales under U.S. GAAP.

2025 Sales Commitments
As of December 31, 2024, we had entered into forward sales contracts for approximately 1.5 million tons to North American customers at an average fixed price of $152 per ton, excluding freight, 0.1 million tons to export

Table of Contents
customers at an average fixed price of $145 per ton, excluding freight, and 1.4 million additional tons to export customers priced against various benchmark indices. The Company expects to satisfy approximately 98% of these commitments in 2025 and the remainder in 2026. Sales commitments of another 0.5 million tons were obtained subsequent to December 31, 2024.
The annual contracting season with North American steel producers generally occurs in late-summer through the fall. As stated above, we had entered into forward sales contracts with certain North American customers at an average fixed price of $152 per ton, excluding freight, as of December 31, 2024. This is lower than the average fixed price of $166 per ton, excluding freight, that was obtained during the previous contracting season for North America. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary source of cash is proceeds from the sale of our coal production to customers. Our primary uses of cash include the cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, acquisitions, royalty payments, and other operating expenditures.

Cash flows provided by operating activities during 2024 decreased $48.4 million versus the prior year driven by lower cash earnings. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were favorable on a net basis versus the prior year, which was driven by receivables collections and was largely due to fluctuations in fourth quarter revenues for 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Net cash used for investing activities during 2024 decreased slightly by $1.4 million versus the prior year primarily due to lower capital expenditures of $14.1 million offset partially by $11.2 million of insurance proceeds received in 2023 related to previous investments. The decrease in capital expenditures was due to the Company’s continued progress related to strategic growth projects and, therefore, the need for less growth capital expenditures. The $11.2 million of insurance proceeds received during 2023 related to property, plant, and equipment claims from the 2022 Berwind ignition event and 2018 silo failure. 
Net cash used for financing activities was $31.7 million lower in 2024 versus 2023, which was driven by debt-related activities. The Company repaid $38.2 million more acquisition-related financing in 2023 compared to 2024. In addition, the Company issued new senior notes during 2024 resulting in net cash proceeds of $55.2 million and paid off its outstanding revolver borrowings from 2023 in the amount of $42.5 million while continuing to pay down its finance leases and equipment loans. Equity-related activities, in total, were nearly flat year to year despite the Company’s declaration of non-cash dividends to its Class A and Class B shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2024 as discussed earlier. The Company began paying cash dividends on Class B common stock during the third quarter of 2023 shortly after the initial distribution discussed below.  
​
On June 21, 2023, the Company distributed Class B common stock, a tracking stock, to provide existing holders of the Company’s common stock an opportunity to participate directly in the financial performance of the Company’s CORE assets on a stand-alone basis, separate from the Company’s metallurgical coal operations. CORE assets were acquired initially by the Company as part of the Company’s acquisition of Ramaco Coal in the second quarter of 2022. The financial performance of CORE assets consists of the following non-cost-bearing revenue streams based on the Company’s current expectations:
83

Table of Contents
●
Royalty fees derived from the royalties associated with the Ramaco Coal and Amonate reserves, which we believe approximates 3% of Company-produced coal sales revenue excluding coal sales revenue from Knox Creek,
●
Infrastructure fees based on $5.00 per ton of coal processed at our preparation plants and $2.50 per ton of loaded coal at the Company’s rail load-out facilities, and
●
Future income derived, if and when realized, from rare earth elements, critical minerals, and advanced carbon products initiatives.
​
Dividends paid on the tracking stock allow the Company to return to Class B common stockholders a portion of the savings from royalties and infrastructure usage fees resulting from the acquisition of Ramaco Coal. In addition, the tracking stock provides an opportunity for Class B common stockholders to participate directly in the potential revenue growth associated with the development of carbon products and rare earth elements. Separate financial statements for CORE have not been included as exhibits to this filing since CORE’s financial performance and dividends will be evaluated based on non-cost-bearing revenue streams, at least initially, and other potential forms of passive income rather than reduced by allocated costs and expenses.
​
All cash dividends declared to date for Class B common stock were based on 20% of CORE royalty and infrastructure fees for the previous quarter.

​
 The Company anticipates distributing quarterly dividends at similar per-share amounts in the future; however, it is not known at this time whether the Company will declare additional non-cash and/or stock dividends to Class A and Class B shareholders in future periods. Future declarations of dividends are subject to Board of Directors’ approval and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.
​
Restricted cash balances at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were both $0.8 million and consisted of funds held in escrow for potential future workers’ compensation claims. Restricted cash balances were included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

Please see Part I, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company’s cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.
Indebtedness
At December 31, 2024, we had $92.4 million of outstanding debts, or $88.6 million net of unamortized issuance costs. Our indebtedness was comprised of $92.0 million of senior note debt ($88.1 million net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs) and $0.4 million of various equipment loans. Of these amounts, $0.4 million is contractually due in 2025.
The Company’s outstanding debt decreased slightly by $1.6 million in 2024 as repayments of revolver borrowings, acquisition-related debt, and equipment loans were nearly offset by new senior note debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2024. Revolver borrowings, which are typically used for the management of our normal operating cash position, were repaid in full at December 31, 2024. The Company has also repaid in full all financing related to its previous acquisitions of Ramaco Coal and Maben Coal. 
The Company completed a debt offering of $57.5 million, in the aggregate, of the 8.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2029 (the “Senior Notes due 2029”). The Company incurred transaction-related fees of $2.3 million and third-party debt issuance costs of $0.8 million (including a small portion not yet funded at December 31, 2024). These notes mature on November 30, 2029, unless redeemed prior to maturity. The Senior Notes due 2029 bear interest at a rate of 8.375% per annum, which is payable quarterly in arrears. The proceeds, net of transaction fees and debt issuance costs, are for general corporate purposes, including funding future investments, making capital expenditures, and funding working capital.
The acquisition of Ramaco Coal helps to reduce royalty expenses associated with the Company’s metallurgical operations in the Appalachian basin and, along with the acquisition of Maben Coal, complement our existing low-volatile portfolio, both of which help achieve the Company’s objective of remaining among the lowest cost producers of metallurgical coal in the U.S. In addition, the acquisition of Ramaco Coal includes potential concentrations of rare earth elements and is being used to support the Company’s possible expansion into the manufacture and commercialization of advanced carbon products and materials from coal, both of which provide additional growth opportunities in the future. 
In addition to the debts discussed above, the Company finances the payment of premiums associated with various insurance policies. The Company’s liability at December 31, 2024 was $4.3 million, which must be repaid in 2025.
The Company also has various finance leases for mining equipment, which generally include terms from three to five years. The Company’s total liability for finance leases at December 31, 2024 was $13.7 million, which includes $6.2 million due in 2025 and $7.5 million due thereafter.
Refer to Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on indebtedness and leases.
Liquidity
The metallurgical coal markets are volatile in nature; therefore, the Company prioritizes managing its financial position and liquidity, while managing costs and capital expenditures and returning value to its shareholders.
On May 3, 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment Agreement to the Second Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement in order to, among other things, extend the maturity date and increase the size of its existing Revolving Credit Facility. The amended facility has a maturity date of May 3, 2029, and provides an initial aggregate revolving commitment of $200 million as well as an accordion feature to increase the size by an additional $75 million subject to certain terms and conditions, including the lenders’ consent. The amended facility provides the Company with additional flexibility to pursue further growth in production while meeting normal operating

Table of Contents
requirements. The terms of the amended facility also require the Company to maintain certain covenants, including fixed charge coverage ratio and compensating balance requirements. Borrowings under the amended facility may not exceed the borrowing base as determined under the amended formula included in the agreement.
At December 31, 2024, we had $33.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $104.8 million of remaining availability under our Revolving Credit Facility for future borrowings. Cash and cash equivalents include $7.5 million of compensating balances held in dedicated accounts to assure future credit availability under the revolver. The Company is party to an arrangement that began in 2023 whereby our cash and cash equivalents are placed at various banks in amounts no greater than the $250,000 FDIC-insured limit to help safeguard against potential losses in the financial sector. The Company’s total current assets were $167.6 million and were in excess of total current liabilities by $45.2 million as of the balance sheet date.

The terms of the Revolving Credit Facility include covenants limiting the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, incur liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, and enter into transactions with affiliates. The terms of the facility also require the Company to maintain certain covenants, including fixed charge coverage ratio and compensating balance requirements. A fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10:1.00, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, must be maintained by the Company. In addition, the Company must maintain an average daily cash balance of $5.0 million, as determined on a monthly basis, in a dedicated account as well as an additional $1.5 million and $1.0 million in separate dedicated accounts to assure future credit availability. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.
​
As stated earlier, our primary use of cash includes capital expenditures for mine development, infrastructure, and equipment as well as ongoing operating expenses. As of the date of this Annual Report, we expect to fund our capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months and the reasonably foreseeable future with cash on hand, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, and projected cash flows from operations. Factors that could adversely impact our future liquidity and ability to carry out our capital expenditure program include the following:
●
Timely delivery of our product by rail and other transportation carriers;
●
Late payments of accounts receivable by our customers;
●
Cost overruns in our purchases of equipment needed to complete our mine development plans;
●
Delays in completion of development of our various mines, processing plants and refuse disposal facilities, which would reduce the coal we would have available to sell and our cash flow from operations; and
●
Adverse changes in the metallurgical coal markets that would reduce the expected cash flow from operations.
​
If future cash flows were to become insufficient to meet our liquidity needs or capital requirements, due to changes in macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, we may reduce our expected level of capital expenditures for new mine production and/or fund a portion of our capital expenditures through the issuance of debt or equity securities, new debt arrangements, or from other sources such as asset sales. 
On September 1, 2023, the Company filed a shelf registration statement to sell any combination of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, and rights at an aggregate initial offering price of up to $400.0 million, which was declared effective on September 29, 2023. The shelf registration was utilized in part for the issuance of senior note debt in the fourth quarter of 2024 as discussed above.
Working Capital
Accounts receivable were $73.6 million at December 31, 2024, which declined $23.3 million versus December 31, 2023 driven by the $31.8 million decrease in fourth quarter revenues year over year. Inventories were $43.4 million at December 31, 2024, which were $6.2 million higher versus December 31, 2023 driven by increased production. Accounts payable were $48.9 million at December 31, 2024, down slightly from December 31, 2023 due in part to variations in spending.
86

Table of Contents
Capital Requirements
During 2024 we spent $68.8 million for capital additions, including $13.6 million related to the preparation plant and expansion of our Maben Complex, compared to $82.9 million during 2023. The decrease in 2024 was due largely due to the substantial progress made by the Company in achieving its initiatives to grow production. 
We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $60-70 million in 2025, which includes roughly $20 million of growth capital relating to increasing the per annum production run-rate at the Elk Creek Complex and increasing production at the Berwind mine.

Minimum royalties represent the contractual minimum amounts to be paid monthly, quarterly or annually for

the right to access mineral properties and mine certain reserves and resources. The amounts are generally recoupable against future production royalties to be paid. 
Refer to the previous discussion of 
Indebtedness
 above for additional information regarding the Company’s outstanding debt, insurance financing, and finance leases. Leases payments in the table above include payments for both financing and operating leases.
Take-or-pay obligations represent those liquidated damage obligations as determined by contract volume minimums for transportation of coal at the representative rates of transportation or a portion thereof. Additional take-or-pay commitments are currently in negotiation and are not reflected in the table above.
Asset retirement obligations have been excluded from the table above. Accounting for asset retirement obligations requires a number of estimates, including the amount and timing of payments to satisfy the obligation. The total liability recognized on the Company’s balance sheet for asset retirement obligations was $31.1 million at December 31, 2024. Refer to 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 below as well as Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Estimated payments related to worker’s compensation and occupational disease obligations have also been excluded from the table above. Refer to 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 below for additional information related to these obligations. Refer also to 
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for additional information related to accrued expenses and other liabilities.
​
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations, or 
87

Table of Contents
cash flows to result from these arrangements. We primarily use surety bonds to secure our financial obligations related to reclamation and other matters. Total surety bonds at December 31, 2024, were $32.3 million.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses reported for the period then ended.
Coal Reserves
. Our coal reserves and resources are generally updated on an annual basis. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of coal reserves and resources, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of coal reserves and resources are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves and resources consists of estimates based on engineering, economic, and geological data assembled by third-party qualified persons. Information used to determine recoverable reserves and resources include geological conditions, historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas, assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies, assumptions governing future prices, and future operating costs. Each of these may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves and resources. For these reasons, estimates of economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties, and classification of these reserves and resources based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to reserves and resources will likely vary from estimates and these variances may be material. Variances could affect our projected future revenues and expenditures, valuation of coal reserves and resources, and amortization and depletion of mine development costs and mineral rights.
Asset Retirement Obligations
. We initially recognize as a liability an asset retirement obligation, or ARO, associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset in the period in which it is incurred or a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The initially recognized asset retirement cost is amortized using the same method and useful life as the long-lived asset to which it relates. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. The liability is reduced as the reclamation work is performed and the related costs are applied.
Estimating the ARO requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing and existence of a liability, as well as what constitutes adequate restoration. Inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, and the timing of the related cash flows. On at least an annual basis, we review our ARO liabilities and make necessary adjustments for significant increases in disturbed acreage, mining permit changes, significant mine plan revisions, and changes in cost estimates or timing of performance. To the extent future revisions are made to the ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the related asset. 
If our assumptions differ from actual experience, or if changes in the regulatory environment occur, our actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. The inflation per year assumption used in the most recent estimate was approximately 3% based on a weighting of multiple indices.
Occupational Disease (Pneumoconiosis) Obligations
. We recognize as a liability to provide for occupational illness (pneumoconiosis) benefits to eligible employees, former employees and dependents as required by the Mine Act. The occupational illness benefit obligation represents the present value of the actuarially computed liabilities for such benefits over the employees’ applicable years of service.
Estimating the future occupational disease (pneumoconiosis) benefits requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing and existence of a liability utilizing third-party actuaries to assist in preparing what constitutes adequate liability amounts. Inherent in the calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs, mortality factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, and timing of settlement. These estimates are subject to uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including limited Ramaco-specific claim volume, developments regarding medicine and treatment, and future cost trends. As a result, volatility in future estimates may occur and actual costs 
88

Table of Contents
could differ significantly from the estimated amounts. The Company recognized a $0.5 million actuarial gain in the fourth quarter of 2024 due in part to a 0.6% increase in the discount rate assumption.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets. 
We review our held-and-used long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, which is generally at the mine level or at the mining complex level for mines that share infrastructure and/or developed access. 
Events and circumstances that may trigger a recoverability assessment include, but are not limited to, a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in the physical condition of the asset(s), and an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected. We generally do not view short-term declines in metallurgical coal prices as a triggering event for conducting impairment tests because of historic price volatility. In addition, a temporary idling of operations at a particular mine or complex may or may not be viewed as a triggering event depending on the remaining life of the mine, the length of time the mine is expected to be idle, and the amount of incremental costs expected to resume operations.
When events or changes in circumstances occur that trigger a recoverability test, the test is performed by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group, if any.
We make various assumptions, including assumptions regarding future cash flows in our assessments of long-lived assets for impairment. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the current and long-term business plans related to the long-lived assets.
Income Taxes. 
We are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for future consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns for each tax paying jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires management to make judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of various agreements and transactions. We initially recognize the effects of a tax position when it is more than 50% likely, based on the technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination. Our determination of whether or not a tax position has met the recognition threshold depends on the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date.
We provide for deferred income taxes for temporary differences arising from differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities existing at each balance sheet date using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance may be recorded to reflect the amount of future tax benefits that management believes are not likely to be realized. The assessment takes into account expectations of future taxable income or loss, available tax planning strategies and the reversal of temporary differences. The development of these expectations involves the use of estimates such as production levels, operating profitability, timing of development activities and the cost and timing of reclamation work. If actual outcomes differ from our expectations, we may record an additional valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. The Company had no valuation allowance at December 31, 2024.
Actual income taxes could vary from the estimates and judgments above due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income, or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year’s liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on our financial position.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
In addition to the risks inherent in operations, we are exposed to financial, market, political and economic risks. The following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to the risks related to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Commodity Price Risk.
 Our primary product is metallurgical coal, which is in itself a commodity. The Company’s domestic sales contracts have terms of about one year and the pricing is typically fixed. Export sales have spot or term contracts, and pricing is often derived from an index. As such, we are exposed to changes in the international price of metallurgical coal.

Our sales commitments as of February 28, 2025 are as follows:

Sales commitments of 0.5 million tons were obtained subsequent to December 31, 2024 and are included in the table above. 
Sales commitments in the metallurgical coal market are typically not long-term in nature and, therefore, we are subject to fluctuations in market pricing. The Company’s shift to more export sales in its mix of revenues that has occurred during recent years exposes the Company’s revenues to greater volatility due to index-based pricing. The Company does not currently manage this risk through the use of derivative instruments. We also have exposure to price risk for supplies that are used directly or indirectly in the normal course of production such as diesel fuel, explosives, and other items. The Company manages its risk for these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our suppliers.
Interest Rate Risk.

We are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates; however, based on the current levels of debt and leases, the Company does not attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The Company has senior unsecured notes with a face value of $34.5 million that mature on July 30, 2026, unless redeemed prior to maturity, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 9% per annum and paid quarterly. The Company also issued new senior unsecured notes during the fourth quarter of 2024 with a face value of $57.5 million that mature on November 30, 2029, unless redeemed prior to maturity, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 8.375% per annum and paid quarterly.
Some of the Company’s debts may be affected by changes in benchmark interest rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). Borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maturity date of May 3, 2029, bear interest at either a base rate plus 2.0% or the applicable SOFR plus 2.5%. The base rate equals the highest of the administrative agent’s prime rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5%, or 3.0%.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk.

International sales of coal are typically denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, we do not have direct exposure to currency valuation exchange rate fluctuations. However, because our coal is sold internationally, to the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currency of a customer or potential customer, we may find our coal at a price disadvantage as compared with other non-U.S. suppliers. This could lead to our receiving lower prices or being unable to compete for that specific customer’s business. Consequently, currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Ramaco Resources, Inc.
Opinion on the financial statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Ramaco Resources, Inc. (a Delaware Corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated March 17, 2025, expressed an adverse opinion.
Change in accounting principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has adopted new accounting guidance in 2024 related to the disclosure of segment information in accordance with ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280)
.
Basis for opinion 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
​
Critical audit matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Earnings Per Share Computation and Disclosures
As described further in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has two classes of common stock and the Company’s board of directors retains the ability, in its sole discretion, to exchange all outstanding shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock based on an established exchange ratio. In addition, the Company has several classes of stock-based compensation awards that are participating securities. Convertible securities are evaluated for potential inclusion in diluted earnings per share computations using the if-converted method. In addition, with multiple classes of common stock and participating securities, the Company also follows the two-class method of computing earnings per share. We identified the computation of and the disclosures related to earnings per share as a critical audit matter.
92

Table of Contents
The principal consideration for our determination that the earnings per share computation and disclosures is a critical audit matter was the extensive audit effort required to assess the Company’s earnings per share calculations for compliance with the applicable accounting standards. The extensive audit effort resulted from the unique nature of the Company’s Class B common stock, the conversion features associated with the Class B common stock, and the multiple participating securities that must be considered in the determination of earnings per share using the if converted and two-class methods for calculating earnings per share.  
Our audit procedures related to earnings per share computation and disclosures included the following, among others: 
●
We consulted with our national office resources regarding the accounting standards applicable to earnings per share to assist with the evaluation of the Company’s compliance with those standards.
●
We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used as inputs to the Company’s earnings per share calculation.
●
We recomputed basic and diluted earnings per share for each class of common stock.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Ramaco Resources, Inc.
Opinion on internal control over financial reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Ramaco Resources, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described in the following paragraphs on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by COSO.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment.
Management identified a material weakness related to the Company having insufficient accounting resources. The resource constraints contributed to an ineffective control environment whereby the Company did not consistently have professionals with the right experience and training to perform certain control activities to achieve control objectives described in the aforementioned internal control framework. The insufficient resources also resulted in incomplete or inadequate documentation related to accounting policies and procedures, inappropriate conclusions reached regarding non-routine accounting matters, and insufficient evidence of internal control activities.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. The material weakness identified above was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 17, 2025, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
​
Basis for opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
​
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Ramaco Resources, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
NOTE 1—DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Ramaco Resources, Inc. (the “Company,” “Ramaco,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Delaware corporation formed in October 2016. Our principal corporate and executive offices are located in Lexington, Kentucky with operational offices in Charleston, West Virginia and Sheridan, Wyoming. We are an operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost metallurgical coal in southern West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. We also control mineral deposits near Sheridan, Wyoming as part of the Company’s initiatives regarding the potential recovery of rare earth elements from coal and carbonaceous ore as well as the potential commercialization of coal-to-carbon-based products and materials. The Company is a party to certain collaborative arrangements with government researchers and other organizations related to the Wyoming initiatives, which involve providing in-kind contributions such as ores, samples, feedstock, and services.
NOTE 2—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
—The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis for all periods presented. All significant intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements have been adjusted to conform to current presentation.
Use of estimates
—The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates are related to the quantity and value of coal inventories, stock-based compensation, asset retirement obligations, occupational disease obligations, evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment, quantities and values of coal reserves, depletion and amortization, useful lives, and income taxes.
Revenue Recognition
—Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of coal through contracts with steel producers usually having durations of less than one year. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied. This occurs when control of the coal is transferred to our customers. For coal shipments to domestic customers via rail, control is generally transferred when the railcar is loaded. Control is transferred for export coal shipments to customers via ocean vessel when the vessel is loaded at the port.
Our coal sales generally include up to 90-day payment terms following the transfer of control of the goods to our customer. In the case of some of our foreign customers, our contracts also require that letters of credit are posted to secure payment of any outstanding receivable. We do not include extended payment terms in our contracts. Our contracts with customers typically provide for minimum specifications or qualities of the coal we deliver. Variances from these specifications or qualities are settled by means of price adjustments. Generally, these price adjustments are settled within 30 days of delivery and are insignificant. 
Certain of our contracts with customers include provisions in which the price is derived from an index. If control of the goods transfers to the customer in the period before the final price is determined, revenue is recorded based on the estimated consideration to be received. The Company estimates the amount to which it expects to receive by reference to forward curve data, if available, and generally does not constrain such estimates for accounting purposes due to the short period of time over which the uncertainty is resolved. However, certain estimates of provisional pricing for which no forward curve data was available were constrained at December 31, 2023 due to index volatility. No estimates were constrained at December 31, 2024.

Table of Contents
Freight Revenue and Expense
—Costs incurred to transport coal to the point of sale at the port facility are included in cost of sales and the gross amounts billed to customers to cover shipping to and handling of the coal at the port are included in revenue.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
—We classify all highly-liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. Restricted cash balances at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were both $
0.8
 million and consisted of funds held in escrow for potential future workers’ compensation claims. Restricted cash balances were included in other current assets on the balance sheet. The Company pools individual bank accounts with the same institution for the purpose of assessing if a bank overdraft exists based on the contractual terms of the arrangement.
Inventories
— Coal is reported as inventory at the point in time it is extracted from the mine. Coal inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out inventory valuation method. Coal inventory costs include labor, supplies, equipment costs, freight, operating overhead, depreciation and amortization. Coal inventory quantities are adjusted periodically based on aerial surveys of coal stockpiles. Lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments are made as market conditions warrant. Supply inventories are valued at average cost. Inventories consisted of the following:

Property, Plant and Equipment
—Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures which extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment are capitalized. Planned major maintenance costs which do not extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit or loss on disposition is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. 
Exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Coal exploration costs include those incurred to ascertain existence, location, extent or quality of ore or minerals before beginning the development stage of the mine.
Mining property and mineral rights costs represent the costs incurred to acquire the rights to access and mine certain coal property either through deeds, leases, or other conveyance agreements. These costs include the costs of acquiring, and accessing mineral reserves, resources and surface areas for mining activities.
Mine development begins when the facts and circumstances clearly establish the presence of a commercial mineralized deposit. Capitalized mine development costs represent the costs incurred to prepare mine sites and/or seams of coal for future mining. These costs include costs of acquiring, permitting, planning, research, and developing access to identified mineral reserves and other preparations for commercial production as necessary to develop and permit the properties for mining activities. When components of capitalized mine development costs are replaced with new components, the Company capitalizes the replacement as a separate component and charges off the net book value of the component that was replaced at the cease-use date.
If it is determined that an undeveloped mineral interest cannot be economically converted into proven and probable reserves, capitalized costs are assessed for impairment and future development costs are expensed as incurred. Operating expenditures, including certain professional fees and overhead costs, are not capitalized but are expensed as incurred.
Mineral rights and capitalized mine development costs are depleted and amortized on a units-of-production basis as mining of that mine’s assigned reserves takes place. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 
three
 to 
thirty years
.

Table of Contents
Advanced Coal Royalties
—In most cases, we acquire the right to mine coal reserves under leases which call for the payment of royalties on coal as it is mined and sold. In many cases, these mineral leases require the payment of advance or minimum coal royalties to lessors that are recoupable against future production royalties. These advance payments are deferred and charged to operations as the coal reserves are mined.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
—We review and evaluate held-and-used long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and mine development costs, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset or asset group’s carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value, if any. We may, under limited circumstances, idle mining operations in response to certain events or conditions. Because an idling is not a permanent closure, it is not considered an automatic indicator of impairment.
Asset Retirement Obligations
—Legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are initially recognized at their estimated fair value, with a corresponding charge to capitalized development costs, at the time they are incurred. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates related to reclaiming metallurgical coal land and support facilities in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. Spending estimates are adjusted for inflation and then discounted at the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value over time and the capitalized cost is amortized using the units-of-production method over estimated recoverable reserves upon commencement of mining. We review our asset retirement obligations on at least an annual basis for significant changes in the estimated timing and/or amount of cash flows.
Occupational Disease (Pneumoconiosis) Obligations
. We recognize as a liability to provide for occupational disease (pneumoconiosis) benefits to eligible employees, former employees and dependents as required by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969, as amended. The occupational disease benefit obligation represents the present value of the actuarially computed liabilities for such benefits over the employees’ applicable years of service.
Estimating our occupational disease (pneumoconiosis) benefits obligation requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing and existence of a liability utilizing third-party actuaries to assist in preparing what constitutes adequate liability amounts. Inherent in the calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs, mortality factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, and timing of settlement. Adjustments to estimated liabilities due to changes in actuarial assumptions are recorded immediately in earnings in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. 
Leases
—We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception, and lease classification is determined at the commencement date. Leases are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities except for leases with a term of 12 months or less. 
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of the fixed lease payments over the lease term. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components for all leases as permitted under the accounting guidance for leases. As most of our leases do not contain a readily determinable implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating and finance lease ROU assets also include lease prepayments made by the Company and are reduced by any lease incentives received by the Company prior to commencement. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. For operating leases, lease expense is recorded in the income statement based on a straight-line recognition of the total fixed payments over the lease term. For finance leases, accretion of the liability is recognized as interest expense and the ROU asset is amortized separately on a straight-line basis similar to the depreciation of equipment owned by the Company. 
103

Table of Contents
Leases of mineral reserves and the related land leases are exempted under U.S. GAAP from recognition on the consolidated balance sheets.
Fair Value Measurements
— Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value are categorized in the fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs utilized in the valuation. The levels of the hierarchy include: Level 1 - inputs are quoted prices in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 - inputs are other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable through market-corroborated inputs; and Level 3 - inputs are unobservable, or observable but cannot be market-corroborated, requiring us to make assumptions about pricing by market participants.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, and accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts at each reporting date. The Company’s Senior Notes that are due in 2026 had an estimated fair value of $
35.6
 million and $
35.5
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company’s Senior Notes that are due in 2029 had an estimated fair value of $
58.1
 million at December 31, 2024. The fair values of the Company’s Senior Notes were based on observable market prices and were considered Level 2 measurements at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 based on trading volumes. The difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the Company’s remaining debts is not material. Refer to Note 7 for additional information regarding debt.
Nonrecurring fair value measurements of the Company include asset retirement obligations and estimated values used to allocate the acquisition cost of long-lived assets to individual assets, neither of which are subject to the fair value disclosure requirements. 
The fair value of asset retirement obligations is determined as the present value of estimated cash flows related to reclamation obligations, which would likely be a Level 3 measurement due to the use of unobservable inputs such as estimates regarding the amount and timing of costs to be incurred, inflation rates, and the Company’s credit-adjusted discount rate.
The consideration for the Company’s previous acquisitions was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired, the primary asset of which was mineral rights. The fair values of mineral rights were determined based on Level 3 inputs, which are generally unobservable, requiring the Company to make assumptions about future coal prices, capital expenditures, future coal production, costs of production, and an appropriate rate at which to discount the future cash flows. 
Income Taxes
—Income tax expense (benefit) includes Federal and state income taxes. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. We account for deferred income taxes by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the reporting date of the balance sheet. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. In determining the appropriate valuation allowance, we consider the projected realization of tax benefits based on expected levels of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. The Company had 
no
 valuation allowances on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Uncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We had 
no
 significant uncertain tax positions requiring liability recognition as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. We file income tax returns in the U.S. and in various state and local jurisdictions which may be routinely examined by tax authorities. The statute of limitations for examination of the Company’s tax filings by taxing authorities is currently open for tax returns filed for the year 2021 and thereafter. 
The Company recognizes penalties and accrued interest related to income tax matters in 
Other income (expense), net
 and 
Interest expense net
, respectively, separately from the tax provision recorded in 
Income tax expense
 on the income statement.

Stock-Based Compensation
—Compensation cost for equity awards is based on the grant-date fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period. For awards with graded vesting, the Company recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
The fair values of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards having only a service condition were determined using the publicly-traded price of our common stock on the grant date. The fair value of performance stock units, which vest based on the achievement of relative total shareholder return goals, was determined on the date of grant based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of stock option awards was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend rate and service period.
Concentrations
—Our current operations are all related to metallurgical coal within the mining industry. A reduction in metallurgical coal prices or other disturbances in the metallurgical coal markets could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
During 2024, sales to 
two
 customers accounted for 
11
% and 
10
% of our revenues, or collectively 
22
% of total revenue. During 2023, sales to 
three
 customers accounted for 
15
%, 
13
%, and 
13
% of our revenues, or collectively 
41
% of total revenue. During 2022, sales to 
two
 customers accounted for 
21
% and 
17
% of our revenues, or collectively 
38
% of total revenue. The number of customers comprising the concentrations above is based on a threshold of 10% or more of total revenues. 
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. We monitor the credit ratings and concentration of risk with financial institutions on a continuing basis to safeguard our cash deposits. In addition, the Company is party to an arrangement that began in 2023 whereby our cash and cash equivalents are placed at various banks in amounts no greater than the $250,000 FDIC-insured limit to help safeguard against potential losses in the financial sector.  
We have a limited number of customers. Contracts with these customers provide for billings principally upon shipment and compliance with payment terms is monitored on an ongoing basis. Outstanding receivables beyond payment terms are promptly investigated and discussed with the specific customer. We estimate an allowance for credit losses by taking into consideration the age of past due accounts and an assessment of our customers’ ability to pay. An allowance for credit losses was not necessary as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Recent Accounting Standards Updates
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-07”). The amendments in ASU 2023-07 require incremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments and increase the frequency with which most segment disclosures are made. Incremental disclosures required by the ASU include significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within the segment’s measure of profit or loss, the title and position of the CODM and an explanation how the CODM uses the reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss to assess performance and allocate resources, and the amount and composition of other segment items necessary to reconcile segment revenue, significant expenses, and the reported measure of profit or loss. The ASU also expands interim disclosure requirements such that nearly all annual quantitative segment disclosures will be made on an interim basis. Lastly, ASU 2023-07 requires that entities with a single reportable segment provide all segment disclosures that are not evident from the primary financial statements, including significant segment expenses, consistent with the approach used by management to evaluate performance, which affects the

Company’s disclosures. ASU 2023-07 is effective starting with this annual report, and on a quarterly basis thereafter, and requires retrospective application. Refer to Note 15 for new disclosures by the Company.
​
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-09”). The amendments in ASU 2023-09 require reporting entities to disclose annual income taxes paid, net of refunds, disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes and to provide additional disaggregated information for individual jurisdictions that equal or exceed 5% of total income taxes paid, net of refunds. ASU 2023-09 also requires public business entities to disclose additional categories of information about federal, state, and foreign income taxes in their annual rate reconciliation table and provide more information about some categories if the quantitative threshold is met. The ASU will also require disclosure of amounts 
and
 percentages in the annual rate reconciliation table, rather than amounts 
or
 percentages, and will eliminate certain existing disclosure requirements related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. ASU 2023-09 is effective starting with Ramaco’s 2025 annual financial statements and may be applied prospectively to only the income tax disclosures provided for 2025 or retrospectively by providing revised disclosures for all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU; however, incremental disclosures will likely be provided on a prospective basis in the Company’s 2025 annual financial statements upon adoption.
​
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses 
(“ASU 2024-03”). The amendments in ASU 2024-03 require public business entities to disclose in the notes to the financial statements, among other things, specific information about certain costs and expenses including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, and depreciation, amortization, and depletion expenses for each caption on the income statement where such expenses are included. ASU 2024-03 is effective starting with the Company’s 2027 annual financial statements and on a quarterly basis thereafter. Early adoption is permitted, and the amendments may be applied prospectively to reporting periods after the effective date or retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the extent to which its disclosures will be affected by the ASU.

On July 10, 2022, the Company experienced a methane ignition at the Berwind No. 1 mine, which was one of the active mines at our Berwind mining complex. The other mines resumed production while the Berwind No. 1 mine was idled until a full investigation could be conducted. There were 
no
 personnel in the mine at the time of the incident and no injuries or fatalities occurred. The overall impact to pre-tax earnings in 2022 was immaterial except for idle mine costs of $
9.5
 million recognized during the year. Production from the Berwind No. 1 mine restarted in the first quarter of 2023. The Company received $

NOTE 4—ACQUISITIONS
Ramaco Coal
​
On April 29, 2022, the acquisition of Ramaco Coal, an entity owned by an investment fund managed by Yorktown Partners and certain members of the Company's management, was completed pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated February 23, 2022. The purchase price was approximately $
65
 million, consisting of an initial payment of $
10
 million paid at closing and a deferred purchase price of $
55
 million paid during the remainder of 2022 in $
5
 million ratable quarterly installments, and $
10
 million ratable quarterly installments paid in 2023 plus interest at a rate of 
9
%.
​
Ramaco Coal controls certain coal mineral interests of principally metallurgical coal properties which are owned in fee or leased under long-term leases that are, in turn, leased or subleased to the Company and various third parties. Such lessees pay a royalty based on the amount of metallurgical coal mined and the realized price per ton.
​
Ramaco Coal also controls a large thermal coal deposit and permit near Sheridan, Wyoming covering approximately 
16
 thousand acres, including a research and development facility and associated equipment and has a goal of converting coal to carbon products, such as graphene, graphite and carbon fiber.
​
Concurrent with this acquisition, the Company and Ramaco Coal each sold certain mineral rights located in West Virginia (the “Split Ridge Arrangement”). To compensate for the sale of these rights, we received an overriding royalty arrangement which included $
2
 million up front and $
125
 thousand quarterly minimum royalty payment beginning in January 2024 until December 2028. The fair value of this arrangement was $
3.7
 million, of which $
1.6
 million was treated as an allocation of the fair value of this disposed component of Ramaco Coal and, separately, a $
2.1
 million gain on the sale of the Company’s mineral rights included in 
Other income (expense), net
 on the 2022 Consolidated Statement of Operations.
​
The acquisition of Ramaco Coal was accounted for as a purchase of assets due to substantially all of the fair value being concentrated in a single asset, the rights to metallurgical coal deposits. The consideration paid in connection with the acquisition of Ramaco Coal, including $
1.6
 million in closing costs, relinquishment of $
1.6
 million of prepaid royalties and $
0.1
 million paid to a mineral owner as part of the acquisition, was approximately $
68.3
 million and was allocated based on fair values to mining property and mineral rights ($
65.1
 million), buildings ($
2.6
 million) and equipment ($
0.6
 million). The acquisition financing was repaid in full during 2023.

Maben Coal
​
On September 23, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 
100
% of the equity interests of Maben Coal, LLC (“Maben Coal”) pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement dated August 8, 2022, with Appleton Coal, LLC. The purchase price was approximately $
30.0
 million, consisting of an initial payment of $
9.0
 million and proceeds from a new two-year loan in the amount of $
21.0
 million. The Company also paid approximately $
1.7
 million of transaction costs and recognized liabilities of $
1.3
 million on the closing date, primarily related to $
1.2
 million of cash bond replacement obligations incurred by the Company as part of the transaction. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company paid off the $
1.2
 million cash bond replacement obligation to Appleton Coal, LLC, which was included in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows. The $
1.2
 million bond replacement payment was subsequently recovered in 2023, which reduced the cash investment related to this transaction to $
10.7
 million. 
​
We acquired a large coal deposit on approximately 
28
 thousand leased acres located in Wyoming County and Raleigh County, West Virginia. We assumed existing mining permits issued by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, which authorizes mining by both surface and highwall mining methods as well as by underground methods. The property also has issued permits covering an existing haul road, as well as an active refuse disposal area together with a preparation plant and unit train loadout, neither of which had been constructed as of the closing date. 
​
The acquisition of Maben Coal was accounted for as a purchase of assets due to substantially all of the fair value being concentrated in a single asset, the rights to leased metallurgical coal deposits. The total consideration of approximately $
33.0
 million was allocated to mining property and mineral rights ($
30.6
 million), capitalized mine development costs ($
1.0
 million), receivable for the right to recover cash bond replacement payments made by the Company as discussed above ($
1.2
 million, which was received in 2023), and recoupable royalties ($
0.2
 million). The acquisition financing was repaid in full during 2024.

2.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
​
108

Table of Contents
Other long-term liabilities
 were comprised primarily of worker’s compensation and occupational disease obligations discussed below.
​
Workers’ Compensation and Occupational Disease Obligations
​
We are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation claims and occupational disease obligations under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969, as amended. Starting in 2023, the Company also elected to self-insure employee medical expenses. We purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of these claims. Self-insured losses are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred as of the balance sheet date using claims data and actuarial assumptions. The occupational disease benefit obligation represents the present value of the actuarially computed liabilities for such benefits over the employees’ applicable years of service. 
​
As of December 31, 2024, the estimated aggregate liability for claims totaled $
8.3
 million, including $
2.4
 million of occupational disease obligations. Of the aggregate liability, $
5.2
 million was included in 
Other long-term liabilities
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, the Company recognized an expected recovery asset of $
1.5
 million in 
Other
 noncurrent assets related to the reimbursement of workers’ compensation amounts that are reimbursable under insurance purchased by the Company. As of December 31, 2023, the estimated aggregate liability totaled $
5.2
 million, including $
2.3
 million of occupational disease obligations. Of the aggregate liability, $
3.1
 million was included in 
Other long-term liabilities
 within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
​
The Company recognized an actuarial gain of $
0.5
 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 related to the annual measurement of our occupational disease benefit obligation, which was due, in part, to the increase in the discount rate assumption. The occupational disease benefit liability was calculated using a discount rate of 
5.9
% and 
5.3
% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Disclosures of net periodic benefit cost and estimated future cash payments related to occupational disease benefits have been omitted due to immateriality.

125.0
 million as well as an accordion feature of $

0.5
%, or 
3.0
%. 
The terms of the facility include covenants limiting the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, incur liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, and enter into transactions with affiliates. The terms of the facility also require the Company to maintain certain covenants, including fixed charge ratio and compensating balance requirements. A fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 
1.10
:1.00, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, must be maintained by the Company. In addition, the Company must maintain an average daily cash balance of $
5
 million, as determined on a monthly basis, in a dedicated account as well as an additional $
1.5
 million and $
1.0

NOTE 8—LEASES 
​
The Company has various finance leases for mining equipment, which generally include 
3
-
5
 year terms and expire through 2028. In addition, we have 
two
 operating leases for office space with initial terms of approximately 
five
 and 
six years
 that run through 2027 and 2030, respectively, including the office space in Charleston, WV that commenced in the first quarter of 2024 resulting in the recognition of an additional right-of-use asset and lease liability of 
approximately
 $
1
 million.
​
Amortization of right-of-use assets associated with finance leases was $
10.4
 million, $
8.5
 million, and $
4.8
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, as discussed in Note 3. Interest expense recognized for financing lease liabilities was $
0.9
 million, $
0.6
 million, and $
0.4
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Operating lease expense was $
0.4
 million in 2024, $
0.2
 million in 2023, and $
0.2
 million in 2022. Short-term lease costs were approximately $
350
 thousand in 2024 and were not material for prior periods.
​
Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are determined as the present value of the lease payments, discounted using either the implicit interest rate in the lease or, more commonly, our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on similar terms, payments and the economic environment where the leased asset is located. Below is a summary of our leases:

During 2024, the Company also entered into a 
five-year
 lease of equipment for the purpose of reducing environmental waste, mainly water, incurred during certain mining operations, which is not reflected in the disclosures above because the commencement date has not occurred for accounting purposes as of December 31, 2024. The lease commenced in February 2025 subsequent to the date of the financial statements.
Coal Leases and Associated Royalty Commitments
—Leases of mineral reserves and related land leases are exempt from the lease accounting requirements addressed above. Refer to Note 10 for information regarding coal leases and associated royalty commitments.
NOTE 9—EQUITY
On June 12, 2023, an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation was approved by shareholder vote to reclassify the Company’s existing common stock as shares of Class A common stock and create a separate Class B common stock. We are authorized to issue up to a total of 
225,000,000
 shares of Class A common stock and 
35,000,000
 shares of Class B common stock as well as 
50,000,000
 shares of 
preferred
 stock, each having a par value of $
0.01
 per share.
The initial distribution of Class B common stock occurred on June 21, 2023 via a stock dividend to existing holders of common stock as of May 12, 2023. On the date of initial distribution, each holder of common stock received 
0.2
 shares of Class B common stock for every one share of existing common stock held on the record date. Similar actions or modifications occurred for holders of outstanding stock-based awards.
The distribution of the Class B common stock provides existing holders of the Company’s common stock with an opportunity to participate directly in the financial performance of the Company’s CORE assets on a stand-alone basis, separate from the Company’s metallurgical coal operations. CORE assets were acquired initially as part of the Company’s acquisition of Ramaco Coal in the second quarter of 2022. The financial performance of CORE assets consists of the following non-cost-bearing revenue streams based on the Company’s current expectations:
●
Royalty fees derived from the royalties associated with the Ramaco Coal and Amonate reserves, which we believe approximates 
3
%
 of Company-produced coal sales revenue excluding coal sales revenue from Knox Creek,
●
Infrastructure fees based on 
$
5.00
 per ton of coal processed at our preparation plants and 
$
2.50
 per ton of loaded coal at the Company’s rail load-out facilities, and
●
Future income derived, if and when realized, from advanced carbon products and rare earth elements initiatives.

Table of Contents
​
The Company has paid dividends equal to 
20
% of the total fees above; however, any dividend amounts declared and paid are subject to the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. 
​
In addition, the Board of Directors retains the power to change or add expense allocation policies related to CORE, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine CORE’s per-ton usage fees at any time, in its sole discretion, without shareholder approval. Holders of shares of Class A common stock continue to be entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to any prior rights and preferences that may be applicable to outstanding preferred stock, if any.
​
CORE is not a separate legal entity, and holders of 
Class B
 common stock do not own a direct interest in the assets of CORE. Holders of Class B common stock are stockholders of Ramaco Resources, Inc. and are subject to all risks and liabilities of the Company as a whole. 
​
With respect to voting rights, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders and are entitled to 
one
 vote per share. The holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Class B common stock does not have any specific voting rights or governance rights with respect to CORE.
​
With respect to liquidation rights, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably the assets available for distribution to the stockholders after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of outstanding preferred stock, if any. That is, the rights to residual net assets upon liquidation are equal between holders of Class A and Class B common stock. Holders of Class B common stock do not have specific rights to CORE assets in the event of liquidation.
​
Shares of Class A common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights and are not subject to further calls or assessment by us. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to Class A common stock. The Board of Directors retains the ability, in its sole discretion, to exchange all outstanding shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock based on an exchange ratio determined by a 
20
-day trailing volume-weighted average price for each class of stock. If conversion were to have occurred on December 31, 2024, the Company would have issued approximately 
9
 million shares of Class A common stock and potential common shares of Class A in exchange for Class B common shares and unvested awards.
​
The initial distribution of the tracking stock was recorded as a stock dividend at fair value, which was estimated to be $
11.00
 per share based on the closing price of Class B shares on the first day of regular-way trading. The effect of the equity restructuring was a $
102.9
 million reduction in retained earnings and an increase of $
102.9
 million to Class B common stock and 
additional paid-in capital
 during the second quarter of 2023. The Company initially distributed 
8,201,956
 shares of Class B common shares as well as additional restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance stock units discussed below
.
​
Stock-Based Compensation Awards
Outstanding stock-based awards were reclassified to Class A common stock as part of the equity restructuring discussed above. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s outstanding stock-based awards, equitable adjustments were made in accordance with such terms, as discussed below, based on the same factor of 
0.2
 for every outstanding award. Since there were 
no
 changes in fair value, vesting conditions, or award classification, 
no
 incremental compensation expense resulted.
Our Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) is currently authorized by shareholders for the issuance of awards of up to approximately 
10.9
 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 
4.7
 million shares of common stock available for grant under the LTIP. 
In general, granted but unvested shares are forfeited upon termination of employment, unless an employee enters into another written arrangement. However, exceptions exist under certain circumstances upon a change in control event. Granted but unvested shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered. 
114

Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2024, we had four types of stock-based awards outstanding: stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance stock units. Stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards totaled $
17.5
 million in 2024, $
12.9
 million in 2023, and $
8.2
 million in 2022.
Stock Options—
We granted options

for the purchase of a total of 
937,424
 shares of our common stock for $
5.34
 per share to 
two
 executives on August 31, 2016. The options have a 
ten-year
 term from the grant date and are fully vested. During the third quarter of 2022, options to purchase 
20,000
 shares of common stock options with an intrinsic value of $
0.124
 million were exercised, leaving a balance of options to purchase 
917,424
 shares of common stock at December 31, 2022. During 2023, stock options of 
183,484
 shares of Class B awards were distributed to these individuals under the equitable adjustments discussed above. During the fourth quarter of 2023, options to purchase 
168,712
 shares of Class A common stock were exercised and stock options for 
33,742
 shares of Class B common stock were exercised having a combined intrinsic value of $
2.6
 million. The remaining options outstanding and unexercised at December 31, 2023 were 
748,712
 for Class A common stock and 
149,742
 for Class B common stock. During the third quarter of 2024, options to purchase 
100,000
 shares of Class A common stock were exercised and stock options for 
20,000
 shares of Class B common stock were exercised having a combined intrinsic value of $
0.6
 million. During the fourth quarter of 2024, stock options of 
12,034
 were distributed to these individuals for the non-cash dividend and stock dividend discussed later in this note. The remaining options outstanding and unexercised at December 31, 2024 were 
648,712
 for Class A common stock and 
141,776
 for Class B common stock, which were in-the-money at December 31, 2023, having a total intrinsic value of $
4.6
 million. 
No
 compensation expense was recognized for these awards in 2024, 2023, or 2022 as the awards became fully vested in previous years.

​
The total fair value of awards vested was $
28.9
 million during 2024, $
19.7

11.0
 million during 2022, excluding the fair value of shares to be issued in 2025 for PSUs with an evaluation period ending on December 31, 2024, which was $
2.8
 million.
Restricted Stock
—
We grant shares of restricted stock to certain senior executives, key employees and directors. These shares vest over approximately 
one
 to 
three and a half years
 from the date of grant. During the vesting period, the participants have voting rights and may receive dividends. Upon vesting, the restricted stock becomes unrestricted common shares. The fair value of the restricted stock on the date of the grant is amortized ratably over the service period. At December 31, 2024, there was $
2.6
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
1.9

years. The fair value of restricted stock awards that vested during 2024 was $
20.7
 million for Class A awards and $
3.4
 million for Class B awards. The fair value of the outstanding restricted stock awards was $
3.2
 million for Class A awards and $
0.3
 million for Class B awards based on the year-end 2024 closing stock prices.
Restricted Stock Units—
We grant shares of restricted stock units to certain senior executives and key employees. These share units vest ratably over approximately 
three years
 from the date of grant. During the vesting period, the participants have no voting rights and no dividend rights; however, participants are entitled to receive dividend equivalents, which shall be subject to the same conditions applicable to the units and payable at the time the units vest. Upon vesting and within 
30 days
 thereafter, the recipient will receive 
one
 share of common stock for each stock unit.
The grant date fair values of restricted stock units are recognized ratably over the service period. At December 31, 2024, there was $
5.9
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units to be recognized over the weighted average period of 
1.7
 years. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards that vested during 2024 was $
4.2
 million for Class A awards and $
0.6
 million for Class B awards. The fair value of the outstanding restricted stock unit awards was $
6.7
 million for Class A awards and $
0.8
 million for Class B awards based on the year-end 2024 closing stock prices.
Performance Stock Units—
We grant shares of performance stock units to certain senior executives and key employees. These share units cliff-vest approximately 
three years
 from the date of grant based on the achievement of targeted performance levels related to pre-established relative total shareholder return goals. These performance stock units have the potential to be earned from 
0
% to 
200
% of target depending on actual results. During the vesting period, the participants have no voting rights and no dividend rights; however, participants are entitled to receive dividend equivalents, which shall be subject to the same conditions applicable to the units and payable at the time the units vest. Upon vesting and within 
30 days
 thereafter, the recipient will receive 
one
 share of common stock for each stock unit. 
The Company’s performance stock units were valued relative to the stock price performance of a peer group of companies, which was based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of the performance stock units on the date of the grant is recognized ratably over the service period. At December 31, 2024, there was $
9.5
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance stock units to be recognized over the weighted average period of 
1.7
 years. The combined intrinsic value of the outstanding performance stock units for both classes, at target, was $
12.5
 million at December 31, 2024. The intrinsic value of these awards if the performance period had ended on December 31, 2024 is estimated at approximately $
18.3
 million, including the $
2.8
 million of shares to be issued in 2025 for PSUs with an evaluation period that concluded on December 31, 2024 discussed earlier.
Performance stock units originally granted in 2022 were modified during the first quarter of 2023. Modifications to these awards were made up primarily of changes in the composition of the peer group as well as changes in the way relative total shareholder return is evaluated against the updated peer group. The modification resulted in incremental fair value of $
1.2
 million, which was recognized as expense over 2023 and 2024.
Performance stock units are accounted for as awards with a market condition since vesting depends on total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies.
116

Table of Contents
Modification—
 The resignation of one of the Company’s executive officers and the separation agreement between the employee and the Company that occurred during the first quarter of 2024 resulted in a net charge to stock compensation expense of $
1.2
 million during the period. Incremental value of $
1.8
 million resulted from the continued equity vesting provision included in the separation agreement applicable to the employee’s restricted stock awards, which was recognized as expense. This amount was offset partially by the $
0.6
 million reversal of previously recognized compensation expense related to the pre-modified restricted stock award ($
0.3
 million) as well as the forfeiture of restricted stock units and performance stock units (collectively $
0.3
 million).
Taxes Related to Stock Awards—
The Company routinely allows employees to surrender common stock to pay estimated taxes upon the vesting or exercise of stock-based compensation awards. The value of common stock tendered by employees is determined based on the price of the Company’s common stock at the time of relinquishment. During 2024, employees surrendered approximately 
0.9
 million total shares for $
10.6
 million. During 2023, employees surrendered approximately 
0.7
 million total shares for $
7.3
 million. During 2022, employees surrendered approximately 
0.2
 million total shares for $
3.2
 million. There were no other repurchases of common shares.
​
​
​
​
Dividends

​
The Company declared a mix of cash and non-cash dividends to shareholders during 2024. The Company declared 
$
19.1
 million of total cash dividends during 2024, which includes 
$
12.1
 million to Class A shareholders, and 
$
6.2
 million to Class B shareholders and 
$
0.8
 million of forfeitable dividends subject to the vesting conditions of outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units. 
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company declared and issued 
$
6.4
 million of non-cash dividends to Class A shareholders, totaling 
$
6.0
 million of Class B common shares and 
$
0.4
 million of Class B forfeitable dividend equivalent units. The Company also declared and issued a 
$
2.2
 million non-cash dividend for its Class B shareholders, which included 
$
2.1
 million of Class B common shares and 
$
0.1
 million of Class B forfeitable dividend equivalent units. The number of Class B common shares and units was determined based on the closing price of Class B stock on the December 2, 2024 record date. The effect of both of these dividends was a reduction to retained earnings and an increase in Class B common stock and additional paid-in capital.
Lastly, during December 2024, the Company declared another $
6.3
 million of non-cash dividends to Class A shareholders, totaling $
6.0
 million of Class B common shares and $

 million of Class B forfeitable dividend equivalent units, which are to be issued on March 14, 2025 to shareholders of record on February 28, 2025, based on the closing price of Class B common stock on the record date. The effect of this dividend was a reduction to retained earnings and an increase to accrued liabilities since, at the reporting date, the dividend represented a fixed dollar amount obligation to be settled with a variable number of equity shares. Refer to Note 16 for additional information related to dividends that occurred subsequent to the date of the financial statements.

NOTE 10—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Environmental Liabilities
—
Environmental liabilities are recognized when the expenditures are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Measurement of liabilities is based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology and undiscounted site-specific costs. Generally, such recognition would coincide with a commitment to a formal plan of action. 
No
 amounts have been recognized for environmental liabilities.
Surety Bond
—
In accordance with state laws, we are required to post reclamation bonds to assure that reclamation work is completed. We also have a small amount of surety bonds that secure performance obligations. Bonds outstanding at December 31, 2024 totaled approximately $
32.3
 million. 
Coal Leases and Associated Royalty Commitments
—We lease coal reserves under agreements that require royalties to be paid as the coal is mined and sold. Many of these agreements require minimum annual royalties to be paid regardless of the amount of coal mined and sold. Total royalty expenses were $
27.9
 million, $
35.0
 million, and $
34.2
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. These agreements generally have terms running through exhaustion of all the mineable and merchantable coal covered by the respective lease. Royalties or throughput payments are based on a percentage of the gross selling price received for the coal we mine. Minimum royalty obligations under coal leases total $
29.1
 million and are broken down as follows: $
3.4
 million for 2025, $
3.4
 million for 2026, $
3.3
 million for 2027, $
3.3
 million for 2028, $
3.3
 million for 2029, and $
12.4
 million thereafter.
Contingent Transportation Purchase Commitments
—We secure the ability to transport coal through rail contracts and export terminals that are sometimes funded through take-or-pay arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s remaining commitments under take-or-pay arrangements totaled $
16.1
 million, which relates to a 
five-year
 contract that was entered into during 2023 having an original total commitment of $
22.5
 million. The remaining commitment for this contract was $
20.0
 million as of December 31, 2023. The 
five-year
 contract, which commenced on April 1, 2023 and runs through March 31, 2028, includes an annual minimum commitment of approximately $
5
 million for the remaining term. The level of these commitments will be reduced at a per-ton rate as such rail and export terminal services are utilized against the required minimum tonnage amounts over the contract term stipulated in such rail and export terminal contracts.
Litigation
— From time to time, we are subject to various litigation and other claims in the normal course of business. Losses related to such contingencies are accrued when/if loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. 
No
 losses have been accrued in the consolidated financial statements with respect to such matters. Losses from certain injury-related matters are reasonably possible of occurring; however, an estimate of the possible range of loss cannot be made at this time as no litigation has progressed sufficiently through discovery and development of 
118

Table of Contents
important facts and legal issues at this time. While it is possible that liability will be assessed against us in the preparation plant purchase matter discussed below, we deem that possibility to be remote.
Preparation Plant Purchase
In February 2024, we purchased a Preparation Plant (the “Plant”) from EMCOAL, Inc. for $
3
 million.  After this purchase, the Plant was disassembled and transported to the Maben Complex for reassembly.  On November 15, 2024, Justice Coal of Alabama, LLC (the “Plaintiff”) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, Beckley Division, against Ramaco Resources, Inc., Ramaco Development, LLC, and Maben Coal LLC.   
Plaintiff claims their sale of the Plant to EMCOAL, Inc. was not completed and thus EMCOAL, Inc. did not have the right to sell the Plant to us.  As a result of Ramaco purchasing the Plant from EMCOAL, Inc., Plaintiff claims in the complaint we are liable for conversion, unjust enrichment, and negligence.  Plaintiff has sought damages for these alleged claims. 
We filed a motion to dismiss on February 4, 2025 and that motion is currently pending before the Court. We believe we have meritorious defenses to all claims in this matter.
Storage Silo Partial Failure
On November 5, 2018, 
one
 of our 
three
 raw coal storage silos that fed our Elk Creek plant experienced a partial structural failure. A temporary conveying system completed in late-November 2018 restored approximately 
80
% of our plant capacity. We completed a permanent belt workaround and restored the preparation plant to its full processing capacity in mid-2019. Our insurance carrier, Federal Insurance Company, disputed our claim for coverage based on certain exclusions to the applicable policy and, therefore, on August 21, 2019, we filed suit against Federal Insurance Company and Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. in Logan County Circuit Court in West Virginia seeking a declaratory judgment that the partial silo collapse was an insurable event and to require coverage under our policy. Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, and upon removal, we substituted ACE American Insurance Company as a defendant in place of Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. The trial in the matter commenced on June 29, 2021, in Charleston, West Virginia. 
On July 15, 2021, the jury returned a verdict in our favor for $
7.7
 million in contract damages and on July 16, 2021, made an additional award of $
25.0
 million for damages for wrongful denial of the claim under 
Hayseeds, Inc.

v. State Farm Fire & Cas.
, 177 W. Va. 323, 352 S.E. 2d 73 (W. Va. 1986), including inconvenience and aggravation. On August 12, 2021, the defendants filed a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative to alter or amend the judgment or for a new trial. On March 4, 2022, the court entered its memorandum opinion and order on the motion reducing the jury award to a total of $
1.8
 million, including pre-judgment interest, and also vacated and set aside, in its entirety, the jury award of 
Hayseeds
 damages. The same day, the court entered the judgment in accordance with the memorandum opinion and order. 
On April 1, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On July 20, 2023, the court rendered a decision reinstating the jury’s $
7.7
 million contract damages verdict. The court further determined that we are entitled to attorney’s fees in an amount to be determined on remand. Finally, the court held that we are entitled to 
Hayseeds
 damages for wrongful denial of the claim but remanded for a new trial on the amount of such damages after affirming that the original $
25
 million award was excessive. On August 3, 2023, the Defendants-Appellees filed a Petition of Rehearing and Rehearing 
En Banc
 with the Fourth Circuit. The petition was denied by order dated August 15, 2023. On August 29, 2023, the court clarified that the amount of attorney’s fees to be determined on remand included appellate fees. On September 8, 2023, the court entered its amended judgment, which awarded post-judgment interest on the previously awarded and reinstated verdict related to contract (compensatory) damages and the Fourth Circuit thereafter issued its mandate on October 2, 2023. On August 19, 2024, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order that the Hayseeds damages to be considered in the new trial would include annoyance and inconvenience up to October 2, 2023 with new discovery permitted for the time period of July 15, 2021 through October 2, 2023. The Court also ordered Hayseeds damages to be considered for net economic loss caused by the defendant’s 
119

Table of Contents
delay in settlement be allowed for the time period of July 15, 2021 through October 2, 2023 with new discovery to be permitted for that time period.  
The defendants fully paid the portion of the judgment related to contract (compensatory) damages in the court’s order and that portion of the matter is considered closed. The Company recognized a $
7.8
 million gain during 2023, which was recorded in 
Other income (expense), net
 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of this amount, $
2.0
 million was included in 
Insurance proceeds related to property, plant, and equipment
 as part of investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the remaining amount was included in operating activities. On April 24, 2024, the Court stated Ramaco is entitled to reasonable attorney fees for both the appeal and the first trial, adding there will be a full 
Hayseeds
 trial under the timelines set forth above. Regarding the court’s determination and award of attorney’s fees, the Company accrued a total loss recovery asset of approximately $
3.9
 million in 
Prepaid expenses and other
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a corresponding reduction to 
Selling, general, and administrative
 expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2024. The Company considers that it is probable to recover at least this amount of previously recognized attorneys’ fees expenses based on the developments above. 
 The matter is now pending before the District Court for a new trial for 
Hayseeds
 damages, as well as the court’s determination and award of attorney’s fees.
NOTE 11—REVENUES
Our revenue is derived from contracts for the sale of coal and is recognized when the performance obligations under the contracts are satisfied, which is at the point in time control is transferred to our customer. Generally, domestic sales contracts have terms of about 
one year
 and the pricing is typically fixed. Export sales have spot or term contracts, and pricing can be either a fixed price or a price derived against index-based pricing mechanisms. North American revenue is made up of sales within the United States as well as sales into Canada. Sales completed with delivery to an export terminal are reported as export revenue. Disaggregated information about our revenue is presented below:

Annual revenues for 2024 include a $
1.3
 million net increase to revenue related to adjustments for performance obligations satisfied in a previous reporting period. These adjustments were due to true-ups of previous estimates for provisional pricing and demurrage as well as price adjustments for minimum specifications or qualities of delivered coal. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding performance obligations of approximately 
1.6
 million tons for contracts with fixed sales prices averaging $
152
 per ton as well as 
1.4
 million of additional tons for contracts with index-based pricing mechanisms
. 
The Company expects to satisfy approximately 
98
% of the committed tons in 
2025
 and the remainder in 2026. Variable amounts, including index-based prices, have not been estimated for the purpose of disclosing remaining performance obligations as permitted under the revenue recognition guidance when variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.
Sales into individual foreign countries equaling or exceeding 
10
% of our total revenues for 2024 included India and Germany, which represented 
11
% and 
10
% of 2024 revenues, respectively. Sales into Germany, Canada, and Brazil were 
14
%,

3
% of total revenue in 2024. The Company used the final export destination of the goods as the basis for these disclosures.

There was a significant decrease in 2024 compared to 2023 in the foreign-derived intangible income deduction related to our worldwide sales, which was primarily due to the decrease in taxable income and other limitations. 
During 2023, there was a significant increase in the foreign-derived intangible income deduction related to our worldwide sales compared to 2022. The amount of excess tax benefits for stock-based compensation and subsequently the impact of IRC Section 162(m) for covered employees also increased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to stock exercises.

 million during 2023, which drove the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets during 2023.
NOTE 14—EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
Earnings per share (“EPS”) is not presented retrospectively for periods prior to the issuance of the tracking stock as the tracking stock was not a part of the Company’s capital structure during those periods and the issuance of the tracking stock changes the common shareholders’ relative residual interest in the Company. Therefore, EPS is presented for the Company’s single class of common stock up to the time the tracking stock was issued. EPS is presented prospectively under the two-class method starting on the date of initial distribution of the tracking stock. Refer to Note 9 for information related to the Company’s tracking stock.
​
The computation of basic and diluted EPS is shown on the following page:

Unvested restricted stock awards have the nonforfeitable right to receive cash dividends on the same basis as common shares; therefore, unvested restricted stock is considered a participating security for the purpose of calculating EPS. Prior to the issuance of Class B common stock, the Company presented its EPS for its common stock and unvested restricted stock on a combined basis since both instruments participated in net earnings on the same basis and the resulting EPS is typically the same. Starting under the two-class method, the Company reports separately the net earnings allocated away from holders of Class A and Class B common stock to holders of unvested restricted stock awards. 
​
Unvested restricted stock units and performance stock units include forfeitable dividend rights that are subject to the vesting conditions of the underlying awards; therefore, these awards are not considered participating securities and should not be allocated undistributed earnings for the purpose of calculating EPS. However, dividends or dividend equivalents declared and charged to retained earnings for these awards reduce the amount of net earnings available for distribution to common stockholders and should be reflected as such under the two-class method.
​
The Company declared a non-cash dividend to Class A shareholders during the fourth quarter, which resulted in the issuance of 
0.6
 million shares of Class B common shares. Since the dividend involved different classes of common stock, the distribution of the shares was accounted for prospectively for EPS purposes and the $
6
 million non-cash dividend was attributed to Class A net earnings under the two-class method. A second non-cash dividend was declared to Class A shareholders in December 2024 and was accounted for similarly for EPS purposes except that the numbers of Class B shares had not been issued and were not determinable at December 31, 2024. The Company estimated the number of Class B common shares and unvested awards for Class B diluted EPS purposes.
​
The Company also declared a non-cash dividend to Class B shareholders during the fourth quarter, which resulted in the issuance of 
0.2
 million shares of Class B common shares. Since the Class B shareholders’ proportional interest in the Company’s overall net assets did not remain the same, the distribution of the shares was accounted for prospectively for EPS purposes and the $
2
 million non-cash dividend was attributed to Class B net earnings under the two-class method. 
​
For accounting purposes, Class B’s participation rights in net earnings are, in substance, discretionary based on the power of the Company’s Board of Directors to add or modify expense allocation policies, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine CORE’s per-ton usage fees at any time, in its sole discretion, without shareholder approval. Therefore, no amount of the Company’s net earnings shall be allocated to Class B for the purpose of calculating EPS other than actual cash dividends declared during the period for the tracking stock. However, during 2024, dividends declared by the Company were in excess of consolidated net income, which resulted in an undistributed net loss for reporting purposes. The resulting undistributed net loss was allocated proportionately between outstanding Class A and Class B common stock based on the rights to residual net assets upon liquidation being equal between holders of Class A and Class B common stock. Refer to Note 9 for information regarding dividends declared on Class B common stock.
​
Diluted EPS was calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units. For performance stock units, the awards were first evaluated under the contingently issuable shares guidance, which requires a determination as to whether shares would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. For shares determined to be issuable under performance stock unit awards, the treasury stock method was then applied to determine the dilutive impact of the awards, if any. Unvested restricted stock awards are considered potential common shares as well as participating securities, as discussed previously, and were included in diluted EPS using the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or the two-class method. Since these awards share in cash dividends on a 
1
:1 basis with common shares, applying the treasury stock method would be antidilutive compared to the basic EPS calculation that allocates earnings to participating securities under the two-class method discussed previously. 
​
As discussed in Note 9, the Board of Directors retains the ability, in its sole discretion, to exchange all outstanding shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock based on an exchange ratio determined by a 20-day trailing volume-weighted average price for each class of stock. The conversion right was evaluated for diluted EPS purposes under the if-converted method, which determines the potential dilutive effect, if any, on Class A shareholders assuming that conversion occurs. The hypothetical conversion assumed to have occurred would have resulted in the issuance of approximately 
8
 million shares and potential common shares and 
7.4
 million shares and 
125

Table of Contents
potential common shares of Class A common stock for 2024 and 2023, respectively, based on year-to-date outstanding averages for those years, and would have effectively redistributed Class B’s net earnings to Class A.
​
For the year ended December 31, 2024, diluted EPS for Class A common stock excluded 
313
 thousand RSUs, 
316
 thousand PSUs at target, and the hypothetical conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common stock, as discussed above, because the effect would have been antidilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2024, diluted EPS for Class B common stock excluded 
four
 thousand RSU equivalents and 
four
 thousand PSU equivalents because the effective would have been antidilutive.
​
Diluted EPS for the period from January 1, 2023 through June 20, 2023, the period for which a single class of common stock existed, excluded all outstanding restricted stock units, or 
684
 thousand units in total, because the effect would have been antidilutive. In addition, diluted EPS for the same period excluded outstanding performance stock units originally granted in 2022, or 
249
 thousand units at target, based on the guidance for contingently issuable shares. For the period from June 21, 2023 through December 31, 2023, the hypothetical conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common stock was immaterial, and 
no
 other potential common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for either class of common stock.
​
Diluted EPS for 2022 excluded 
249
 thousand target performance stock units based on the guidance for contingently issuable shares.
NOTE 15—SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company generates revenue primarily through the production of metallurgical coal for sale to the steel industry. Ramaco also generates revenue through the sale of coal purchased from third parties. 
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), the chief executive officer, regularly reviews financial information at the consolidated level for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing operating results and financial performance. Therefore, the Company has one operating and reportable segment.
The CODM uses consolidated net income as the segment profitability measure to evaluate the performance of its segment and make resource allocation decisions. Consolidated net income is used by the CODM to assess operating performance of its Appalachian operations as well as to make decisions regarding capital investments, labor allocation, compensation, and resource development. 
The CODM does not regularly review segment asset information at a different asset level or category than those disclosed within the consolidated balance sheet for the purpose of assessing performance and making resource allocation decisions. Significant expenses regularly reviewed by the CODM include cost of sales as reported on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Furthermore, significant expenses include more disaggregated cost of sales information, including cash cost of sales (on an FOB mine basis), transportation costs, and alternative mineral development costs, as shown in the following table:

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
On June 5, 2024, the Company notified Cherry Bekaert, LLP (“Cherry Bekaert”) of its dismissal, effective June 5, 2024, as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. Cherry Bekaert served as the auditors of 
127

Table of Contents
the Company’s financial statements for the period from April 19, 2022, through June 5, 2024 (such dates take into account the acquisition of MCM CPAs & Advisors LLP by Cherry Bekaert effective October 31, 2023).
The reports of Cherry Bekaert on the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle. The decision to change the independent registered public accounting firm was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Audit Committee”).
During the period from April 19, 2022 through June 5, 2024, the period during which Cherry Bekaert was engaged as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, there were no disagreements between the Company and Cherry Bekaert on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Cherry Bekaert, would have caused Cherry Bekaert to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its audit reports on the Company’s financial statements. During the period from April 19, 2022 through June 5, 2024, the period during which Cherry Bekaert was engaged as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, there were no “reportable events” (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K), except that, as previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, there was a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, in the Company’s financial reporting related to a pervasive lack of sufficient documentation of accounting policies, procedures and controls which does not allow management to effectively assess its relevant risks and key controls to properly test for design and operating effectiveness. This reportable event was discussed among the Audit Committee and Cherry Bekaert. Cherry Bekaert has been authorized by the Company to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor independent registered public accounting firm concerning this reportable event.
The Company provided Cherry Bekaert with a copy of the above statements and requested that Cherry Bekaert furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements and, if it does not agree, the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of the letter from Cherry Bekaert addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission dated as of June 6, 2024 is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
On June 6, 2024, the Company appointed Grant Thornton LLP (“Grant Thornton”) as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2024.
During the period from January 1, 2022, through June 6, 2024, neither the Company nor anyone on behalf of the Company consulted with Grant Thornton regarding (a) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company’s financial statements as to which the Company received a written report or oral advice that was an important factor in reaching a decision on any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (b) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) 
and (v), respectively, of Regulation S-K.    
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
As of December 31, 2024, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures in pursuant to applicable Exchange Act rules. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024 were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting disclosed below. The Company’s remediation plan for the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is also discussed below.
​
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management used the criteria described in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework

(2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
128

Table of Contents
Treadway Commission (“COSO”) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, management identified a material weakness related to an insufficiency of appropriately qualified and trained professionals to perform certain control activities necessary to achieve our control objectives. The material weakness also resulted in incomplete or inadequate documentation related to accounting policies and procedures, inappropriate conclusions reached regarding non-routine accounting matters, and insufficient evidence of internal control activities. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2024. 
​
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein and expressed an adverse opinion.
​
Remediation Plan.

We are continuing to develop a plan of remediation to address this material weakness, which will include assessing, redesigning, and implementing modifications of our internal controls, and hiring of additional qualified accounting personnel, or supplementing internal resources with qualified external advisors as needed. We will not be able to fully remediate this material weakness until these steps have been completed and subsequent validation and testing of these internal controls have demonstrated their operating effectiveness over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles.   
​
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
During 2024 we took steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. In June 2024, we engaged the services of a national professional services firm to assist us in evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. On July 1, 2024 we created and filled the position of Director of Internal Audit, and in August 2024 we engaged a top five accounting firm to assist us in reviewing technical non-routine accounting matters. There were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our 
fourth
 quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
