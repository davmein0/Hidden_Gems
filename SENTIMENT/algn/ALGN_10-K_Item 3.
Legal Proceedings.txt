Market Information
Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ALGN.” As of February 20, 2025, there were approximately 52 holders of record of our common stock. Because the majority of our shares of outstanding common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
