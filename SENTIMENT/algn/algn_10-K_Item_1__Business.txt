Clear Aligner Segment
Malocclusion and Traditional Orthodontic Treatment
5
Malocclusion is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions in the world, affecting approximately 60% to 75% of the global population. We estimate that there are approximately 600 million people globally with malocclusion who could benefit from straightening their teeth. However, most people afflicted by malocclusion do not seek orthodontic treatment for various reasons, including negative perceptions of traditional metal wires and brackets, affordability of treatment, and accessibility to doctors. Annually, only approximately 22 million people globally elect treatment by orthodontists. Today, most orthodontic patients continue to have their malocclusions treated with the use of traditional corrective methods such as metal arch wires and brackets, referred to as braces, augmented with elastics, metal expanders, headgear or functional appliances, and other ancillary devices as needed. Upon completion of a patient’s treatment, their dental professional may recommend the patient use a retainer appliance to preserve the benefits of their treatment. Of the 22 million cases started each year, we estimate that almost all can be treated using our Invisalign System, yet our share of the 22 million case starts through orthodontists is approximately 10% globally. Our business strategy remains focused on increasing our share of the existing market of orthodontic case starts compared to brackets and wires, especially among teens, and expand the market for digital orthodontics, especially among adults. By training more doctors, including GPs as well as orthodontists, increasing utilization of existing doctors using our products, educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using the Invisalign System and connecting consumers with an Invisalign-trained doctor of their choice, we are helping drive adoption of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry globally.
The Invisalign System
The Invisalign System is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a proprietary computer-simulated virtual treatment plan and a series of doctor-prescribed, custom manufactured, clear polymer removable aligners. We received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to market the Invisalign System in 1998. The Invisalign System offers a range of treatment options, specialized services and access to proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases:
Diagnosis and transmission of treatment data
. As part of the Align™ Digital Workflow, we have developed solutions to enable doctors to diagnosis and drive patient conversion from considering treatment to starting treatment – providing tools to support diagnosis of patients’ oral health and support to identify an appropriate treatment pathway, facilitating the doctor-patient conversation, education and clinical needs and expectations. An Invisalign trained dental professional prepares an online prescription form on our Invisalign Doctor Site and securely submits the patient’s records, which include a digital intraoral scan or a polyvinyl-siloxane (“PVS”) impression of the relevant dental arches, photographs of the patient and, at the dental professional’s election, x-rays of the patient’s dentition. Intraoral digital scans may be submitted through Align’s iTero scanner or certain third-party scanners capable of accurately interfacing with our systems and processes. Globally, approximately 94% of prescription orders for our Invisalign System are now submitted via digital scan, increasing the accuracy of treatment plans, reducing the time from when a doctor submits a prescription to the time a patient receives the clear aligners, and helping to decrease the carbon footprint resulting from elimination of the initial or upfront shipment of a patient’s PVS impressions to the doctors and shipping those PVS impressions back to us. 
Computer-simulated treatment plan
. Our ClinCheck
®
 Pro cloud-based treatment planning software is the cornerstone of the Align
TM
 Digital Platform. ClinCheck Pro leverages proprietary algorithms based on the insights from data from over

19 million patients treated worldwide. Using the digital scans or PVS impressions, any specific doctor preferences and digital data provided, we generate a proposed custom, three-dimensional ClinCheck
®
 treatment plan using proprietary software developed through significant, ongoing research and development investments spanning over two decades. A patient’s ClinCheck treatment plan simulates desired tooth movement in stages and details the timing and placement of any features or attachments to be used during treatment. Attachments are tooth-colored shapes that can be affixed to a patient’s teeth to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to affect the desired movement(s).
Treatment plan review and approval by an Invisalign-trained doctor.
 The patient’s proposed ClinCheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via our Invisalign Doctor Site, enabling the dental professional to evaluate projected tooth movement as it progresses from initial to final position and compare treatment plan options to best meet the dental professional’s treatment objectives. By reviewing, modifying as needed and approving an acceptable treatment plan, the dental professional retains control of the patient’s treatment.
Manufacture of custom clear aligners. 
Following the dental professional’s approval of a ClinCheck treatment plan, we use the data underlying the simulation as input for stereolithography technology (a form of 3D printing technology) to construct a series of molds. Each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each stage of the simulated course of treatment. From these molds, clear aligners are fabricated by pressure-forming polymeric sheets over each mold. Clear aligners are thin, clear polymer, removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series designed to correspond to each stage of a patient’s ClinCheck treatment plan.
6
Shipment to the dental professional and patient clear aligner wear.
 Once manufactured, each clear aligner for a patient’s doctor-approved treatment plan is typically shipped directly to the dental professional. The majority of doctors then distribute each clear aligner to their patients. Each set of clear aligners (one clear aligner for the lower and a second for the upper jaw) are generally worn for one week or for a short period of time corresponding to the stages of the patient’s approved ClinCheck treatment plan and their doctor’s discretion. The patient replaces their current set of clear aligners with the next pair in the series as and when prescribed, advancing tooth movement through each stage. At various points in each patient’s treatment, their doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements, per their doctor’s original prescription and the approved ClinCheck treatment plan. Additionally, for patients treated using many of our Invisalign System products, doctors have the option to order additional clear aligners for doctor-approved treatment plan refinements.
Clear Aligner Products
We offer our Invisalign System in a variety of treatment packages designed to correspond with the case-by-case treatment needs of our doctors and their patients and also designed on nonclinical needs. The table below provides a general description of the categories of products in our Invisalign System offered in various regions as they typically correspond to the severity of malocclusion and length of anticipated treatment.

The number and timing of additional clear aligner orders are subject to certain requirements noted in our terms and conditions. 
Comprehensive Products - Invisalign Treatment Options
Invisalign Comprehensive Packages
. The Invisalign Comprehensive Package is used to treat adults and teens over a wide spectrum of mild to severe malocclusion and contains a broad variety of features to address the desired treatment goals. It also addresses the frequently complex orthodontic needs of teenage or younger patients with advanced features such as mandibular advancement, compliance indicators and compensation for tooth eruption. These packages include Invisalign Comprehensive, Invisalign First
TM
 Phase 1 and Invisalign First
TM
 Comprehensive Phase 2. 
Invisalign First Phase 1 and Invisalign First Comprehensive Phase 2 Packages
. Invisalign First Phase 1 Package is designed specifically for younger patients generally between the ages of six and ten, who frequently have a mixture of primary/baby and permanent teeth. Invisalign First Phase 1 treatment provides early interceptive orthodontic treatment, traditionally done through arch expansion, or partial metal braces, before all permanent teeth have erupted. Invisalign First Phase 1 clear aligners are designed specifically to address a wide range of younger patients’ malocclusions, including shorter clinical crowns, management of erupting dentition and predictable dental arch expansion. Our Invisalign First Comprehensive Phase 2 Package complements Invisalign First Phase 1 and is generally consistent with our Invisalign Comprehensive Package. After a patient completes Invisalign First Phase 1, doctors have the option to purchase a Comprehensive Phase 2 Package for that same patient. 
In the first quarter of 2023, we launched the Invisalign Comprehensive 3in3 product. The 3in3 configuration offers doctors Invisalign Comprehensive treatment with a three-year treatment expiration date and three sets of additional clear aligners included prior to the treatment expiration date, rather than the five-year treatment expiration date with unlimited additional clear aligner sets prior to the treatment end date offered under the Invisalign Comprehensive Package. 
7
Non-Comprehensive Products - Invisalign Treatment Options:
Invisalign Non-comprehensive Packages. 
We offer a variety of lower-priced treatment packages for less complex orthodontic cases, non-comprehensive relapse cases, or teeth straightening prior to restorative or cosmetic treatments, such as veneers. These treatment packages include Invisalign Express, Invisalign Lite, and Invisalign
®
 Moderate. These packages may be offered in select countries and/or may differ from region to region. 
Invisalign Doctor Subscription Program (“DSP”) is our monthly subscription-based clear aligner program which includes retainers and low-stage “touch-up” clear aligner treatment. DSP is currently available in North America, Latin America, and certain countries in Europe. 
Invisalign Go Packages. 
In various markets we also offer Invisalign Go
TM
, Invisalign Go
TM
 Express and Invisalign Go Plus, which are streamlined non-comprehensive packages designed for GPs to more easily identify and treat patients with mild-to-moderate malocclusion cases, expand arch width, align anterior teeth prior to restorative treatment, and move teeth from second pre-molar to second pre-molar. These packages include case assessment support, simplified ClinCheck treatment plans and a progress assessment feature for case monitoring. 
Non-Case Products:
The Comprehensive and Non-Comprehensive clear aligner packages described above are distributed in cases, meaning that all the sets of clear aligners required for all the stages of a doctor-approved treatment plan are delivered in a case. We also sell non-case products. Clear aligner non-case products include retention products, Invisalign training, adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment, ancillary Invisalign Accessory Products and other oral health products available in certain e-commerce and retail channels in the United States.
Retention
. We offer up to four sets of custom clear aligners called Vivera retainers made with proprietary material strong enough to maintain tooth position and correct minor relapse, if necessary, as well as Invisalign retainers. Retainers are generally available for doctors to offer to any of their patients, whether they use the Invisalign System or other products, including wires and brackets. In select markets, we also offer single set retainers. 
Invisalign Professional Whitening System.
 Additionally, we offer a professional whitening system using Ultradent’s Opalescence PF whitening system with Invisalign
®
 clear aligners or Vivera retainers.
New Products/Feature Enhancement
Invisalign® Palatal Expander System.
 In December 2023, we received 510(k) clearance in the United States for the Invisalign Palatal Expanders. Invisalign Palatal Expanders are intended for use in rapid expansion and subsequent holding of skeletal and/or dental narrow maxilla (upper jaw) with primary, mixed, or permanent dentition. The Invisalign Palatal Expander System consists of a series of removable devices staged in small increments of movement to expand a patient’s narrow maxilla to a position determined by their treating doctor. Each direct 3D printed device is customized to the patient’s unique anatomy based on an iTero™ intraoral digital scan. A palatal expansion treatment plan and device design are then developed using our proprietary orthodontic software. The Invisalign Palatal Expander is our first direct 3D printed orthodontic device. Combined with Invisalign First™ Phase 1 clear aligners, Invisalign Palatal Expanders provide doctors with a full early intervention treatment solution such as Phase 1, an early interceptive orthodontic treatment for young patients. The Invisalign Palatal Expander System is currently available in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and certain countries in EMEA. The Invisalign Palatal Expander System is expected to be commercially available in additional markets, pending regulatory approvals. 
In January 2024, we completed the acquisition of Cubicure GmbH (“Cubicure”), a company that develops, produces and distributes innovative materials, equipment and processes for novel 3D printing solutions. We believe the acquisition of Cubicure will support our long-term growth strategy by enabling us to scale our 3D printing operations to eventually direct print millions of custom appliances per day. We expect the acquisition of Cubicure will ultimately extend and scale our printing, materials and manufacturing capabilities for our 3D printed products while concurrently materially reducing the amount of resin used in our manufacturing process. Direct fabrication offers the transformative potential of design flexibility that goes beyond what the current thermoforming technology allows. This will potentially allow us to design unique appliances 
8
that may perform even better than our existing ones and address unmet market needs. We expect to pilot our first devices on this platform with 3D printed retainers in the first half of 2025.
Smart Technology: SmartTrack
TM
, SmartForce
TM 
and SmartStage
TM
Smart technology is applied in the development of Invisalign treatments and leads to more precise control of individual and multiple tooth movements. We use a force driven system in our Invisalign clear aligners such that the next clear aligner is shaped so that when inserted, the clear aligner stretches and applies the desired force to the surface of the tooth, resulting in the desired tooth movement. Smart technology allows us to find the right thickness, the right elasticity, and the right force application over a period of time. Smart technology includes the use of SmartTrack, SmartForce and SmartStage Technology.
SmartTrack Material
. SmartTrack clear aligner material is a patented, custom-engineered Invisalign clear aligner material that provides gentle, more constant force to improve control of tooth movements. Conventional clear aligner materials relax and lose a substantial percentage of the force applied in the initial days of wear. SmartTrack material maintains more constant force over a longer period of time. The flexible SmartTrack material also more precisely conforms to tooth morphology, attachments and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement throughout treatment.
SmartForce Attachments
. SmartForce attachments are small tooth-colored shapes that attach to teeth before or during Invisalign treatment. Invisalign clear aligners fit smoothly and tightly around the attachments and give the clear aligners something to gently push on. SmartForce attachments make complex tooth movements possible without braces by helping clear aligners apply the right amount of force in the right direction.
SmartStage Technology
. SmartStage is an advanced algorithm that determines the optimal path of tooth movement and the shape of the clear aligner at every stage of an Invisalign treatment. The programming determines tooth movement in a certain sequence, at the right time to achieve optimal outcomes with greater predictability and fewer undesirable interferences.
Systems and Services Segment 
Intraoral scanning is a rapidly evolving technology substantially impacting the practice of dentistry. By enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3D image (digital scan) of a patient’s teeth using a handheld intraoral scanner, digital scanning is faster, more efficient, precise and comfortable for patients. Beginning patient care with the early use of our iTero intraoral scanners and combining the results with digital workflows designed to assist doctors and patients visualize and evaluate various treatment options with detailed imagery and CAD/CAM solutions helps patients decide to undergo treatment and improve treatment outcomes and satisfaction. The accuracy of digitally scanned models substantially reduces the rate of restoration “remakes,” which results in patients being recalled to dental offices less often and experiencing shorter treatment times for the restoration work because fewer procedures are required after teeth are aligned and spaced optimally, increasing overall patient satisfaction. Digital models also reduce the carbon footprint associated with the shipping of the materials used to create PVS impressions, the shipping of those impressions and their disposal. Moreover, the digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers, inlays, onlays, crowns, bridges and implant abutments; digital records storage; aid to caries detection; orthodontic diagnosis; orthodontic retainers and appliances; and Invisalign digital impression submission. 
iTero Scanner
. The iTero Element™ portfolio of intraoral scanners includes the iTero Element™ 2, the iTero Element™ Flex, iTero Element™ 5D Imaging System, iTero Element™ Plus Series and the iTero Lumina™ intraoral scanner which are each available in select regions and countries. These products build on the existing high precision, full-color imaging and fast scan times of the iTero Element portfolio and are available with software options for orthodontic and restorative procedures. The iTero scanner is interoperable with our Invisalign System such that a full arch or full mouth digital scan can be submitted as part of the Invisalign System prescription order submission process.
Our iTero Element 5D Imaging System is the first integrated dental imaging system that simultaneously records 3D, intraoral color camera images, near infrared imaging (“NIRI”) technology and enables comparison over time using the iTero™ TimeLapse technology. NIRI technology, included in our iTero Element 5D and 5D Plus Imaging Systems, aids in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries above the gingiva in real time, without using harmful radiation. In October 2021, the findings of a clinical study we sponsored were published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Dentistry which demonstrated that the NIRI technology of the iTero Element 5D imaging system was 66% more sensitive than bitewing x-ray radiography for detection of interproximal lesions, without the use of harmful radiation. We received 510(k) clearance in the United States for the caries detection feature of the iTero Element 5D in 2020. The iTero Element Plus Series of intraoral scanners and imaging systems offers restorative and orthodontic digital workflows that include enhanced visualization for optimized patient 
9
experience, including a fully integrated 3D intraoral camera in certain models, seamless scanning with reduced processing time, artificial intelligence (“AI”)-based features, and, in certain models, NIRI technology.
Our iTero Element scanners are offered in a number of software configurations such as Ortho Comprehensive, Restorative Comprehensive and Restorative Foundation. These software packages are included in the price of the scanner and have a service period of 1 to 5 years. They enable various orthodontic and restorative workflows as well as provide other applications, including Invisalign
®
 Outcome Simulator, Invisalign Case Assessment tool, Invisalign Progress Assessment tool, and iTero TimeLapse technology. Our iTero software is designed for orthodontists for digital records storage, orthodontic diagnosis, and for the fabrication of printed models and retainers. Our restorative software is designed for GPs, prosthodontists, periodontists and oral surgeons and includes restorative workflows providing the ability to send digital impressions to the lab of their choice and communicate seamlessly with external treatment planning, custom implant abutment, chairside milling and laboratory CAD/CAM systems such as through our iTero-exocad Connector
TM
. 
In January 2024, we launched the iTero Lumina intraoral scanner. The iTero Lumina intraoral scanner is designed with iTero Multi-Direct Capture
TM
 technology that we believe quickly, easily and accurately captures more data while delivering exceptional scan quality and photorealistic images that remove the need for intraoral photos. iTero Multi-Direct Capture replaces the confocal imaging technology in earlier intraoral scanner models. It has a wider field of capture and multi-angled scanning that enables simultaneous capture from multiple angles. Additionally, the iTero Lumina scanner has a capture distance of up to 25mm, making it easier to scan complex oral regions such as narrow or deep palates, edentulous spaces, and partially erupted teeth with minimal maneuvering. It has a 50% smaller and 45% lighter wand (as compared to iTero Element™ 5D imaging system wand, excluding the wand cable), which is expected to be especially beneficial for kids and teen patients. The iTero Lumina scanner has photorealistic scans which enables high quality clinical decisions the same way intraoral photos do, and its advanced software enables scanning at two times the speed. We expect to launch the restorative software on the iTero Lumina intraoral scanner by the end of the first quarter of 2025.
Invisalign® Outcome Simulator
. The Invisalign Outcome Simulator is an exclusive chair-side and cloud-based application for the iTero scanner that allows doctors to help patients visualize how their teeth may look at the end of Invisalign treatment. This is achieved through a dual view layout that shows a prospective patient an image of their own current dentition next to a simulated final position after Invisalign treatment.
Invisalign® Progress Assessment Tool. 
The Invisalign Progress Assessment tool provides the ability to compare a patient’s new scan with a specific stage of their ClinCheck
®
 treatment plan, allowing doctors to visually assess and communicate Invisalign treatment progress with an easy-to-read, color-coded, tooth movement report.
iTero
TM
 TimeLapse Technology
. Our iTero
TM
 TimeLapse technology allows doctors or practitioners to compare a patient’s historic 3D scans to the present-day scan, enabling clinicians to identify and measure orthodontic movement, tooth wear, and gingival recession. This highlights areas of diagnostic interest to dental professionals and helps foster a proactive conversation with the patient regarding potential restorative or orthodontic solutions.
Align
TM
 Oral Health Suite
. The Align™ Oral Health Suite is a digital interface designed to enhance dental consultations and drive patient acceptance of dental treatment. It offers a modern approach to dental examinations, featuring an innovative clinical framework designed to empower doctors and their clinic staff to conduct comprehensive oral health assessments via a single scan using patient-friendly terminology, and providing a highly engaging patient-centric experience. It integrates iTero diagnostic aid and visualization tools, such as iTero NIRI, iTero Occlusogram, iTero TimeLapse and Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro into a single interface chairside on the iTero scanner.
CAD/CAM Service
s. Our exocad CAD/CAM software platform addresses restorative needs in an end-to-end digital platform workflow to facilitate ortho-restorative and comprehensive dentistry. The platform provides doctors and dental labs with digital clinical solutions that aid GPs and dental labs in planning and delivering restorative dental treatments, adding restorative functionality to our comprehensive digital platform to deliver digital ortho-restorative workflows and interdisciplinary dentistry.

We strive to enable GPs, who have the potential to treat the general patient population, to more easily identify potential cases they can treat with the Invisalign System, monitor patient progress or, if needed, help refer cases to an orthodontist while providing high-quality restorative, orthodontic and dental hygiene care. We believe success with GPs can be achieved through doctor training and clinical education, by offering digital tools such as the iTero intraoral scanner and products like Invisalign Go™ treatment that address the distinctive needs of GP patients, all delivered by sales and marketing personnel specifically focused on the unique needs of this customer category. We encourage GPs to scan every patient with intraoral scanners as a means to diagnose and treat patients over time and as an opportunity to drive future demand for their services and the Invisalign System. DSOs represent a large and growing opportunity to help drive adoption of digital technology across the dental industry. We have well established relationships with many DSOs globally that recognize the benefits of digital workflows enabled by our portfolio of products and services that make up the Align
TM
 Digital Platform, including increased practice efficiency and profitability, as well as delivering a better patient experience from shorter cycle times and customer proximity. We have and may continue to financially invest in or explore collaborations with key ecosystem partners, including DSOs, whose missions and visions align with our own vision, strategy, business model and goals.

Patient Demand.
 Our goal is to make the Invisalign brand a highly recognized name brand worldwide by creating awareness for Invisalign treatment among consumers and motivating the potential 600 million patients who can benefit from treatment of malocclusion to seek treatment using the Invisalign System. We accomplish this through an integrated consumer marketing strategy that includes television, media, social networking and event marketing and strategic alliances with professional sports teams, as well as educating patients on treatment options and directing them to high volume Invisalign trained doctors. To further drive consumer awareness, we continue to offer additional dental-related Invisalign Accessory Products under the Invisalign brand name available in certain e-commerce channels in the United States. The initial stage of the Align
TM
 Digital Platform drives consumer demand and connects potential patients to our websites and the websites of Invisalign providers. Some of the tools that support this stage are Invisalign.com, the Invisalign SmileViewTM tool, My Invisalign app, Doctor Locator, Invisalign® Practice App, and Invisalign® Virtual Appointment. The Align
TM
 Digital Platform also facilitates the doctor-patient conversation, through education regarding clinical needs and setting expectations. Some of the tools that support this stage include 
11
Align™ Oral Health Suite, that integrates iTero diagnostic aid and visualization tools, such as iTero NIRI, iTero Occlusogram, iTero TimeLapse and Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro with multiple treatment plans.
•
Orthodontist Utilization.
 We continue to innovate and increase product applicability and predictability to address a wide range of cases, from simple to complex, thereby enabling doctors to confidently diagnose and treat children and adults with the Invisalign System. This is especially important to treating teenage patients who make up the largest portion of the 22 million annual orthodontic case starts. We also continue to make improvements to our Invisalign treatment software, ClinCheck Pro, designed to deliver an exceptional user experience and increase treatment control to help doctors achieve their treatment goals. In combination with the new Invisalign System innovations that are part of the Align
TM
 Digital Platform, we are enhancing the digital treatment planning experience for orthodontics by providing doctors with greater flexibility, consistency of treatment preferences and real-time treatment plan access and modification capabilities. 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We have regional fabrication facilities in our main markets for clear aligners, which are located in Juarez, Mexico; Ziyang, China; and Wroclaw, Poland. We believe this allows us to better serve our global customer base by being closer to our doctor customers and driving efficiencies in the business. We produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand, perform final scanner assembly and repair our scanners at our facilities in Ziyang, China and Petah Tikva, Israel and also perform final scanner assembly in Blonie, Poland and Juarez, Mexico; as well as service and repair certain scanners in Juarez, Mexico. 
We also perform digital treatment planning and interpretation for restorative cases based on digital scans generated by our iTero intraoral scanners. Our digital treatment planning facilities are located worldwide, including in Costa Rica, China, Germany, Spain, Poland and Japan, among other international locations.
Our quality system is required to be in compliance with the Quality System regulations enforced by the FDA, and similar regulations of other worldwide regulatory authorities. We are certified to ISO 13485:2016, an internationally recognized standard for medical device quality. We are routinely audited by third-party certification bodies as well as global health authorities for compliance to this standard and other international regulations. We maintain a formal, documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined, understood and achieved. Systems, processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality. We monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes, taking corrective action, as needed.
Since the mass-customized treatment planning and manufacturing processes of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise, we believe our manufacturing capacity and capabilities are important to our success. In order to produce our highly-customized, highly-precise, medical quality products in volume, we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies. These include complex software algorithms and solutions, including AI and machine-learning based CAD/CAM software, vision systems, CT scanning, stereolithography and automated custom clear aligner fabrication equipment. To increase the efficiency and yield of our manufacturing processes, we continue to focus our efforts on software development, equipment development and the improvement of rate-limiting processes or bottlenecks. In addition, we have invested in developing technologies that will allow us to directly print the devices that may help us improve and streamline the processes as well as the performance of devices. We continuously upgrade our proprietary, three-dimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case, thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians. Moreover, to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations, we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of clear aligners.
In addition, predictable and consistent production is essential to our commitment to timely deliver products to our customers efficiently and profitably. Our production can be disrupted by such things as supply chain and shipping issues, production manufacturing software system issues, quality and safety issues, and production equipment downtime. Accordingly, as we have grown our operations, we have included flexibility and resiliency in our overall manufacturing design to mitigate the risks of production downtime. Our manufacturing facilities include backup generators and systems and each facility has an emergency response plan that is part of ongoing employee training and testing through recurring cross functional scenario-based simulation exercises. Likewise, having manufacturing facilities in key regions provides us with greater flexibility and capacity to adjust and redirect production to one or more of our production facilities as needed.
As part of our manufacturing resiliency design efforts, we have also considered climate change and climate-related risks such as higher average global temperatures, rising sea levels and more frequent and severe wildfires, hurricanes, floods, winter storms, heat waves and other events and natural disasters (collectively, “climate-related risks”). We view climate-related risks to be one of many operational challenges we face and factor them into our business continuity planning and strategic risk mitigation efforts. 
12
For instance, our manufacturing plants and operations may be impacted by extreme temperatures and weather, subjecting us to potential brownouts and blackouts, increased energy costs and capital investments needed to maintain ideal operating temperatures. Our manufacturing facility in Juarez, Mexico is located in an area classified as high-water stress and our operations could be impacted by water shortages, rationing and droughts. Our California, Costa Rica, Mexico and North Carolina operations are located in areas that have historically been impacted by extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornados, wildfires or flooding. 
In part to help mitigate risks to our manufacturing operations, we have strategically located our clear aligner production facilities in three facilities on different continents. This allows us to both respond more quickly to customer demand while also offering redundancy in the event natural disasters or climate-related events affect operations at one or more facilities. Moreover, each of our three key clear aligner manufacturing facilities are located at elevations less likely to be impacted by rising sea levels and at least two hundred miles inland.
Moreover, we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment, rapid prototyping machines, resin and other advanced materials for our clear aligners, as well as the optics, electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners. We maintain single or sole source supplier relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies. In particular, our CT scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our clear aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single or sole source suppliers. We also currently purchase our resin and polymer, the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners, from a single source. A discussion of the risks of our supply and manufacturing operations, including foreign operations, may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “
Risk Factors
.”
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on increasing adoption and utilization of the Invisalign System and Vivera retainers by orthodontists and GPs worldwide and integrating the iTero scanner and services and exocad CAD/CAM products into dental labs and practices. The iTero scanner is an important component to the customer experience and is central to a digital approach as well as overall customer utilization of Invisalign clear aligners. In each region, we have direct sales, marketing and support organizations, which include quota carrying sales representatives, sales management and sales administration. We also have distribution partners in certain markets. Our sales and marketing personnel are organized primarily to support orthodontists and GPs separately, allowing highly trained and specialized personnel to serve each customer channel, thereby increasing our focus and effectiveness on both. We continue to expand in existing markets through targeted investments in sales resources, professional marketing and education programs. Additionally, our consumer marketing programs are designed to create awareness and educate consumers on the benefits of Invisalign treatment and Vivera retainers, including where they can find trained doctors to provide treatment.
We provide training, marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and GPs. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 130,370 active Invisalign-trained doctors. We define doctors as active if they have submitted at least one Invisalign case in the prior 12-month period.
Research and Development
We are committed to investing in world-class digital technology development, which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the Invisalign System as the standard method for treating malocclusion, our iTero intraoral scanners as the preferred scanning technology for digital dental scans, and our exocad CAD/CAM software as the solution of choice for dental labs.
Our research and development activities are directed toward developing digital technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and solutions as part of the Align
TM
 Digital Platform. These activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation, to developing manufacturing process improvements, to researching future technologies, products and software.
In an effort to demonstrate the broad treatment capabilities of the Invisalign System, more than 200 peer-reviewed publications and various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of Invisalign treatment to malocclusion cases, including addressing malocclusions of severe complexity. Similarly, various studies have also been published demonstrating the capabilities of our scanners, including advanced features such as our NIRI technology. We undertake pre-commercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to our products and manufacturing process. We furthermore fund research in the field of orthodontics and dentistry through initiatives such as our 
13
Annual Research Award Program, which was in its 15th year in 2024 and donations to the American Association of Orthodontists Foundation. 
Intellectual Property 
We believe our intellectual property portfolio represents a substantial business advantage. As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,000 active U.S. patents, 1,063 active foreign patents, and 1,012 pending global patent applications. Our active U.S. patents expire between 2025 and 2043. When patents expire, we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provide, which could negatively impact our operating results; however, as we continue to pursue new innovations, we seek intellectual property protection for new inventions and know-how through U.S. and foreign patent applications and non-disclosure agreements. We also seek to protect our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. We furthermore have a broad and diverse trademark portfolio that we use to highlight and protect our universally recognized brands. Information regarding risks associated with our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in Part I, Item 1A

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading
 “Risk Factors.”
Seasonal Fluctuations
General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and we have historically experienced seasonal trends within our two operating segments, customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve. Sales of the Invisalign System are often weaker in Europe, especially southern European countries during the summer months and seasonally higher in China during the third quarter. Similarly, other international holidays like Lunar New Year can impact our sales in APAC in the first quarter. In North America, summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents start their children in treatment before the school year begins. Conversely, many GPs are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases. For our Systems and Services segment, capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. However, many of these typical seasonal patterns have been impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates, military conflicts, inflation and other macroeconomic challenges. It remains unclear when or if these seasonal fluctuations will return to historical norms. Consequently, seasonal trends have and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.
Competition
 Competition in the clear aligner market continues to increase. Our clear aligner products compete directly against traditional orthodontic treatments that use metal brackets and wires and increasingly against clear aligner products manufactured and distributed by various companies, both within and outside the United States. Although the number of competitors varies by segment, product, geography and customer, they include new and well-established regional competitors in certain foreign markets, as well as larger companies, divisions of larger companies or well-capitalized new entrants with substantial sales, marketing, research and financial capabilities. We also compete with direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) companies that provide clear aligners directly to the consumer requiring little or no in-office care from doctors and also from doctors themselves who can manufacture retainers and custom clear aligners using 3D printing technology. In addition, corresponding foreign patents began expiring in 2018 which has increased competition outside the United States. 
Additionally, we face competition in the rapidly evolving markets for intraoral scanners and software solutions, including CAD/CAM. The global intraoral scanner market is very dynamic with participants spanning from traditional dental conglomerates to companies dedicated primarily to scanner development and sales with new entrants playing larger roles. The iTero intraoral scanner also competes with traditional PVS impressions that doctors use for clear aligner therapy or other dental procedures, as well as other intraoral scanners. It also competes with traditional bite wing 2D dental x-rays for detecting interproximal caries. Information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “
Risk Factors
.” 
We believe we are well positioned to compete in the markets we target. We have thousands of dedicated, highly skilled sales force employees who are focused on key demographics in our target markets that allow us to uniquely address customer needs and thereby enhance the customer experience. Our significant historical and ongoing investments in research and development and design around the movement of teeth, SmartTrack aligner materials and design, intraoral scanning, 3D manufacturing, global scale of manufacturing and treatment planning, strong brand name recognition, strong workforce, diversified and knowledgeable customer base, geographic expansion, reliable financial results, leading digital platform, technology and IP, next wave of innovation with direct 3D printing and innovations powered by AI enabling more personalized care, and regulatory clearance of our products are among a few of our key competitive factors that compare favorably with our competitors’ products and services.

Government Regulations 
Many countries throughout the world have established regulatory frameworks for commercialization of medical devices. As a designer, manufacturer, and marketer of medical devices, we are obligated to comply with the respective frameworks of these countries to obtain and maintain access to these global markets. 
The frameworks often define requirements for marketing authorizations which vary by country. Failure to obtain appropriate marketing authorization and to meet all local requirements, including specific quality and safety standards and new software and AI standards in any country in which we currently market our products, could cause commercial disruption and/or subject us to sanctions and fines. Delays in receipt of, or a failure to receive, such marketing authorizations, or the loss of any previously received authorizations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
With regards to premarket authorization in the United States, many of our products are classified as medical devices under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”). The FD&C Act requires these products, when sold in the United States, to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with medical device regulations defined by the FDA. The regulatory framework depends on a set of written processes for ensuring consistent quality called a Quality Management System (“QMS”) coupled with a product marketing authorization which depends on the risk classification of the product. This regulatory framework is comparable to the framework established in the European Union (“EU”). Within the EU, our products are subject to the requirements defined by the Medical Device Regulation EU 2017/745 which replaced the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC with a final transition date of May 26, 2021. Similar market access regulations exist in Brazil, China, Japan and other countries. Our QMS is routinely audited by certification bodies as well as country regulators for compliance with applicable regulations. We believe we are in material compliance with all state, federal, and international regulatory requirements applicable to our products.
We are also subject to various laws around the world that govern interactions with our customers as healthcare professionals or government officials. The laws govern different interactions and may include: prohibiting improper influence of or payments to healthcare professionals, other decision makers or purchasers of medical devices and government officials; setting out rules for when and how to engage healthcare professionals; marketing our products within the regulatory approval (e.g., on label) promotion, sale and marketing of our products and services; the importing and exporting of our products; the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products; and disclosure of payments to healthcare professionals and institutions. As we expand our operations footprint, countries to which we sell and invest in new business models, compliance with applicable laws becomes more complex and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement. 
Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies, and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business. It is not possible to predict at this time whether these trends will impact our business or the potential cost containment measures on our future business.
Our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by state or federal funded programs such as Medicaid, a foreign national healthcare program, or private pay insurance, each of which may offer some degree of oversight. As a medical device manufacturer and seller, we are subject to transparency reporting laws (also known as sunshine laws) that in certain countries and U.S. states require us to report transfers of value to healthcare professionals that perform services or receive other items from us (e.g., meals, travel, branded promotional or educational items, or other benefits of value). Enforcement actions and associated efforts to respond or defend against enforcement actions can be expensive, and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
In addition, we must comply with numerous laws and regulations addressing privacy, data protection, data governance and cyber security. Many of these laws and regulations do or will soon regulate or restrict cross-border data transfers, such as in the United States, the EU, Switzerland, Brazil, China, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and other countries. Further, in the United States, we may be required to comply with laws and regulations addressing the collection, use, security and processing of protected health information and other information relating to individuals, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and its implementing rules. The HIPAA Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information (“Privacy Standards”) and the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information under HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH Act”) (the “Security Standards”) are the subjects of final and proposed rule amendments, respectively, reflecting the rapidly evolving nature of these laws and regulations. Additionally, many U.S. states maintain laws and regulations addressing privacy, data protection, data governance and cybersecurity. Like many other companies, we must work to ensure our global privacy program framework incorporates applicable requirements of new and modified laws and regulations in relevant jurisdictions to support our efforts to ensure that our product innovations and our associated practices comply with these increasingly complex laws and regulations.
15
Legislatures and regulators globally are proposing, and in certain cases have enacted, new laws or regulations regarding privacy, data protection, data governance and cybersecurity that could require us to modify our policies and practices in order to comply with new and evolving obligations relating to these matters. Information regarding risks associated with data security and privacy may be found in Part I, Item 1A

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “
Risk Factors
.”
Environmental Laws and Regulations
We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws, including provisions that regulate the purchase, use, distribution, and environmental impact of hazardous substances used in our operations, contained within our products and the packaging associated with our products. We are also subject to environmental laws applicable to our manufacturing facilities and operations, including environmental health, safety and sustainability regulations. The number and rate at which these regulations are being proposed and implemented are increasing at the regional, country and local territorial levels, requiring greater diligence, governance and skills to manage. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with existing and new laws and regulations in the future. Information regarding risks associated with environmental laws and regulations may be found in Part I, Item 1A

Human Capital 
We believe our culture and commitment to employees provide unique value that benefits Align, its stockholders and the communities and other stakeholders we serve. Every employee, and every job, is important to our success and helps us achieve our purpose of transforming smiles and changing lives. Align is committed to building a global workforce with varied cultural backgrounds and life experiences. Fostering a culture of dignity, integrity, open dialogue, open-mindedness, compassion, fairness, recognition, and shared goals allows us to attract and retain the best talent, and provide a safe and supportive environment that allows our employees to excel.
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 20,945 employees, a decrease of approximately 3.1% and 9.6% over December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The number of employees for each of the last five years and our employees’ roles as of December 31, 2024 are as follows: 

We are fundamentally a global organization with approximately 91% of our employees located internationally, primarily in direct-labor roles in our manufacturing and clinical treatment planning facilities. Set forth in the following paragraphs are some of the most important elements of our culture and commitment to our employees.
Governance
. Our commitment to improving the lives of our employees and the communities in which we live and work, including conducting our business ethically, responsibly and transparently through open and clear disclosures that allow us and others to hold us accountable, begins with our Board of Directors (“Board”) and management team. They set the tone for our organization by establishing and clearly communicating our core values of Agility, Customer and Accountability that inform our culture. Our Global Code of Conduct (“Code”) and quality policies are designed to enable us to operate with integrity and deliver superior treatment outcomes and experiences to patients. We seek to create an environment that values the health, safety and well-being of our teams, and we work to equip them with the knowledge and skills to serve our business and develop their careers. We believe that by effectively managing our business with these values as the foundation, we will drive long-term value for our stockholders and all stakeholders.
As part of our Board’s commitment to our employees and communities, our Board has delegated oversight responsibility of our policies and practices that foster Align’s sustainability and cultural initiatives, policies, practices, and programs to our 
16
Nominating and Governance Committee. Additionally, our Compensation and Human Capital Committee has oversight responsibilities of all human capital management strategies, programs and policies. Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee regularly reviews and discusses key performance indicators regarding human capital management that allow it to monitor trends on issues such as total headcount, employee hiring, recruiting, attrition, career development, compensation, benefits, workplace culture, and other measures of employee engagement and interest to management and the committee. 
We believe our success continues to be driven by our focus on integrating and welcoming employees across the globe and of all different backgrounds, orientations, beliefs, perspectives and capabilities into our workforce. Our employees bring a positive mix of ethnic and culturally diverse backgrounds to the 47 different countries in which we operate. Our largest population of employees work in Mexico followed by Costa Rica and China. Employees in the United States represent approximately 9% of our global population. 
Our management team is comprised of individuals from varying countries and nationalities who are committed to promoting and encouraging the health and well-being of our employees at work, at home and in society in general. 
Our work culture is designed to create financial, health, career and personal benefits for our employees and organization. We sponsor cultural recognition events to increase awareness of inclusion and belonging, including its importance in creating an environment where every employee is safe, supported and can thrive.
Our employees have also established and manage employee groups including employee resource groups which are based on shared characteristics or life experiences. These are open to all employees, including those who do not directly identify with other members.
Talent Recruitment and Engagement.
 W
e employ a variety of career development, employee benefits, compensation and other policies and programs designed to attract, develop and retain employees. We focus on building a talent pipeline that nurtures those early in their careers, encourages continuous learning and growth, and incentivizes employees to stay and contribute to our success over the long term. Our programs include early recruitment at high schools and universities, initiatives such as internships, co-ops, apprenticeships, and training programs, quarterly performance management check-ins focused on individual goals and commitment to values and conducting regular employee surveys to build trust and strengthen relationships. 
Our efforts have resulted in numerous awards for our positive work environment and culture. Some of the certifications, awards and recognitions recognized or received in 2024 and 2025 include:

We believe it is imperative to provide a vibrant employee experience and we value our employees’ collective voices. Accordingly, we conduct employee surveys that utilizes a continuous employee listening strategy.to collect employee feedback critical to improving our culture. This listening strategy includes globally managed pulse surveys, employee lifecycle surveys, and a self-service feature to support listening efforts. We use what we learn from the surveys to improve the employee experience, including enhancements to our workplaces, focus on employee connections, increased career development opportunities, support for relocated employees, and growth in our recognition programs and experiences. Our global response rates are consistently high, reflecting strong engagement by our employees.
Training and Professional Development
. Training is an integral part of developing and retaining our employees and creating a culture of leadership within Align. 
Training at Align begins with our Code and our strong commitment to ethical business practices in all aspects of our operations. Every employee and contractor is required to review the Code and confirm they understand and will comply with it. We routinely reference the Code in presentations and as part of everyday operations. 
As a further part of our standard onboarding program, we train employees on important environmental health and safety topics to protect them and the environment. As a general practice, employees are trained to perform their jobs in accordance with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and that training is routinely refreshed and re-administered. 
At Align, we believe employees learn best when skill development is driven by the changing and immediate needs of our employees and by empowering all employees to take action and ownership of their careers. We also believe learning should be relevant and actionable as well as rooted in our purpose and values. Develop@Align enables our global employee population to access a diverse portfolio of approximately 1,800 self-directed courses in up to 80 languages. We also offer a full suite of custom leadership development programs, beginning with aspiring leaders, continuing with managers and directors, and culminating with executive development opportunities. 
We also recognize we must continually evolve by providing employees with the resources they need to continue to learn, grow, and thrive. To this end, we created Voyage. Voyage is a global initiative that offers a set of tools, resources and a new mindset, empowering employees to start thinking differently about career growth by embracing development opportunities in new and sometimes unexpected ways. Our Voyage Compass helps employees experience their career through four distinct lenses: Self, Networks, Experience and Skills. Since its launch in 2022, over 45% of the population has interacted with Voyage, and there have been over 140,000 visits to the Voyage website. In addition to our navigation site, we annually host two Voyage Set Sail weeks, where we offer experiential learning for individuals and teams utilizing activities that keep professional development front and center in employees’ minds.
Compensation and Benefits
. Our benefit and compensation programs reflect the value and contributions our employees make. In addition to competitive base pay, we offer an assortment of benefits that vary by country, roles and contributions, including performance-based variable compensation programs, health and welfare benefit plans, retirement planning services and benefits, holiday and leave policies, equity participation programs such as our 2005 Annual Incentive Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and charitable and community service opportunities. We also offer discounts to our employees and their dependents who undergo Invisalign treatment. 
We are furthermore committed to pay equity practices. We exceed minimum pay requirements for our manufacturing employees and regularly review our pay equity practices globally and locally to address discrepancies.
Health, Wellness and Safety
. Our employees’ health and well-being is critical to our success and their continuing achievements. We therefore offer a wide variety of robust programs and initiatives designed to promote the overall health and welfare of all our employees and their families. Every year, we sponsor the Month of Wellness, a month dedicated to well-being and a worldwide movement fostering employee health across our organization. Throughout the Month of Wellness, employees participate in a variety of activities such as informational sessions and health fairs and receive useful resources aligned to our wellness pillars - mental resilience, physical well-being and healthy living, social/family connections, and financial wellness. This provides employees with a variety of meaningful ways to embrace wellness and well-being through mindfulness, meditation, nutrition and mental wellness activities, exercise, hikes, yoga, volunteer activities, financial education sessions, social events and stress management.
Additionally, a primary objective is to prevent injuries and occupational diseases by focusing first and foremost on creating and maintaining safe environments. 
We have e
nvironmental, health, safety and sustainability personnel who are 
18
responsible for ensuring health and safety programs and processes are maintained and effective at each of our locations. Major worksites, such as our clear aligner fabrication sites, and large offices have dedicated Environmental Health and Safety (“EHS”) departments which are dedicated to ensuring our health and safety programs are maintained 
while contributing Best Management Practices and general input to corporate-wide programs.
 Each EHS department is responsible for ensuring all employees at their location are properly trained on various EHS topics and at the appropriate frequencies. A training suite is determined for each employee depending on their responsibilities and function modeled off ISO 45001. 
Community.
 We actively encourage employees to support charitable organizations by providing opportunities for volunteerism, team building, and donation and matching programs. In 
2024
, our employees continued to make us proud through their generosity and dedication, especially during our annual Month of Smiles initiative in October where we encourage them to make a difference individually and as teams through volunteer activities, charitable donations, fundraising, and intentional acts of goodness. In addition, through our Align Foundation, we support organizations whose visions closely align with our mission to improve smiles, supporting and educating teens, and empowering our customers through partnerships with learning institutions and foundations. Below are some of our key community initiatives in 
2024
:
•
Since 2013 we have been a proud supporter of Operation Smile, a global medical nonprofit that has provided hundreds of thousands of free surgeries for people born with cleft lips and cleft palates in low and middle-income countries. For the fourth year, we sponsored Operation Smile’s International Student Leadership Conference, a powerful opportunity for youth in high schools and colleges around the world to develop leadership skills and impact their communities. As part of our 2024 sponsorship, we provided full scholarships for 74 participants and students personally impacted with a cleft condition. In addition, we covered a portion of the conference fee for all students to make this opportunity more accessible for all attendees. As of December 31, 2024, we had donated approximately $3.0 million to Operation Smile.
•
As part of Align’s commitment to improving oral health, we partnered with the INCAE Business School as they relaunched the CAHI Jeffe Fellowship in Health and Innovation to improve health services in Latin America. The CAHI Jeffe Fellowship brought together 23 leaders from six Latin American countries and focused on enhancing the quality, accessibility, and affordability of health services through a variety of programs. Align provided scholarships to two leaders from the program who focused on oral health education and expansion of dental health for low-income populations.
•
For 17 years we have supported America’s ToothFairy, an organization with a mission to ensure underserved children in the United States have access to dental care and learn about oral health by supporting nonprofit clinics and community partners. As of December 31, 2024, we have provided almost $2 million for the foundation’s operational expenses and children’s oral health programs. As Title Sponsor of the HERO Program since 2019, we have helped the program reach an estimated 2.7 million children, caregivers, and parents. During America’s ToothFairy’s 2024 fiscal year, which ended June 30th, the HERO Program positively impacted more than 900,000 children and caregivers, including: 
◦
More than 600,000 children—33,500 of whom speak a language other than English—who were reached with downloadable resources accessed from AmericasToothFairy.org,
◦
