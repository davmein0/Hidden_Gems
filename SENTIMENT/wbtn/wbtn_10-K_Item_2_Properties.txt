Item 2. Properties
Our corporate headquarters, consisting of approximately 22,296 square feet of office space in Los Angeles, California, is leased through 2025. We lease additional office space in Korea, Japan and Canada. We also operate several data centers in Korea, Singapore, Germany and the U.S. pursuant to various lease agreements. 
We intend to lease additional space as we add employees and expand geographically. We believe our facilities are adequate and suitable for our current needs and that, should it be needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate any expansion of our operations.
