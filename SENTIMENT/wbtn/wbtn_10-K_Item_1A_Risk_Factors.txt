Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
This section of this Annual Report generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Annual Report can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Form S-1/A (File No. 333-279863) which was declared effective by the SEC on June 26, 2024. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Overview
WEBTOON is a global storytelling platform where a vibrant community of creators and users discover, create and share new content. We have pioneered a cultural movement by revolutionizing the storytelling format and democratizing content creation and publication. WEBTOON empowers creators, by enabling them to participate economically in their own creation, and users, by offering an endless library of content. 
Content
 on our platform tells stories, across formats. On our platform, creators tell long-form stories through serialized narratives in the form of short-form, bite-sized episodes, creating a habitual behavior with an engaged user base. These stories are primarily told in two ways—web-comics, a graphical comic-like medium, and web-novels, which are text-based stories. The web-comic medium tells stories using a continuous vertical-scroll format that is easily read on mobile devices. We are able to extend the reach, impact and monetization of our content by adapting it into other media formats such as film, streaming series, games, merchandise and print books.
Creators
 power our content engine by authoring immersive visual stories, developing imaginative new characters and inspiring fandoms. Our creator base ranges from the individual enthusiast with a love of storytelling to the professional author building a brand and an enterprise on our platform. WEBTOON provides creators with an opportunity to monetize their creativity through various means, including Paid Content, advertising and IP Adaptations.
Users
 come to our platform to discover and consume engaging and immersive content. Our creators tell stories that are relatable to global audiences, attracting users across age groups, geographies and genders. Our primary user base is Gen Z and millennials. WEBTOON helps fans discover engaging content across genres, with fresh, weekly releases. 
Community
 reinforces the benefits to creators and users on our platform. We help users and creators build relationships and engage with one another over content. As users, or “fans,” often develop a personal connection to the titles on our platform, they relish the direct engagement with creators through both our comments section at the end of each episode and the “Creator Profile” section, where creators can post messages and users can respond directly. Fans also appreciate the ability to potentially influence how stories unfold and how their favorite characters evolve, as creators may choose to incorporate fans’ feedback. This enables a positive feedback loop for content creation and user engagement. This community engagement powers a flywheel of user engagement and creator readership, which in turn drives WEBTOON’s success. 
Our platform continuously empowers and incentivizes creators to drive creation of unique long-form stories. These stories are enjoyed on our platform by a growing base of loyal fans and importantly, enable us to expand the audience base off-platform over time. This continuous cycle results in successful and durable franchises within our ever-growing content library, empowering us with a multitude of monetization opportunities through IP Adaptations. 
Key Business Metrics 
We believe our performance is dependent upon many factors, including the key metrics described below that we track and review to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. 
Our offerings include WEBTOON, LINE MANGA, NAVER SERIES, eBookJapan, Munpia and Wattpad. We manage our business by tracking several operating metrics, including: monthly active users, or MAU; monthly paying users, or MPU; and Paid Content Average Revenue per Paying User, or ARPPU. For a definition of these operating 
54
Table of Contents
metrics, please see the “Glossary.” As a management team, we believe each of these operating metrics provides useful information to investors and others. 
Our year-over-year activity and quarter-over-quarter growth trends may fluctuate subject to various internal and external factors including (i) seasonality of our business where we see increased activity during holiday season, (ii) magnitude of our marketing campaigns, (iii) hiatus/return of creators and key titles on our platforms, (iv) TV shows, films, and/or gaming release based on our content as part of our IP Adaptation business, (v) our strategic decision to direct traffic to our mobile application may lead to fluctuations in trends as web users who view in both mediums may choose to continue to consume on our mobile application only and (vi) external factors impacting the global economy, our industry and our company. 
Geographic Tracking 
We review each metric by geography where our products are available and accessible. We categorize geographies into Korea, Japan, and Rest of World (“ROW”) based on the location of our users: 
•
Korea
 includes WEBTOON Korea, NAVER SERIES, and Munpia where our content is in Korean and targeted at Korean speaking users. 
•
Japan 
includes LINE MANGA and eBookJapan where our content is in Japanese and targeted at Japanese speaking users. 
•
Rest of World
 includes WEBTOON in all other languages including English, Spanish, and more, as well as Wattpad, where our content is targeted at global users outside of Korea and Japan. 
In particular, as a proxy for tracking our performance in North America, which we consider to be a key market, amongst Rest of World, we track users who consume WEBTOON offered in English in the U.S. and Canada based on such user’s Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (collectively “WEBTOON North America”). For clarity, the following cases are not counted as part of WEBTOON North America but counted as part of Rest of World: (i) where users consume non-English (e.g., Spanish) WEBTOON content while they are physically based in North America and (ii) where users consume non-WEBTOON products (e.g., Wattpad) while they are physically based in North America. 
Our methodology of geographic tracking may include an immaterial number of users not geographically located within the above segmentation. For instance, where users consume WEBTOON Korea content while they are physically based outside of Korea, the users will be counted as part of Korea. While we believe that these metrics are reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, and that the methodologies we employ and update from time-to-time to create these metrics are reasonable bases to identify trends in user behavior, the preparation of each of such metrics involves the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions, and our metrics may be materially affected if such estimates, judgments or good faith assumptions prove to be inaccurate. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations—Our user metrics and other estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics could adversely affect our business and reputation.” 
Trends in Monthly Active Users (MAU) 
We define MAU as users based on each device logged in and each offering accessed from a single device and may include the same individual user multiple times if the user is logged in from multiple devices or if the user accesses multiple offerings from one device. 
We track MAU as an indicator of the scale of our active user base, user engagement and adoption. We also break out MAU by geographic region to help us understand the global engagement. 
As of the year ended December 31, 2024, our global MAU was approximately 166 million. The global MAU decreased by approximately 1.5% compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to decreases in ROW MAU driven by a government ban on Wattpad in one country, and slight decreases in Korea MAU. These decreases were offset by continued growth in Japan.  By geographic regions, Korea, Japan, and Rest of World contributed 14.6%, 13.2%, and 72.2% of global MAU, respectively.
•
In Korea, our MAU was approximately 24.4 million as of the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to MAU of 24.9 million as of the year ended December 31, 2023. Our user base in Korea is highly engaged, and our cohorts have demonstrated deeper engagement and levels of consumption over time. Our decrease in 
55
Table of Contents
MAU for the year ended December 31, 2024, was driven largely by short-term engagement impacts from political turbulence in Korea.
•
In Japan, our MAU have reached 21.9 million as of the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to MAU of 21.2 million as of the year ended December 31, 2023, largely attributable to growth of LINE Manga and local Japanese title launches. In addition, we continued to optimize and improve our existing AI-based personalized content recommendation capabilities. 
•
In Rest of World, our MAU was approximately 120.1 million as of the year ended December 31, 2024, which declined from 122.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The decline was primarily attributable to decline in web users. We do not monetize web users in North America, which is why we are focused on converting users to the app. The MAU for the Rest of World is a relatively larger portion compared to Korea and Japan as it includes Wattpad, which has a large global user base. Roughly two-thirds of the decline was isolated to one country where the government banned a number of global content sites, including Wattpad. 
Trends in Monthly Paying Users (MPU) 
We define MPU as users who have paid to access Paid Content in the applicable calendar month, averaged over each month in the given period. We define paying ratio as the ratio of MPU divided by MAU for the respective periods.  
We view MPU and paying ratio to be indicators of the strength of our monetization. 
As of the year ended December 31, 2024, our global MPU reached 7.7 million with a paying ratio of 4.6%, which is a slight increase compared to the paying ratio for the year ended December 31, 2023. By geographic regions, Korea, Japan, and Rest of World contributed 48.6%, 29.0% and 22.4% of global MPU, respectively. Paying ratio varies due to the user’s ability and propensity to pay across different regions and different product offerings. 
•
In Korea, our MPU have decreased to around 3.7 million with a paying ratio of 15.4%, compared to MPU of 4.1 million and a paying ratio of 16.3% as of the year ended December 31, 2023.
•
In Japan, our MPU have reached 2.2 million with a paying ratio of 10.2%, compared to MPU of 2.0 million and a paying ratio of 9.2% as of the year ended December 31, 2023.
•
In Rest of World, our MPU is 1.7 million with a paying ratio of 1.4%, which has remained similar to the year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting our current strategic plans and marketing discipline to focus on select markets for long-term value creation. Our paying ratio is relatively lower as compared to Korea or Japan due to the inclusion of Wattpad. Wattpad has a different monetization model that primarily focuses on advertising and the business is in its early stage of monetizing its content. We plan to continue to leverage our successful pattern of engagement to drive monetization, especially as we have seen our highly engaged users in North America reading a similar number of episodes to users in other mature markets.
Trends in Paid Content Average Revenue per Paying User (ARPPU) 
We define ARPPU as average Paid Content revenue in a given month divided by the number of MPU for such month, averaged over each month in the given period. 
We view ARPPU to be an indicator of both the strength of engagement and Paid Content monetization on our platform. Units are in U.S. dollar. 
Engagement is a key aspect to drive our monetization. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our ARPPU has increased to $11.7, or 6.2% growth compared to December 31, 2023. The growth in ARPPU was driven primarily by our strategic effort to shift users from web to the app by continuing to improve our recommendation models. 
•
In Korea, our ARPPU for the year ended December 31, 2024, has decreased to $7.8, or 1.2% decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
•
In Japan, our ARPPU for the year ended December 31, 2024 has decreased to $22.1, or 1.7% decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, but still remained relatively comparable.
•
In Rest of World, our ARPPU for the year ended December 31, 2024 has increased to $6.6, or 21.6% growth compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by reader habituation in paying to view content.

Seasonality
Historically, while the magnitude and timing varies across regions, we experienced higher levels of user engagement and monetization in the third quarter of the calendar year primarily as a result of increased use of our platform during the global vacation and holiday schedules of our users. In addition, many advertisers allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. As we continue to diversify our sources of revenue, and in particular increase revenue from advertising, the seasonal impacts may be more pronounced in the fourth quarter in the future or different altogether. 
Components of Results of Operations 
Revenue 
Our revenue is derived from three distinct revenue streams: Paid Content, Advertising and IP Adaptations. 
Our Paid Content revenue represents revenue generated from the sale of content on our platform to users. Advertising revenue represents revenue earned for the display of advertisements on our platform, including in-stream placement within content. Our IP Adaptations revenue comprises of revenue generated from adaptations of certain content on our offerings into other media formats such as films, streaming series, games and merchandise, which may take the form of fixed licensing fees or other arrangements where we participate in the upside of such productions, or sales of merchandise. See 
Note 2. Revenue
 in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information. 
Cost of Revenue 
Cost of revenue consists of Paid Content creator revenue shared with creators, app store fees and other variable costs. Creator revenue share includes commissions payable to creators or publishers based on revenue generated from Paid Content. App store fees include platform fees payable to companies that provide users with the ability to download the mobile application through application stores and make purchases directly through such application (such as Google and Apple) and certain other payment-related costs. These expenses are lower in Korea where more people buy Coins through our website as opposed to purchases made through mobile applications. Other variable costs include, among other things, costs directly associated with our IP Adaptations business, including payroll and related personal expenses, stock-based compensation, amortization and production costs. 
Marketing 
Marketing expenses consist of expenses incurred for the promotion of our brand, costs associated with user acquisition and costs associated with loyalty marketing campaigns where we give away free Coins. Marketing expenses also include compensation costs related to sales and marketing personnel. 
General and Administrative Expenses 
General and administrative expenses consist of all our operating costs, excluding cost of revenue and marketing, and include costs related to operating and maintaining our platform, general corporate function costs, stock-based compensation expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization of non-operating assets. See 
Note 11. Stock-Based Compensation
 in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.
Interest Income 
Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on our short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which are mainly comprised of bank deposits, and interest income from loan receivables. 
Interest Expense 
Interest expense primarily consists of interest related to our outstanding debt obligations, including both short-term borrowings and long-term debt. See 
Note 9. Debt
 in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.

Impairment Losses on Goodwill 
Impairment losses on goodwill primarily consist of recognized losses resulting from our annual goodwill impairment test. See 
Note 7. Goodwill, net and Intangible Assets, net
, in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.
Income (Loss) on Equity Method Investment, Net 
Income (loss) on equity method investment, net, includes recognized income (loss) associated with our investments accounted for using the equity method. See 
Note 18. Equity Method Investments
 in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.
Other Income (Loss), Net 
Other income, net, primarily consists of gains or losses on valuation of debt and equity securities, net, income or loss on foreign currency, net, retirement benefit, net, and other non-operating income or loss, net.
Income Tax Expense 
Income tax expense primarily includes income taxes in certain federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, primarily in the U.S., Korea, Japan and Canada. Foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates from those in the U.S. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the U.S. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, use of tax credits, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws. See 
Note 12. Income Taxes
 in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information.

Revenue increased by $65.7 million, or 5.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to strong growth in Paid Content and Advertising, partially offset by our exposure to weaker foreign currencies. The increases of $20.6 million, or 14.2%, in advertising revenue, was largely driven by double-digit growth in Japan and ROW. Such increases were largely offset by the Company's exposure to weaker foreign currencies including the KRW and JPY.

The increase in stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, was largely attributable to the consummation of the IPO, at which performance obligation for vesting had been achieved.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, our management and the Board also consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, revenue on a constant currency basis, and revenue growth on a constant currency basis, ARPPU on a constant currency basis and ARPPU growth on a constant currency basis. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional useful information in evaluating our performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as they do not reflect all the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. 
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
We define EBITDA as net income(loss) before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. Starting with the third quarter of 2024, our calculation of EBITDA has been revised to adjust for interest income in addition to interest expense. In prior periods, we only adjusted for interest expense because interest income amounts were insignificant. Prior comparable periods have now been recast to conform to the current presentation. Likewise, EBITDA margin is calculated by adjusting for interest income in addition to interest expense and prior comparable periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA with further adjustments to eliminate the effects of loss on equity method investments, effect of applying the valuation method of fair value through profit or loss (“FVPL”), impairment of goodwill, non-cash stock-based compensation and certain other non-recurring costs. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors regarding our performance, as it removes the impact of certain items that are not representative of our ongoing business, such as certain non-cash charges and variable charges. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures and are not intended to be substitutes for any GAAP financial measures. They should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as consolidated net income (loss) or consolidated net income (loss) margin. 
Using EBITDA as a performance measure has material limitations as compared to consolidated net income (loss), or other financial measures as defined under GAAP, as it excludes certain recurring items, which may be meaningful to investors. EBITDA excludes interest expense and interest income; however, as we have borrowed money to finance transactions and operations, or invested available cash to generate interest income, interest expense and interest income are elements of our cost structure and can affect our ability to generate revenue and returns for our stockholders. Further, EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization; however, as we use capital and intangible assets to generate revenue, depreciation and amortization are necessary elements of our costs and ability to generate revenue. Finally, EBITDA excludes income taxes; however, as we are organized as a corporation, the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our operations. Any measure, including EBITDA, that excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization and income taxes has material limitations as compared to net income. When using EBITDA as a performance measure, management compensates for these limitations by comparing EBITDA to net loss in each period, to allow for the comparison of the performance of the underlying core operations with the overall performance of the company on a full-cost, after-tax basis.

You are also encouraged to evaluate our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and the reasons we consider these adjustments appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating these measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of these measures in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have their limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include: 
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not include the interest expense and the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 
•
Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for replacement of assets that are being depreciated or amortized; 
•
Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of charges and receipts resulting from matters we do not find indicative of our ongoing operations; and 
•
Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin differently than we do.

Use of Constant Currency
We provide revenue, including period-over-period growth rates, adjusted to remove the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations and the impact of deconsolidated and transferred operations, which we refer to as revenue on a constant currency basis. We calculate revenue on a constant currency basis in a given period by applying the average currency exchange rates in the comparable period of the prior year to the local currency revenue in the current period. We calculate revenue growth (as a percentage) on a constant currency basis by determining the increase in current period revenue over prior period revenue, where current period foreign currency revenue is translated using prior period average currency exchange rates. In addition to adjustments for foreign currency exchange fluctuations, we have also adjusted revenue to exclude the impact of deconsolidation of Jakga and LOCUS and its subsidiaries, and the transfer of SERIES ON, one of our offerings, from NAVER WEBTOON to NAVER to improve comparability between the two periods. We calculate revenue (including growth rates) on a constant currency basis in each of our revenue streams - Paid Content, Advertising and IP Adaptations - using the same method as laid out herein. See Note 17. 
Disposition and Business Combination
 in the accompanying notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information. 
We provide ARPPU, including period-over-period growth rates, on a constant currency basis for our Paid Content revenue streams as average Paid Content revenue on a constant currency basis in a given month divided by the number of MPU for such month, averaged over each month in the given period. As discussed above, we calculate revenue on a constant currency basis in a given period by applying the average currency exchange rates in the comparable period of the prior year to the local currency revenue in the current period and excluding deconsolidated and transferred operations. We calculate ARPPU growth rates (as a percentage) on a constant currency basis as the increase in current period ARPPU over prior period ARPPU, with current period foreign currency ARPPU translated using prior period average currency exchange rates and excluding deconsolidated and transferred operations. 
 We believe providing revenue, revenue growth rates, ARPPU and ARPPU growth rates on a constant currency basis helps our investors better understand our underlying performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility and impacts of deconsolidated and transferred operations that are not indicative of our actual results of operations. Adjusting revenue or ARPPU to remove the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, deconsolidation, and transfer of operations results in non-GAAP measures that management uses to help make informed decisions by removing the volatility caused by foreign currency rate fluctuations and the impact of deconsolidated and transferred operations, allowing us to assess whether the business is fundamentally healthy and growing. Additionally, these metrics support management in efficiently allocating resources and determining priorities by providing a basis for evaluating the competitiveness and growth potential of the business itself. It is for these reasons that management believes these non-GAAP metrics add value, but they have their limitations as analytical tools for not reflecting all the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
On June 28, 2024, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in which we issued and sold 15,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $21.00 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $281.7 million from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.
Also, immediately subsequent to the closing of the IPO, we issued and sold 2,380,952 shares of common stock to NAVER U.Hub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NAVER, in a private placement at $21.00 per share and received $50 million in proceeds.
64
Table of Contents
On July 26, 2024, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option to purchase 1,371,549 shares of common stock at $21.00 per share, which was closed on July 30, 2024. We received net proceeds of approximately $26.8 million therefrom, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us.
Historically, we have relied primarily upon cash generated from operations and cash provided by NAVER through capital contributions to finance our operations, repay or repurchase indebtedness, finance acquisitions and fund our capital expenditures. NAVER does not have any contractual obligation to provide additional capital to us and therefore there can be no assurance that NAVER will continue to provide additional capital in the form of debt or equity investment in the future to enable us to operate our business. As of December 31, 2024, we had $572.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, which were primarily invested in short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase and are mainly comprised of bank deposits. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to support our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months based on our current operating plans. However, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, sales and marketing activities and other factors affecting our business, including those described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report. Our expected primary uses of our capital on short-and long-term bases are for repayment of debt, interest payments, working capital, capital expenditures, geographic expansion and other general corporate purposes.
We may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products and technologies, including intellectual property rights, which may require us to seek additional financing. To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through the incurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of additional equity or a combination of these potential sources of funds. Such financing, may however, not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. In particular, high inflation and interest rates have resulted, and may continue to result, in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital. If we are unable to raise additional funds on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations—We may require additional capital to support our business in the future, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all.”

Operating Activities 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $17.9 million, which primarily consisted of a net loss of $152.9 million, adjusted for certain non-cash items of $185.6 million. The non-cash items primarily consisted of stock-based compensation of $87.4 million, impairment losses of $69.7 million, and depreciation and amortization of approximately $40.1 million, which was offset by a decrease of $24.5 million in deferred tax expenses. The net cash outflow from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments. 
Investing Activities 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $17.3 million, primarily due to payments made for short-term investments of $77.4 million, and purchases of intangible assets of $10.7 million, which was offset by proceeds received from maturities of short-term investments of approximately $68.0 million.

Financing Activities 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $353.9 million, consisting primarily of $293.0 million in proceeds from the IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, and $50.0 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock related to private placement, and $26.8 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, from the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters in connection with the IPO, which was offset by payments of IPO costs of $11.2 million
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
We believe that the following accounting policies and estimates involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies and estimates we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of our operations. See Note 1. 
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a description of our other significant accounting policies. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates. 
Revenue Recognition 
We generate revenue primarily by Paid Content, advertising and IP Adaptations. We recognize revenue when services are transferred to customers at the transaction price.
Paid Content revenue 
We recognize revenue of Paid Content when we provide users with access to content on our platform in exchange for a purchase fee. On most of our platforms, users purchase access to content by first purchasing Coins and then redeeming such Coins for access to particular content. We recognize Paid Content revenue over the estimated service period upon redemption of Coins, which we determine based on the weighted average number of days between the first day the user is provided access to the content and the last day the user views the content. We believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services. We recognize most of our Paid Content revenue on a gross basis, which means before deducting creator revenue share (commissions payable to the creator). In certain cases where we have determined that we act as an agent in such transfer of services, we recognize revenue net of the creator revenue share or other amounts remitted to the creator or publisher. 
Advertising revenue 
Advertising revenue is recognized at the point in time the advertisement is displayed or based on clicks, impressions or end-user activity. When the customer is an advertising agency, advertising revenue is comprised of the commission the Company earns for lending advertisement space to the advertising agency. 
IP Adaptations revenue 
We recognize revenue of IP Adaptations based on the terms of the contractual arrangement with our creators. In an arrangement where a creator has authority to make key creative decisions on the output, we recognize revenue over time on a percentage-of-completion basis. If we control the key creative decisions, we recognize revenue as fixed payments for the content upon delivery to and acceptance by the creator or as sales-based royalties when the sell-through sales of the content occur. Similarly, we serve as a principal and recognize revenue on a gross basis when we directly sell licensed merchandise to customers through digital storefronts while controlling the revenue stream, from inventory to distribution. When we serve as an agent through brokering licensing arrangements between creators or publishers and third-party platforms or through licensing IP to third parties that operate all aspects of the revenue stream, we recognize revenue on a net commission basis when we broker such arrangements or as net of the amounts remitted to the third-party merchant when control transfers to the customer, generally at the time of product shipment from its facilities. 
Income Taxes 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Our deferred tax assets are recorded net of valuation allowances when, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.
66
Table of Contents
Business Combinations 
From time to time, we may enter into business combinations. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. 
We describe our accounting policy for business combinations in Note 1. 
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.  
Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
In addition to intangible assets acquired individually, we have identified intangible assets and generated significant goodwill through our acquisitions. Brand, software, trademarks, copyrights and patents are amortized to cost of revenue and general and administrative expenses to operating expense on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intellectual property rights with definite lives are amortized to operating expense over their estimated economic useful lives or the period over which we have exclusive and unrestricted rights to the content under the contract. 
We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets such as membership and publishing rights for impairment annually as of October 1, or earlier if an event or other circumstance indicates that it may not recover the carrying value of the asset. If we believe that, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is not required. Reporting units are businesses for which individual financial information is available. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, a quantitative impairment test is performed. The Company may elect to bypass this qualitative assessment for annual impairment evaluations as of October 1 for some or all of its reporting units and perform a quantitative test. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill recorded for that reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment based on market and operational conditions at the time of the evaluation, including management’s best estimates of the reporting unit’s future business activity and the related estimates and assumptions of future cash flows from the assets that include the associated goodwill. 
As discussed above, there is an inherent degree of uncertainty in preparing any forecast of future results, and the key inputs require significant judgments to be made. Any significant changes in these underlying assumptions may significantly affect our impairment conclusions and net book value of our corresponding assets in our consolidated financial statements. During the fourth quarter of December 31, 2024, there was a material change in the cash flow assumptions that led to the impairment of goodwill arising from a delay in realizing synergies and returns from investments in content creation and IP Adaptations, the postponement of releases for major works, the ongoing Wattpad ban in a certain country, and the delay in web-novel video production at the Munpia, Wattpad, and Wattpad WEBTOON Studios Corp. (“Wattpad WEBTOON Studios”) reporting units, respectively, as of October 1, 2024.
As of the October 1, 2024, annual impairment testing date, four reporting units had goodwill – Munpia, Wattpad WEBTOON Studios, Wattpad, and LDF (in each case, including its subsidiaries, if any). On October 1, 2024, we performed a quantitative annual impairment test for all reporting units, which resulted in $46.7 million, $20.3 million and $2.7 million impairment of goodwill at Wattpad, Munpia, and Wattpad WEBTOON Studios reporting units, respectively. The remaining goodwill at the Wattpad, Munpia, LDF and Wattpad WEBTOON Studios reporting units following impairment were $437.2 million, $154.2 million, $71 million and $2.9 million, respectively. No goodwill impairment was recorded for the LDF reporting unit given as its fair value substantially exceeded its respective carrying value.
The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow method with significant inputs such as projected future cash flows, discount rate and terminal growth rate. Our cash flow assumptions are based on detailed, multi-year forecasts performed by each of our operating reporting units that reflect our business plans and market outlook information. The discount rates are determined based on each reporting unit’s cost of capital proportionately weighted between each type of capital (i.e., debt and equity). Terminal growth rates are based on historical industry growth patterns, the reporting unit’s sustainable growth rate, and macroeconomic factors such as GDP growth and inflation rates. The carrying values were based on each respective reporting unit’s net asset balance as of October 1, 2024, and included directly attributable assets and liabilities, including goodwill.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates. 
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
Our revenue is generated globally in multiple currencies, primarily KRW, JPY and USD. Our results of current and future operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Particularly, we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of KRW and JPY against USD, since (i) a majority of our revenue is generated within Korea and Japan, and (ii) several of our primary operating subsidiaries, including NAVER WEBTOON and LDF, are located in Korea and Japan, using their respective local currency as the functional currency. Financial statements of these non-USD-denominated businesses are translated from their local currencies into USD, using exchange rates at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities, and average exchange rates in effect during the period for revenue and expenses. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of USD affect the value of certain financial metrics with respect to these businesses in the consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currencies. For example, with a stronger USD against KRW and JPY, for the year ended December 31, 2024, our revenue was $86.9 million, or 6.0%, lower than our revenue on a constant currency basis. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Use of Constant Currency” for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of revenue on a constant currency basis.  
We have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations becomes more significant. 
Interest Rate Risk 
Our cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on hand and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase and are mainly comprised of bank deposits. As of December 31, 2024, we had $572.4 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and fair market value of our investments. However, due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe an immediate 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair value of our portfolio. We therefore do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
WEBTOON Entertainment Inc. 
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WEBTOON Entertainment Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of changes in stockholders’ equity and group equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
Basis for Opinion 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Goodwill Impairment Assessments for Certain Reporting Units
As described in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance was $665.3 million as of December 31, 2024, of which the reporting units Wattpad, Munpia and LDF comprise the significant portion. Management conducts an impairment test as of October 1 of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances result in it being more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Reporting units are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded based on the difference between the fair value and carrying amount, not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill. Management utilizes the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of reporting units. Management’s cash flow projections included significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and terminal growth rates.  
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessments of certain reporting units is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and terminal growth rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge as disclosed by management, and a material weakness existed that impacted this matter.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures  included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value of the reporting units; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow method; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and terminal growth rates. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and terminal growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumption.

Note 1. 
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization and Description of Business 
WEBTOON Entertainment Inc. (the “Parent”), together with its subsidiaries, (the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), is a majority-owned subsidiary of NAVER Corporation (“NAVER”), and a leading online and web-comic platform service company. We provide hosting services for web-comics through both web and mobile applications and offer thousands of titles with episodes that are updated on a daily basis. We offer extensive and diverse genres of content, including fantasy, romance, and science fiction, on our platform. Platform refers to the various offerings through which we engage with users across diverse geographical markets including Korea, United States, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Europe. 
Wattpad Corporation (“Wattpad”), together with its subsidiaries, is a global multi-platform entertainment company for original stories, content and advertising which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of NAVER and a sister entity of the Parent when it was acquired by NAVER on May 10, 2021. On December 1, 2022, Wattpad WEBTOON Studios Inc. (“WWS”), a newly-created and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent, entered into a purchase agreement with Wattpad pursuant to which WWS acquired Wattpad’s business related to the development of intellectual property (“IP”) into books, podcasts, movies and television productions (the “Studio Business”) for $
15.4
 million. The Studio Business consisted of 
100
% voting equity interest in Wattpad Studios Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wattpad, and certain assets and liabilities held by other subsidiaries of Wattpad. On June 1, 2023, the Parent entered into a stock contribution agreement with NAVER pursuant to which the Parent acquired 
100
% of the common shares of Wattpad in exchange for 
413,482
 shares of the common stock of the Parent (the “Wattpad Transfer”). 
The Studio Business acquisition and Wattpad Transfer were accounted for as common control transactions in a manner similar to the pooling-of-interest method. Thus, the financial statements of the commonly controlled entities were combined, retrospectively, as if the transactions had occurred as of January 1, 2022. 
On March 27, 2024, the Company’s board of directors approved a merger between Line Digital Frontier Corporation (“LDF”) and eBOOK Initiative Japan Co., Ltd. (“eBIJ”), to integrate the Company’s 
two
 wholly owned subsidiaries’ business and operations, with LDF as the surviving company (the “LDF-eBIJ Merger”). The effective date of the LDF-eBIJ Merger was September 1, 2024 and eBIJ was dissolved through an absorption-type merger under the applicable corporate laws in Japan.
Basis of Presentation 
For the period prior to December 1, 2022, the accompanying financial statements and footnotes present the combined Parent consolidated and Wattpad consolidated financial information. For the period after December 1, 2022, the Studio Business financial information is presented as part of the Parent consolidated financial information and is combined with the remaining Wattpad consolidated financial information. For the period after June 1, 2023, Wattpad is presented as part of the Company consolidated financial information. These financial statements and footnotes are therefore referred to as “Consolidated Financial Statements” throughout. NAVER’s equity interest in Wattpad during the period preceding the Wattpad Transfer is reflected within “Group Equity” within the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and Group Equity. Upon completion of the Wattpad Transfer, the Company acquired NAVER’s equity interest in Wattpad and the Group Equity is no longer applicable. 
On June 26, 2024, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amended Charter”) which effectuated a 
30
-for-1 forward stock split of its common stock and adjusted the par value of its common stock from $
0.01
 to $
0.0001
 on such date. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split and change in par value for all periods presented. In lieu of issuing fractional shares, the Company opted to pay the holder thereof an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such fractional share. The Amended Charter authorized 
2,100,000,000
 shares of capital stock, consisting of 
2,000,000,000
 shares of common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share, and 
100,000,000
 shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share. 
No
 preferred stock was issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
On June 28, 2024, the Company completed its initial public offering (the “IPO”) in which it issued and sold 
15,000,000
 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $
21.00
 per share. The Company received proceeds of approximately $
281.7
 million from the IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $
22.1
 million and offering 
F-10
Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
costs of $
11.2
 million. Additionally, the underwriters have the option, for a period of 
30
 days, to purchase up to an additional 
2,250,000
 common shares at the public offering price, less the underwriting discount and commissions to cover over-allotment. On July 26, 2024, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option to purchase 
1,371,549
 shares of common stock for proceeds of $
26.8
 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions.
Substantially concurrently with the closing of the IPO, the Company issued 
2,380,952
 shares of common stock to NAVER U.Hub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of NAVER, at the public offering price of $
21.00
 per share for aggregate proceeds of $
50.0
 million. The sale of such shares to U.Hub is not registered under the Securities Act and these shares were subject to a 
180-day
 lock-up agreement with the underwriters in connection with the offering. The underwriters did not receive any fees in connection with the sale of such shares. 
Prior to the IPO, deferred offering costs, which consist of direct incremental legal, accounting, and other fees relating to the IPO, were capitalized in Other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the IPO, all deferred offering costs were reclassified into stockholders’ equity as an offset against proceeds from the IPO. In addition, as of June 30, 2024, the Company had accrued a $
30.0
 million cash bonus that became due to the chief executive officer upon completion of the IPO. The bonus was paid out, less applicable payroll related taxes and expenses, in July 2024.
The following Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Our fiscal year ends on December 31. Dollar amounts presented in tables are shown in thousands of United States Dollars 
(in thousands of USD)
. 
Changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary are accounted for as equity transactions (investments by owners and distributions to owners acting in their capacity as owners) with no gain or loss recognized in net loss or comprehensive loss. The carrying amount of any non-controlling interest is adjusted to reflect the change in a parent’s ownership interest in the subsidiary. Any difference between the fair value of the consideration received or paid and the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted is recognized in equity attributable to the parent. All intercompany and intra-entity transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented included all the cost of doing business, including the expenses that represent services provided by NAVER to the Company and its subsidiaries. Such services under certain agreements are charged to the Company and its subsidiaries based on estimated cost allocation plus mark-up methodology, which management believes is approximating arm’s length costs. The Company believes the charges are reasonably calculated in accordance with SAB Topic 1 Q2. The amounts are billed to and paid for by the Company or its subsidiaries on a regular basis.

Change in Filer Status
Upon completion of the IPO, the Company ceased to be an “emerging growth company” (“EGC”), as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”), due to exceeding the annual gross revenue threshold. Accordingly, we may no longer take advantage of EGC-related reduced reporting requirements that delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that are otherwise applicable to public companies. As the Company has been a public company for less than twelve months and has not yet filed a Form 10-K, the Company complies with non-accelerated public company filer effective dates of adoption. The loss of EGC status did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates relate primarily to determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, acquired intangible assets and goodwill, unit price of virtual currency in revenue recognition, deferred revenue, allowance for credit losses, evaluation of contingencies, deferred tax assets net of a valuation allowance, uncertain tax positions, the fair value of stock-based awards, the fair value of debt and equity securities and the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. We based our estimates on historical experience and on various other 
F-11
Table of Contents
WEBTOON Entertainment Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

Segment Information 
The Company operates as 
one
 operating segment which is also its reportable segment. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), who assesses performance and makes resource allocations based on financial data presented on a consolidated basis. See Note 14.
 Segment and Geographic Information 
for more information related to the Company’s segment.
Foreign Currency 
The functional currency of the Parent and reporting currency for the Company is U.S. dollars. The Korean won and the Japanese yen are the functional currencies of our major operating subsidiaries. The other subsidiaries predominantly utilize their local currencies as their functional currencies. Assets and liabilities of each subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using average rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and Group Equity and in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Revenue Recognition 
The Company primarily generates revenue through its platform by providing users with access to Paid Content, and by providing advertising services on the platform. We recognize revenue when services are transferred to customers at the transaction price which considers estimated returns on promotional discounts and earned loyalty rewards. Revenue excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as value added taxes. Historical data is used to estimate returns, promotional discounts, and earned loyalty rewards using the expected value method. We include these amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur and update our estimate of transaction price as additional information becomes available. For revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price which is primarily determined based on the price charged to customers for sales on a stand-alone basis. 
Paid Content Revenue 
Paid Content revenue is recognized when the Company provides services that provide content to users through the platform. Content provided by the platform includes, but is not limited to, web-comics, movies, web-novels, and e-books. We have an obligation to upload and maintain content on the platform by contracting with creators and publishers to make the content available to our customers. On most of our offering, customers purchase access to content by first purchasing a virtual currency (such as Coins or Cookies) then redeeming such virtual currency for access to particular content. There are other offerings where content can be purchased directly with cash. For the majority of transactions, we have determined that we are the principal for services provided to users and recognize revenue gross of commissions payable to the creator or publisher. In cases where we have determined that we are an agent in the transaction, we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to the creator or publisher. The determination of whether the Company is a principal or as an agent in Paid Content revenue transactions requires significant judgment and is based on an assessment of relevant accounting guidance and the arrangements the Company has in place with creators or publishers and end users. Key considerations in this determination include the Company’s ability to control access to, monetization of, and promotion of the content, as well as its responsibility for resolution of end user inquiries and complaints and its ability to establish the price of the content on the platform. The period of time the user can view the content varies depending on the platform and the terms of the arrangement with the user. We recognize Paid Content revenue over the estimated service period, which we determine based on the weighted average number of days between the first day the user can access the content and last day the user views the content, which varies by platform and is typically within one week. We believe this provides a reasonable depiction of the transfer of services. 
Paid Content revenue also includes the sale of physical books from other publishers. The Company earns commissions on the sales of books to end users from merchants that sell their products through the Company’s offerings. For the majority of these transactions, the Company is not the seller of record, nor does it take control of the related 
F-12
Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
inventory, which has led the Company to determine that it is an agent in these transactions. Accordingly, although the Company processes and collects the full payment on these transactions, it records revenue net of amounts remitted to the third party merchant when control transfers to the customer, generally at the time of product shipment from its facilities. 
Advertising Revenue 
We post advertisements on our websites and mobile applications and recognize revenue for advertising services. Advertising revenue is recognized at the point in time the advertisement is displayed or based on clicks, impressions, or end-user activity, which represents the point in time that control is transferred to the customer thereby completing our performance obligation. When the customer is an advertising agency, advertising revenue is comprised of the commission the Company earns for lending advertisement space to the advertising agency. 
IP Adaptations 
We internally develop IP Adaptations for films, streaming series, or other rich media format adaptations, the majority of which are commissioned for production by third party studios or streaming platforms. IP Adaptations revenue is recognized based on the terms of the contract with the customer and the determination of the Company’s performance obligation is dependent on which party has authority to make key creative decisions on the produced content. For IP Adaptations where the content is made to an individual customer specification such that the customer controls the output during the production process, the Company’s performance obligation is production services. Revenue and the associated costs of such contracts are recognized over time on a percentage of completion basis. For IP Adaptations where the Company controls the key creative decisions and output of the production process, its performance obligation is the sale of content to third-party studios and video-streaming platforms. Fixed payments for the content are recognized as revenue on a gross basis upon delivery and acceptance of the content or as sales-based royalties when sell-through sales of the content occur. IP Adaptations revenue also includes license fees generated from sub-licensing content to third parties for secondary media such as video game production. Content sub-licensing revenue is recognized when the Company brokers licensing arrangements between creators or publishers and other third-party platforms on a net commission basis as the Company is acting as an agent in these transactions. 
IP Adaptations also include the sale of licensed merchandise under two types of arrangements. In one type of arrangement the Company acts as a principal in the sale of licensed merchandise, while in the other, the Company serves as an agent. 
In Korea, the Company directly sells licensed merchandise to customers through digital storefronts, including the related-party NAVER platform and other e-commerce websites. The merchandise is manufactured by third parties in small batches to meet estimated demand or fulfill preorders. As the seller of record, the Company takes control of the relevant inventory prior to distribution, sets the merchandise price, and manages any after-sale issues including refund claims. Thus, the Company is considered a principal in this type of arrangement and recognizes revenues on a gross basis. 
In other countries, the Company generates merchandise revenues by licensing IP to third parties who operate all aspects of the revenue stream, from manufacturing the products to maintaining the online merchandise store which operates under the WEBTOON brand. Licensing fees are determined by the contractual commission rate or fixed fee applied to the underlying sales of merchandise. In this type of arrangement, the Company is considered an agent as it is not the seller of record, nor does it take control of the related inventory. Accordingly, although the Company processes and collects the full payments on these transactions, the Company recognizes revenues net of the amounts remitted to the third-party merchant when control transfers to the customer, generally at the time of product shipment from its facilities.

Cost of Revenue 
Cost of revenue primarily consists of the commission fees payable to content rights holders as well as other costs directly associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content, such as payroll and related personnel expenses, amortization and production related costs. Cost of revenue also includes fees charged by payment gateway companies for processing payments on the offerings as well as platform fees payable to companies that provide consumers with the ability to download the mobile app through app stores (such as Google and Apple) or to third parties providing a platform hosting service.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Marketing 
Marketing expenses primarily consist of online and offline advertising and marketing program costs. Marketing expenses also include market research and public relations related expenses that support marketing activities.
 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and total advertising expenses were $
36.6
 million, $
28.3
 million and $
70.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022,  respectively. 
General and Administrative Expenses 
General and administrative expenses include all our operating costs, excluding cost of revenue and marketing, as described above. More specifically, these expenses include costs related to operating and maintenance of our platform, general corporate function costs, and depreciation and amortization of non-operating assets.

Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with U.S. GAAP which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. The Company determines the fair value of equity-based awards granted on the grant date using appropriate valuation techniques. Forfeitures are estimated using historical experience at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimate. See Note 11. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
for more information on the Company’s stock compensation plans. 
Stock-Based Awards Issued to Employees of NAVER
The Company issues stock-based awards to employees of NAVER that do not render services to the Company. The Company measures the award based on the grant-date fair value and accounts for the awards as a dividend distribution to NAVER following the attribution principles of ASC 718.
Defined severance benefits 
We accrue severance benefits for employees of our Korean subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Employee Retirement Benefit Security Act of Korea, eligible employees with one or more years of service are entitled to severance payments upon the termination of their employment based on their length of service and pay rate. We recognize the defined severance benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding adjustment to Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The obligations are measured annually, or more frequently if there is a remeasurement event, based on our measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the discount rates, salary growth rates, and certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality. We review our actuarial assumptions and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. We have adopted a policy of immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses where any differences arising from the annual remeasurement is immediately charged in the period of the remeasurement within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as Other income (loss), net.

Income Taxes 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Our deferred tax assets are recorded net of valuation allowances when, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. The consolidated financial statements reflect the jurisdictional netting of deferred tax assets and liabilities within each tax jurisdiction. However, the tax footnote disclosures are presented on a gross basis, without netting across jurisdictions, to provide a detailed breakdown of deferred tax balances as required by the applicable accounting standards. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income. In considering the need for a valuation allowance, we consider our historical, as well as future projected taxable income, along with other positive and negative evidence in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Decreases to 
F-14
Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
valuation allowances are recorded as reductions to our income tax expense and increases to valuation allowances result in additional expense for income taxes. We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return utilizing a two-step process. In the first step, recognition, we determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not criteria. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of greater than 50 percent of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 
The Company does not record a deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis difference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the Company has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings on the foreign subsidiaries indefinitely. The management’s intention is to invest the undistributed earnings on the foreign subsidiaries indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account various items, including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase and are mainly comprised of bank deposits
. 
Receivables, net of allowance for credit losses
Receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, are stated at their carrying value, net of allowance for credit losses based on lifetime expected losses. Receivable balances are primarily receivables due from payment gateway providers relating to sales processed for the Company’s online platform service business, as well as receivables from advertising activities, net of estimated allowances for credit losses. The Company estimates the allowance for credit losses based upon historical experience, the age and delinquency rates of receivables and the credit quality of the customers, as well as economic and regulatory conditions combined with reasonable and supportable management forecasts of collectibility and other economic factors over the lifetime of the receivables. The Company writes off accounts against the allowance for credit losses when they are deemed to be uncollectible. The total allowances for credit losses as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were $
3.4
 million and $
1.1
 million, respectively. Credit loss expense is included in General and administrative expenses.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts reported for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.
Property and Equipment, net 
Property and equipment, net is stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment primarily include buildings, land, leasehold improvements, and information technology equipment. Depreciation expense is classified within General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

Leases 
We determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. Leases with contractual terms greater than twelve months are classified as either operating or finance leases. Operating leases are recorded as operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all classes of assets and elected to not record leases with an initial term of twelve months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments over the lease term. When the Company has the option to extend the term or terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, and it is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option, the Company considers these options in determining the lease term. The Company’s operating

leases are comprised of leases of real estate and equipment that are typically entered into for a fixed term that may contain extension and termination options. Certain agreements have free rent periods or escalating rent payment provisions. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Company subleases its properties, which are all classified as operating leases. Any sub-leasing revenue is classified as Other income (loss), net. The Company does not have any finance leases. See Note 8.

 for further information.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets 
Long-lived assets include property and equipment, trademarks, copyrights, patents, software, brand and other intangible assets with finite lives. Long-lived assets are not required to be tested for impairment annually, but rather whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Conditions that may necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may indicate potential impairment. When the undiscounted future cash flows indicate the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable, any potential impairment loss is measured and recognized at the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.

See Note 6. 
Property and Equipment, net
 and Note 7. 
Goodwill, net and Intangible Assets, net
 for impairments recognized in the year ended December 31, 2024,  December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 
Deferred Offering Costs 
Deferred offering costs, consisting of legal, accounting advisory, and other fees and costs relating to the Company’s planned initial public offering are capitalized within Other current assets, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the year ended December 31, 2023. Upon the closing of the initial public offering, the deferred offering costs in the amount of $
11.2
 million were offset against the proceeds received by the Company.

Change in Estimated Useful Lives of Intangible Assets 
The Company conducts an annual review, at a minimum, of the estimated useful lives of its finite-lived intangible assets. This review indicates that the actual lives of certain intangible assets were shorter than the estimated useful lives over which such assets are amortized due to the abandonment of certain intangible assets that cease to be used.
 As a result, the Company recognized accelerated amortization expense for these intangible assets of $
3.9
 million, $
2.5
 million and $
1.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024,  December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. 
Fair Value Measurements 
Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Additionally, receivables, term deposits, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: 
Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 
Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. 
We measure the fair value of certain equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other debt and equity securities are valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Fair Value Option 
The Company elects to account for debt securities under the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments, (“ASC 825”). Under the fair value option, these debt securities are recognized at fair value at inception and change in fair value at each subsequent reporting date is recognized as a component of Other income (loss), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
Equity Securities without Readily Determinable Fair Value 
For equity securities without readily determinable fair value, securities are recorded at cost less impairment, and adjusted for subsequent observable price changes as of the date that an observable transaction takes place. The Company performs a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis to determine if any observable price changes have occurred. If the qualitative assessment indicates that an observable price change has occurred for the same or similar security of the issuer, a gain or loss is recorded equal to the difference between the fair value and carrying value in the current period as a component of Other income (loss), net. 
Loans 
Typically, loans that do not meet the definition of a debt security, are stated at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses. We write off loans against the allowance for credit losses when they are deemed to be uncollectible. Refer to 
Receivables, net of allowance for credit losses
 in Note 1. 
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 for additional information on estimated credit losses for loan receivables.
Accrued interest receivable on loans is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other current assets, net. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest receivable was $
0.7
 million and $
1.4
 million, respectively. 
Equity Method Investments 
We apply the equity method to account for investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. There is a rebuttable presumption that an investor has significant influence when it owns more than 20% of the common stock of a corporation and more than 3% partnership interest in a partnership. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock. We record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. Basis differences between the cost of an equity method investment and the underlying equity in the intangible assets are amortized over the estimated economic useful life of the underlying intangible asset. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. If net losses reduce our carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may reduce other investments in the same investee, if they exist. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value. 
Equity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company may estimate the fair value of its equity method investments by considering recent investee equity transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, recent operating results, comparable public company operating cash flow multiples and, in certain situations, balance sheet liquidation values. If the fair value of the investment has dropped below its carrying amount, management considers several factors when determining whether an other-than-temporary decline has occurred, such as the length of the time and the extent to which the estimated fair value or market value has been below the carrying value, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the investee, the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the investee for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, and general market conditions. The estimation of fair value and whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred requires the application of significant judgment and future results may vary from current assumptions. If declines in the value of the equity method investments are determined to be other-than-temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period as a component of Loss on equity method investment, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

Concentrations of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, term deposits, receivables and loan receivables. We maintain cash deposits, cash equivalent balances with several financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents may be withdrawn or redeemed on demand. We believe that these financial institutions that hold our cash, cash equivalents and term deposits are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these balances. We extend credit to our customers, payment gateway companies and borrowers based on an evaluation of their ability to pay amounts due under contractual arrangement and generally do not obtain or require collateral.
Cash and cash equivalents, receivables and loan receivables are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents are placed with several financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality.
 The Company’s receivables include amounts concentrated with three payment gateway companies representing 
54.9
% and 
49.6
% of the total receivables balance as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Three borrowers represent 
89.0
% and 
96.6
% of the total loan receivables balance as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
There are no individual customers who account for more than 10% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, or 10% or more of its receivables balance as of December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
Business Combinations 
We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire from the date of acquisition. We determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the respective date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. As a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill. At the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. When we issue payments or grants of equity to selling stockholders in connection with an acquisition, we evaluate whether the payments or awards are compensatory. This evaluation includes whether cash payments or stock award vesting is contingent on the continued employment of the selling stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for the cash to be paid or stock awards to vest, the award is treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and is recognized as compensation expense. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in General and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

Variable Interest Entity 
We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (“VIE”). We consolidate a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary (see Note 16. Related Parties and Variable Interest Entity). We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. 
Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.

Common Control Transactions 
Assets and liabilities transferred in common control transactions are recognized at the historical cost of the ultimate parent of the entities under common control. In determining the receiving entity in common control transactions, the entity that first came under control of the ultimate parent is presented as the accounting receiving entity regardless of the legal form of the transaction. Any difference in the amount paid by the receiving entity versus the assets and liabilities transferred at the historical cost of the ultimate parent to the receiving entity is recorded as an adjustment to equity. Business combinations between entities under common control that result in a change in reporting entity are accounted for retrospectively for all periods presented as if the combination had been in effect since the inception of common control. Assets acquisitions between entities under common control are accounted for prospectively. When performing goodwill impairment testing during the period when common control transactions are retrospectively presented, we use the historical reporting unit structures of each of the respective common control entities. The reporting units are reassessed for goodwill impairment testing purposes at the time of the common control transaction to the extent any changes are made to the reporting units as a result of such common control transaction.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets such as membership and intellectual property rights for impairment annually as of October 1, or earlier if an event or other circumstance indicates that it may not recover the carrying value of the asset. If the Company believes that, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is not required.
Reporting units are businesses for which individual financial information is available. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, a quantitative impairment test is performed. The Company may elect to bypass this qualitative assessment for annual impairment evaluations as of October 1 for some or all of its reporting units and perform a quantitative test. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill recorded for that reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment based on market and operational conditions at the time of the evaluation, including management’s best estimates of the reporting unit’s future business activity and the related estimates and assumptions of future cash flows from the assets that include the associated goodwill. 
In determining the fair value of the reporting units, management considers both the income approach and the market approach. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model (income valuation approach) based on projections of future years’ operating results and associated cash flows combined with comparable trading and transaction multiples based on guideline public companies. The calculated estimated fair value of the reporting unit reflects a number of significant management assumptions and estimates including the forecast of revenue growth, terminal growth rates, and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value. 
The Company’s projections incorporate management’s best estimates of the expected future results, which include expectations related to new and retained business and future operating margins. Projected future cash flows are then discounted to present value using a discount rate management believes is commensurate with the risks inherent in the cash flows.
Basic and Diluted Losses per Share 
The share numbers are retroactively stated for purposes of calculating weighted average number of shares outstanding for loss per share to reflect the outstanding shares of Wattpad as if the equity structure of the Parent (the accounting acquirer) was stated to reflect the number of shares of Wattpad (the accounting acquiree) issued in the common control transactions. Basic loss per share available to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. The dilutive loss per share impact of the subsidiaries is included in our numerator when calculating loss per share.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Each reporting period, a measurement period adjustment is recorded to adjust the redeemable non-controlling interest to its maximum redemption amount with changes recorded in retained earnings (or Additional paid-in capital if the Company has an accumulated deficit) if such non-controlling interest is probable of being redeemed. Changes to redemption value will be reflected as a corresponding adjustment to the numerator for earnings (loss) per share. As of December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, no adjustments were made to redemption value or loss per share as the redeemable non-controlling interest was not probable of being redeemed.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted 
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, Leases (Topic 842), Common Control Arrangements, which clarifies the accounting for leasehold improvements associated with common control leases. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU 2023-01 became effective for us on January 1, 2024. The adoption of ASU 2023-01 did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which amends Topic 280 primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2023-07 become effective for us on January 1, 2024, for fiscal years and January 1, 2025, for interim periods on a retrospective basis for all periods presented in the financial statements. We do not believe the impact of the new guidance and related codification improvements had a material impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Yet to Be Adopted
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. ASU 2023-06 includes a number of amendments to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of topics in order to allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to the requirements and to align the requirements in the FASB accounting standard codification with the SEC’s regulations. The effective date for each amendment will be 2 years after the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires enhancements and further transparency to certain income tax disclosures, most notably the tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, on a prospective basis and retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting pronouncement on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In March 2024, the SEC adopted new rules that will require disclosures about climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on registrants’ business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. The required information about climate-related risks will also include disclosure of a registrant’s greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the rules will require registrants to present certain climate-related financial metrics in their audited financial statements. On April 4, 2024, the SEC determined to voluntarily stay the final rules pending certain legal challenges. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of these rules on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. 
In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-03, Income Statement (Topic 220): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires additional disclosures of certain amounts included in the expense captions presented on the Statement of Operations as well as disclosures about selling expenses. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis, with the option for retrospective application, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of adopting this guidance on its financial statement disclosures.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 the weighted-average number of shares used in the calculation reflects the outstanding shares of Wattpad as if the equity structure of the Parent (the accounting acquirer) was retroactively stated to reflect the number of shares issued in the Wattpad Transfer. 
Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of the RSUs. For the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Company’s Korean subsidiaries each had outstanding stock options that will be settled in each respective subsidiary’s common shares. The numerator of the Company’s loss per share includes the Parent’s proportionate share of the diluted earnings (loss) per share impact of outstanding subsidiaries’ stock options.

On October 1, 2023, the Company approved a plan to sell a building and land held by Jakga Company Inc. (“Jakga”), a Korean subsidiary. Jakga initially acquired the land and building for office use, but Jakga later decided against utilizing the property for this purpose, leading to their sale. The building and land were considered a single disposal group as they were intended to be sold in a single transaction. Upon approval of the plan, the building and land were classified as held for sale and measured at the lower of their aggregate carrying value or estimated aggregate fair value, less costs to sell. The Company recognized 
no
 write-down loss during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
No
 depreciation expense was recorded for the assets held for sale starting October 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. The Company deconsolidated Jakga on March 28, 2024, and therefore was excluded from the scope of consolidation. Jakga completed the sale during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Advance payments are primarily comprised of the payment of minimum guarantees to creators or publishers for their provision of content, such as web-comics, on the Company’s platform. 
The advance payments for production of film contents are directly related to the contract that will be used to satisfy a future performance obligation and are expected to be recovered. The Company’s balance of advance payments due to film production contracts are $
35.1
 million and $
24.7
 million, as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. These costs are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of services to the customer to which the asset relates. The Company recorded amortization of $
11.5
 million, $
8.0
 million ,and $
27.0
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 respectively.
The advance payments for minimum guarantee are amortized as the associated commission expenses payable to creators or publishers are incurred. When the Company determines the estimated future commission expenses payable are less than the carrying amount of such advance payments, the remaining portion of that advance payment is charged to expense in the period in which such determination is made. The Company charged advance payments to expense due to such determination in the amounts of $
0.2
 million, $
1.2
 million, and $
0.4
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 respectively. 
Other current assets, net, consist primarily of inventories, the current portion of leasehold deposits and contract asset. The allowances on short-term loans were 
immaterial
 to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
Term deposits are bank deposits held by Korean and Japanese subsidiaries of the Company with maturities of less than one year but more than three months. As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the term deposit balance of $
8.0
 million and $
7.1
 million was pledged to Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation as a compensating balance deposit on contract liabilities of the Company’s subsidiary in accordance with the

Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are initially recognized at cost and stated net of accumulated amortization. The amortization expense is recorded in General and administrative expenses or Cost of revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, depending upon the nature of activities. Brands, software, trademarks, copyrights and patents are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intellectual property rights consist of exclusive rights under contracts, customer relationships, and publishing rights. Intellectual property rights with definite lives are amortized over their economic useful lives or the period over which we have exclusive and unrestricted rights to the content under the contract on a straight-line basis, while intellectual property rights with perpetual exclusive rights are treated as indefinite-lived assets. 
Amortization expense for intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, was $
36.7
 million, $
34.5

(*)
Accumulated impairment losses include $
101.4
 million and $
63.4
 million of impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Additionally, cumulative translation adjustments (“CTA”) resulted in a net reversal of $
5.0
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, whereas a net charge of $
0.7
 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023.

During 2024, the Company deconsolidated its reporting unit Jakga, which resulted in the Company derecognizing goodwill, net in the amount of $
13.6
 million, which consisted of goodwill of $
44.3
 million and accumulated impairment of $
30.7
 million. During 2023, the Company deconsolidated LOCUS which resulted in the Company derecognizing goodwill related to the reporting unit of $
30.3
 million (see Note 17. 
Disposition and Business Combinations
).  The Company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company elected to bypass a qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative assessment to fulfill its annual goodwill impairment testing requirements under U.S. GAAP. The fair value of each reporting unit as of October 1, 2024, and October 1, 2023, respectively, was estimated using a discounted cash flow method with significant Level 3 inputs such as projected future cash flows, discount rate and terminal growth rate. The carrying values were based on each respective reporting unit’s net asset balance as of October 1, 2024, and October 1, 2023, respectively, and included directly attributable assets and liabilities, including goodwill. 
The company recognized impairment loss on goodwill for Wattpad, Munpia, and WWS of $
46.7
 million, $
20.3
 million, and $
2.7
 million respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as the carrying value of each reporting unit exceeded 
F-27
Table of Contents
WEBTOON Entertainment Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
the fair value of the respective reporting unit. For Wattpad, strategic shifts toward an ad-based revenue model has not yet yielded significant revenue improvement, resulting in delayed profitability enhancement which contributed to the impairment of the reporting unit. For Munpia, structural changes in operations, workforce reduction, and project delays resulted in the underperformance in revenue growth which contributed to the impairment of the reporting unit. In the case of WWS, lower than expected operating profits and cash flows contributed to the impairment of the reporting unit.
The Company recognized impairment loss on goodwill for WWS, Munpia, and Jakga of $
6.1
 million, $
25.6
 million, and $
31.7
 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as the carrying value of each reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the respective reporting unit. For WWS, the delay in web-novel video production resulted in lower operating profits and cash flows than expected, leading to the impairment of the reporting unit. As for Munpia, operating profits and cash flows were lower than anticipated due to a delay in realizing synergies and returns from investments in content creation and IP Adaptations which were initiated as a vertical expansion from Munpia’s platform business, leading to the impairment of the reporting unit. In the case of Jakga, the postponement of releases for major works led to operating profits and cash flows that were lower than anticipated, leading to the impairment of the reporting unit. 
Making estimates requires significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements could change in the near term due to one or more future events. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of the reporting units, potentially resulting in a non-cash impairment charge. 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized 
no
 goodwill impairment.

Note 8. 
Leases 
The Company engages in leasing arrangements that primarily involve office buildings, some of which are further subleased to third parties or related parties. The Company has not entered into any arrangements that include residual value guarantees for its leases. The Company has extension options for 
two
 lease offices, with extension periods of 
five years
 and 
one year
, respectively; however, since the likelihood of extension is not reasonably certain, it is not reflected in the right-of-use assets and liabilities.

Note 10. 
Commitments and Contingencies
Contingencies 
The Company records a loss contingency, consistent with ASC 450, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses material contingencies when it believes a loss is not probable but reasonably possible. Accounting for contingencies requires us to use judgement related to both the likelihood of a loss and the estimate of the amount or range of loss. 
Legal Proceedings 
The Company is involved in a number of claims pending with various courts, or otherwise unresolved as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Adverse results in these claims may include awards of damages and may also result in, or even compel a change in the Company’s business practices, which could materially impact the Company’s

future financial results. The Company cannot determine the potential loss or a range of possible losses for cases in their initial stages or where there is an unclear and inconsistent interpretation of laws related to the industry-specific grievances across various jurisdictions. Though the outcome of pending lawsuits and claims cannot be anticipated with certainty, the Company does not expect adverse results from its pending lawsuits and claims, as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The timing and outcome of ongoing legal proceedings are uncertain by nature. Therefore, while management deems the chance of a significant loss for all pending claims, whether asserted or unasserted, to be remote, the resolution of one or more of these legal matters against the Company during the same reporting period in excess of management’s projections could negatively impact the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for that reporting period. 
Securities Litigation 
On September 5, 2024, a purported stockholder filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company, its directors, and the underwriters of the IPO in the federal court for the Central District of California, purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant or traceable to the IPO Prospectus and the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-279863) relating to the IPO (the “Registration Statement”). The complaint alleges that the Registration Statement was materially false and misleading in violation of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933. On October 10, 2024, the court ordered that the defendants are not required to answer or otherwise respond to the complaint, deferring any response until after the court rules on any motion by a purported class member to serve as lead plaintiff. On December 12, 2024, the court appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. On February 3, 2025, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint, and on March 4, 2025, the Company, its directors, and the underwriters of the IPO moved to dismiss the amended complaint. The Company intends to defend this case vigorously. At this early state of the proceedings, the Company can neither predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation nor estimate any range of possible losses. 
On November 15, 2024, a purported stockholder filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit against the Company’s directors, naming the Company as a nominal defendant, in the federal court for the Central District of California. The complaint focuses on the same allegations as the putative securities class action described above, including that the Company’s Registration Statement was materially false or misleading. The complaint includes claims for violations of Section 14 (a) of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duties, and unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and contribution under Section 11(f) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the Section 31D of the Exchange Act of 1934. On January 13, 2025, by stipulation of the parties, the court ordered the shareholder derivative lawsuit stayed pending resolution of the Company’s motion to dismiss in the putative securities class action. At this early state of the proceedings, the Company can neither predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation nor estimate any range of possible losses.

Stock-Based Compensation
2020 Equity Incentive Plan 
In November 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved and adopted the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”) that was amended and restated in December 2021 (“First Amendment”), February 2023 (“Second Amendment”) and in November 2023 (“Third Amendment”). The 2020 Plan governs the terms for the granting of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options and RSUs, to employees, consultants, and directors of the Company. The Company granted stock options that vest upon the satisfaction of both service-based and performance-based conditions and stock options that vest upon satisfaction of a service-based condition. In addition, the Company granted RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of both service-based and performance-based conditions, RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of either a service-based condition or a performance-based condition and RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of a service-based condition. For the stock options and RSUs with the performance conditions satisfied upon the completion of the Company’s IPO, the Company recorded $
48.6
 million in stock-based compensation expense, consisting primarily of a cumulative catch-up adjustment related to such awards based on the full or partial fulfillment of requisite service periods. Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to these awards will be recorded over the remaining requisite service period. Under the 2020 Plan, 
7,639,440
 shares of the Company’s common stock reflecting 2024 stock split effect were initially reserved for grant. Options and RSUs under the 2020 Plan that expire or are forfeited, canceled, exchanged or repurchased are returned to the pool of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2020 Plan. The maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock issuable under the 2020 Plan is 
19,288,192
 shares. As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had 
5,277,764
 shares and 
5,033,250
 shares of common stock available for future issuance, respectively.

2024 Omnibus Incentive Plan 
In June 2024, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the stockholders approved, the 2024 Omnibus Incentive Plan ("2024 Plan"), which became effective on June 14, 2024. The Company initially reserved 
10,950,515
 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2024 Plan. Under the 2024 Plan, the number of common shares reserved will be increased by 
5
% or any such smaller number of shares as determined by the board of directors beginning on January 1, 2025 through January 1, 2034. Shares of the Company’s common stock subject to an award under the 2024 Plan shall again be made available for issuance or delivery under the 2024 Plan if such shares are (i) shares delivered, withheld or surrendered in payment of the exercise or purchase price of an award, (ii) shares delivered, withheld, or surrendered to satisfy any tax withholding obligation or (iii) shares subject to a stock-settled award that expires or is canceled, forfeited or  terminated without issuance of the full number of shares to which the award related. The 2024 Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents, other share-based awards, other cash-based awards, substitute awards, and performance awards to employees, consultants, executives, and directors.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
10,818,583
 shares of common stock available for future issuance, under the 2024 Plan.
Stock options  
The Company’s stock options are granted with exercise prices equal to the estimated fair value of common stock at the date of grant. For stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of both service and performance-based vesting conditions with cliff vesting at the end of the requisite service period (all of which were granted prior to the completion of the Company’s IPO), the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period when the performance condition is deemed probable or met. Such pre-IPO options vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to the recipient remaining an employee of the Company and the performance-based condition was satisfied upon the completion of the Company's IPO. Options with only a service-based condition generally vest quarterly over 
three years
 from the vesting start date, subject to the recipient remaining an employee of the Company at each vesting date. Stock options issued under the 2020 Plan expire 
eight years
 from the grant date. As of December 31, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options was $
12.39
 million and is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average service period of 
1.62
 years using the straight-line method, net of estimated forfeitures.

All stock options were granted prior to the completion of the Company’s IPO. As the Company was privately held prior to its IPO and did not have trading history for the Company’s common stock, the expected price volatility for the Company’s common stock was estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers that also served as benchmark references in the Company’s common stock valuations.  The expected term is the midpoint between the end of the requisite service period and the contractual term of the award. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. The Company utilized a dividend yield of 
zero
, as it had no history or plan of declaring dividends on its common stock.
Restricted Stock Units 
The Company granted (i)under the 2020 Plan RSUs with both a service- and performance-based condition, RSUs that vest upon satisfaction of  a service-based condition or a performance-based condition, and RSUs that vest upon a service-based condition and (ii) under the 2024 Plan, RSUs that vest upon  a service-based condition. RSUs generally time-vest over 
one
 to 
four years
 from the vesting start date, subject to the recipient remaining an employee of the Company at each vesting date. For RSUs subject to a performance-based condition, the performance condition was satisfied upon the completion of the Company's IPO. The RSUs carry dividend-equivalent rights during the vesting period which is accrued over the vesting period if the Company declares any dividends. Dividend equivalents are subject to the same vesting conditions applicable to the underlying RSUs and the dividend-equivalent rights are forfeited in the event the recipient is no longer an employee on the vesting date. The accrued dividend is paid upon vesting of the RSUs. As of December 31, 2024, no dividends were declared.
As of December 31, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $
28.8
 million and is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average service period of 
2.45
 years using the straight-line method and graded-vesting methods, as appropriate, net of estimated forfeitures. The total fair value of RSUs vested during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company’s effective tax rate is (
2.41
%) for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company’s current tax expenses are primarily attributable to the taxable income generated by the Parent and its Korean and Japanese subsidiaries, WTEK, Studio N, Munpia, Studio Lico, and LDF. The current income tax expense incurred by the Parent is primarily due to the limitation of foreign tax credit utilization for the year ended December 31, 2024. Other current income tax expenses incurred by Korean and Japanese subsidiaries are primarily due to taxable profits incurred as well as $
8.0
 million of foreign withholding taxes paid by WTEK in Japan. The Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets for the majority of its subsidiaries, which contributed to the negative effective tax rate. A full valuation allowance is maintained against deferred tax assets for the Parent where the majority of deferred tax benefits from its foreign tax credits are not recognized.
The effective date of the LDF-eBIJ merger was September 1, 2024. eBIJ, a profit-making entity, had net deferred tax liabilities at the date of merger, which resulted in LDF partially releasing its valuation allowance. A $
17.0
 million deferred tax benefit is primarily attributable to the release of valuation allowance related to the LDF-eBIJ merger.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.00% due to the tax benefits not recognized as a result of a full valuation allowance established by the Company and most of its foreign subsidiaries. 
The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 is (
9.04
%) which differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.00% due to the tax benefits not recognized as a result of a full valuation allowance established by the Company and most of its foreign subsidiaries. 
The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 is (
12.16
%) which differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.00% due to the tax benefits not recognized as a result of a full valuation allowance established by the Company and most of its foreign subsidiaries.

Wattpad reported a capital gain in its Canadian tax return for the year ended December 31, 2022, from the sale of its studio business to WWS. The capital gain is only 50% taxable for Canadian tax purposes. As such, 50% of capital gain was deductible as a permanent difference.
2.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, a permanent difference of $(
16.8
) million, $(
14.0
) million and $
1.5
 million, respectively, were included as branch (loss)/income. The branch loss of $
16.8
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, represents the tax effect on $
20.7
 million of accounting income and $
21.2
 million of foreign tax credits generated by WTEK. The branch loss of $
14.0
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, represents the tax effect on $
4.6
 million of accounting loss and $
13.0
 million of foreign tax credits generated by WTEK. The branch income of $
1.5
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, represents the tax effect on $
73.3
 million of accounting income and $
13.9
 million of foreign tax credits generated by WTEK. The foreign tax credits include income taxes paid in Korea and withholding taxes paid in various countries by WTEK, which are adjusted for the effect of changes in foreign tax credits in connection with the future reversal of the deferred taxes recorded under the Korean tax laws.

Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 162(m) limits the deductible compensation paid to covered employees of publicly traded companies, which includes the CEO and CFO, to $1 million per covered employee per year. The Company has disallowed total cash and equity compensation of $
74.7
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.

IRC Section 59A levies a tax on certain qualifying large corporations that have deductions with respect to amounts paid or accrued to foreign related parties that are 3% or more of their total deductions (“base erosion percentage”). A taxpayer may elect to waive such deductions to reduce their base erosion percentage below the 3% threshold. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company has waived approximately $
49.0
 million of deductions.
5.
IRC Section 951A requires a U.S. taxpayer to include income from its Controlled Foreign Corporations (“CFCs”) as Global Intangible Low Tax Income (“GILTI”) in computing U.S. taxable income. The section allows for a special deduction up to 50% of the income inclusion. The Company has GILTI inclusion of $
18.6
 million net of deductions for the year ended December 31, 2024.
6.
The Company recognized impairment loss on goodwill for Wattpad, Munpia, and WWS of $
46.7
 million, $
20.3
 million, and $
2.7
 million respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company recognized impairment loss on goodwill for WWS, Munpia, and Jakga of $
6.1
 million, $
25.6
 million, and $
31.7
 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023. The impairment loss was recognized as the carrying value of each reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the respective reporting unit. 
None
 of the goodwill generated from business combinations structured as a sale/purchase of stock was tax deductible and thus, the impairment of goodwill for book purpose for Wattpad, WWS, Munpia, and Jakga has been added back as permanent difference.
7.
On June 27, 2023, the Company sold part of its voting interest in LOCUS, decreasing its ownership to 
39.2
%. This resulted in the deconsolidation of LOCUS and its subsidiaries. $
5.4
 million of net DTA of LOCUS was removed upon deconsolidation. Since LOCUS had recorded a full valuation allowance, there was a change in the valuation allowance of $(
5.4
) million upon deconsolidation and 
no
 tax expense or benefit was recognized upon deconsolidation.
8.
WTEK has received royalty income from various foreign entities and has paid withholding taxes on such income.
9.
On December 11, 2024, the US Treasury and IRS released final regulations under IRC Section 987 and related rules, which are effective on December 10, 2024, and generally apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. For the year-ended December 31, 2024, WTEK is the only Section 987 qualified business unit (“QBU”) of the Company whose functional currency is non-USD. The Company has calculated pre-transition loss of $
63.1
 million based on the rules prescribed in the final regulations.
10.
In December 2022, the Korean National Tax Service (“KNTS”) initiated a regular tax audit for WTEK covering tax years 2020 and 2021. The tax assessment primarily relates to the disallowance of losses on a disposition of the Parent’s shares in 2020. The assessment also includes a deemed distribution from a disproportionate capital increase of its investment in an affiliate and the disallowance of research and development credits. WTEK did not appeal the assessment result and settled the tax payment in May 2023.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
As of December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $
125.6
 million, $
131.5
 million and $
105.3
 million, respectively, on its deferred tax assets related to temporary differences, taxation on foreign currency translation gains or losses, NOL carry-forwards and foreign tax credits. The changes to existing valuation allowances for the year ended December 31, 2024 were primarily attributable to the release of valuation allowance due to the LDF-eBIJ merger. 
The changes to existing valuation allowances for the year ended December 31, 2023 were primarily attributable the increase in outside basis differences of investments at the Company level and NOLs incurred by the Canadian and Japanese subsidiaries for which the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance and a valuation allowance release of $
5.4
 million from the deconsolidation of LOCUS.
The changes to existing valuation allowances for the year ended December 31, 2022 were primarily attributable to the increased foreign tax credit at the Company level and NOLs incurred by the Canadian and Japanese subsidiaries for which the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance and a valuation allowance release of $
1.1
 million from the Company’s subsidiary in Korea, Studio N, since it was determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets at these subsidiaries will be realizable based on the current prospects of their future taxable income. 
The Company makes an ongoing assessment of our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, expiration of foreign tax credit and NOL carry-forwards and tax planning strategies. The Company will continue to evaluate the ability to realize our net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis to identify whether any significant changes in circumstances or assumptions have occurred that could materially affect the ability to realize deferred tax assets.
Net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 follows:

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $

 million of NOL carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income, of which $
18.8
 million, $
103.4
 million and $
85.4
 million are associated with the Company’s Korean, Japanese and Canadian subsidiaries, respectively. NOLs from our Japanese subsidiary begin to expire from 2031 through 2033 and NOLs from Canadian subsidiaries begin to expire from 2041 through 2044. The remaining NOLs mainly related to the Company and its Korean subsidiaries which expire at various years through 2038. The Company also has U.S. foreign tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $
37.0
 million as of December 31, 2024, which begin to expire from 2030 through 2034. 
As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $
225.4

The Company is currently under examination by local taxing authorities in the United States and in Canada. The Company has not identified additional uncertain tax positions during the audits. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities.
The Company is currently unaware of any uncertain tax positions that could result in significant additional payments, accruals, or other material deviations from this estimate over the next 12 months.

Segment and Geographic Information
Segment Information 
The Company operates as 
one
 reportable segment, which derives its revenue from paid content, advertising, and IP adaptations revenue streams. Our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The CODM manages the Company as a consolidated ecosystem because the revenue streams are interrelated, and resources are shared.
The CODM uses net income (loss) as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss to assess performance and allocate resources such as employees and capital expenditures. Additionally, the net income (loss) is used to monitor trends in year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter performance comparisons and to compare actual results to forecasts.
The CODM receives and reviews expenses included in segment operating performance regularly. However, the CODM reviews general and administrative expenses on a more disaggregated basis to ensure the resources are in line with its business and operating needs. 
The measure of segment revenue and assets are reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as total sales and the Consolidated Balance Sheets as total assets, respectively.
All intercompany and intra-entity transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Fair Value Measurements
A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Note 1. 
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 should be read in conjunction with the information outlined below. 
F-43
Table of Contents
WEBTOON Entertainment Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The table below presents the valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs generally used in determining the fair value of Level 3 Instruments. 
Level 3 Instruments
Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs
Debt and Equity Securities
Recent third-party investments or pending transactions are considered to be the best evidence for any change in fair value. When these are not available, the following valuation methodologies are used, as appropriate and available (i) Transactions in similar instruments; (ii) discounted cash flow techniques; (iii) third party appraisals; (iv) binomial option pricing models; and (v) industry multiples and public comparables.
Evidence of value in investees includes recent or pending reorganizations (for example, merger proposals, tender offers and debt restructurings) and significant changes in financial metrics, including (i) current financial performance as compared to projected performance; (ii) capitalization rates and multiples; and (iii) market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets.
The tables below present the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the Company’s Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. These ranges do not represent a range of values for any single instrument. For example, the lowest discount rate for a particular redeemable convertible preferred stock investment may be appropriate for valuing that specific debt security but may not be appropriate for valuing any other debt securities in this asset class. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs presented below do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of the Company’s Level 3 assets.

______________
As noted above, the binomial optional pricing model was used in the determination of fair value of Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The significant unobservable inputs used in the binomial option pricing model are the discount rate or market yield used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. An increase in the discount rate or market yield would result in a decrease in the fair value. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates or market yields is risk of default, rating of the investment, call provisions and comparable company investments. 
The following tables present a summary of the Company’s assets categorized within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

 stock options in exchange for non-director services in November 2020. The options contained a performance-based condition which was satisfied upon the completion of the Company's IPO. The Company recorded the transaction as a dividend of $
16.6
 million and a reduction in additional paid-in capital as the director is employed by NAVER (See Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for the treatment of stock-based awards issued to employees of NAVER).
 On September 1, 2024, the merger between LDF and eBIJ became effective, following approval by the Company’s Board of Directors on March 27, 2024. Under the applicable corporate laws of Japan, eBIJ was merged into LDF through an absorption-type merger, with LDF as the surviving entity. Prior to this, eBIJ had been receiving reimbursements from Yahoo for certain costs and expenses incurred under its platform service agreement. The reimbursed amounts primarily related to platform service fees, marketing-related expenses, and other outsourcing fees. However, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Yahoo merged with Line, forming LY, resulting in these transactions being classified as related party transactions for

Variable Interest Entity 
In August 2023, WWS, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Limited Partnership Agreement with NWMC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NAVER and a sister company of WEBTOON, to establish Bootcamp Limited Partnership (“Bootcamp”) pursuant to 
Limited Partnerships Act
 of the Province of Ontario, Canada. Bootcamp distributes a film produced by GPM Boot Productions Inc. which is a film adaptation of a web-novel titled 
Boot Camp
 published on our platform. 
WWS is the general partner (“GP”) of Bootcamp and manages as well as makes all operating decisions over Bootcamp and receives a 
1.0
% variable interest management fee based on contributed capital. NWMC is the sole limited partner (“LP”) and has no unilateral participating or kick-out rights over the GP. Bootcamp is a VIE over which WWS is the primary beneficiary because the LP with the equity at risk is not able to exercise substantive kick-out rights or participating rights and WWS has the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Bootcamp. Accordingly, we consolidated Bootcamp into the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 17. 
Disposition and Business Combinations
Jakga
On March 28, 2024, the Company entered into a stock transfer agreement with a third party (the “Buyer”), pursuant to which the Buyer agreed to acquire 
0.3
% of Jakga voting interests from the Company. The Company completed the sale for consideration of $
0.1
 million  in cash. On the same day, Jakga entered into a share investment agreement with another third party, pursuant to which Jakga issued new shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock representing 
3.5
% of the voting equity interest of Jakga. Following the completion of the stock transfer agreement and the share investment agreement, the Company entered into a shareholder’s agreement to forgo its ability to appoint a member on Jakga’s board of directors to divest Jakga. The stock transfer agreement, share investment agreement, and shareholder’s agreement (collectively, the “Jakga Transactions”) resulted in a dilution of the Company’s ownership to 
49.2
% and losing controlling financial interest in Jakga. The Company deconsolidated Jakga on March 28, 2024 and accounted for the retained common stock as an equity method investment and the retained redeemable convertible preferred stock as a debt security (see additional details related to the redeemable preferred stock in Note 15. 
Fair Value Measurements
). Jakga became a related party of the Company after the deconsolidation. As of the disposition date, the retained common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock in Jakga were measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow model applying a discount rate of 
15.1
% and a terminal growth rate of 
1.0
% incorporating historical financial information, business plans of Jakga,

and market outlook information. The Company recorded a $

 million in cash 
F-50
Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
and accounted for the investment using the equity method. On February 9, 2022, the Company acquired additional shares of Munpia from Premier in exchange for a partial settlement of an outstanding loan with Premier (Premier Loan) of $
91.3
 million. 
As of the acquisition date, the previously held equity method investment and non-controlling interests including redeemable non-controlling interests were measured at fair values using a discounted cash flow model applying a discount rate of 
13.6
% and a terminal growth rate of 
1.0
% incorporating historical financial information, the business plans of the target, and market outlook information. As a result of the remeasurement of the previously held equity method investment, the Company recognized a gain of $
0.1
 million in Other income (loss), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Jakga 
On July 5, 2022, the Company acquired a controlling financial interest in Jakga, a professional agency for web-novel writers, to enhance the Company’s existing product offerings. The Company initially acquired shares of redeemable preferred stock of Jakga representing 
25.9
% of the voting equity interests in November 2020. The Company acquired additional shares of common stock representing 
10.0
% of the voting equity interests in October 2021, redeemable preferred stock representing 
5.4
% of the voting equity interests in March 2022 and common stock representing 
5.0
% of the voting equity interests in July 2022. The common stock and preferred stock were accounted for as an equity method investment and a debt security, respectively. The Company paid $
1.7
 million in cash for the acquisition of additional shares on July 5, 2022 which increased the voting equity interests in Jakga held by the Company to 
50.4
%. The acquisition was considered a step acquisition and accounted for under the acquisition method. 
As of the acquisition date, the previously held equity method investment and debt security and non-controlling interests were measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow model applying a discount rate of 
14.9
% and a terminal growth rate of 
1.0
% incorporating historical financial information, business plans of the target, and market outlook information. As a result of the remeasurement of the previously held equity method investment and debt security, the Company recognized a gain of $
2.6
 million in Other income (loss), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
eBIJ 
On March 31, 2022, the Company acquired a controlling financial interest in eBOOK Initiative Japan Co., Ltd., an online service for eBooks in Japan to strengthen its competitiveness in web-comic and web-novel business in Japan. The Company initially acquired 
33.9
% of the shares of eBIJ in November 2021. The shares were accounted for as an equity method investment. On March 31, 2022 the Company paid $
52.5
 million in cash and exchanged its own common stock with fair value of $
70.9
 million to acquire additional shares of eBIJ which increased the shares of eBIJ held by the Company to 
100.0
%. Given the acquisition date fair value of eBIJ is more reliably measurable than the Company’s common stock exchanged, the $
70.9
 million fair value of the Company’s common stock exchanged was determined based on the public trading value before the tender offer. The cash consideration transferred is included in “Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired” in investing activities of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The acquisition was considered a step acquisition and accounted for under the acquisition method. 
On March 31, 2022, in conjunction with the acquisition of a controlling financial interest in eBIJ by Company, eBIJ entered into an Amendment to Business Partnership Agreement for Electronic Book Business with a former stockholder pursuant to which the terms of a preexisting arrangement with the former stockholder were modified. The modified arrangement includes the payments to the former stockholder based on a percentage of eBIJ’s future revenues, payable until the Company completes an initial public offering, which represents contingent consideration in the business combination that is considered as an assumed liability. ASC Topic 805 requires that contingent consideration classified as a liability to be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and be re-measured each reporting period with subsequent adjustments recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. We estimate the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities using an income-based valuation methodology that is calculated by weighting the cash flow from payments to the former stockholder by the annual probability of an initial public offering success, discounted using weighted average cost of capital. At the acquisition date on March 31, 2022, contingent consideration presented as other non-current liability totaled $
13.9
 million.

11.9
 million in Other income (loss), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2022.
LOCUS 
On March 31, 2022, the Company acquired 
53.6
% of LOCUS and its subsidiaries, a 3D animation and visual special effects production company. This acquisition allows the Company to build an intellectual property value chain, including visualization of the Company’s web-comics and web-novel intellectual property. The fair value of the purchase consideration was $
23.2
 million paid in cash at closing which is reflected in “Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired” under investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method. 
JHS 
On August 22, 2022, Munpia, a partially-owned subsidiary of the Parent, acquired a controlling financial interest in Studio JHS Inc. (“JHS”), a web-novel and web-comics content creator.

4.
The Company classified Namu Actors under the equity method by acquiring more than 20% of its ownership interest in 2024.

6.
In March 2024, the Company gained significant influence by obtaining the right to appoint one board member, reclassifying the investment from an equity security to the equity method even though the Company holds less than 20.0% of the voting stock.
7.
In December 2024, the Company made a new capital contribution and secured the right to appoint one board member, resulting in the classification of the investment under the equity method due to significant influence even though the Company holds less than 20.0% of the voting stock.

Note 20. 
Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest in Subsidiary
In February 2022, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Munpia and recognized non-controlling interest at its fair value. In connection to the Company’s acquisition of Munpia in February 2022, the Company entered into a shareholders’ agreement under which the third-party former majority owner of Munpia has the right to require the Company to redeem its Munpia shares if certain events that are not solely within the Company’s control occur. The redemption price on the put option shall equal $
26.20
 (the equivalent of KRW 
33,251
) per share plus 
15
% per annum. 
As a portion of the Munpia shares held by holders other than the Company are redeemable, such shares must be classified outside of stockholders’ equity. The Company does not consider the redemption of the redeemable non-controlling interest probable of being redeemable. Accordingly, the redeemable non-controlling interest will not be remeasured until the redeemable non-controlling interest is probable of becoming redeemable. During the year 2023, the third-party former owner of Munpia sold a portion of their Munpia shares to their employees and other third-parties, and the redemption rights under the shareholders’ agreement did not transfer along with the shares that were sold. Accordingly, such shares sold are no longer redeemable and the shares that were sold were reclassified from redeemable non-controlling interest to non-controlling interest. 
Prior to the acquisition, in September 2021, the Company entered into a side letter agreement with a third party, Cloudary, under which the Cloudary had the option to require the Company to purchase Cloudary’s Munpia shares for $
26.20
 per share (the equivalent of KRW 
33,251
). Such put option was set to expire upon the earlier of (i) March 2023 or (ii) when Cloudary holds less than 
5
% of the outstanding shares of Munpia. When the Company acquired Munpia in February 2022, the shares held by Cloudary were recognized as redeemable non-controlling interest. In December 2023, Cloudary exercised its put option and the Company purchased 
425,016
 of Cloudary’s Munpia shares. As a result of the exercise, Cloudary owned less than 
5
% of the outstanding shares of Munpia, and the remaining Munpia shares held by Cloudary were no longer redeemable. Accordingly, the remaining Cloudary owned shares were reclassified from redeemable non-controlling interest to non-controlling interest.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below. However, after giving full consideration to such material weaknesses, and the additional analyses and other procedures that we performed to ensure that our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods disclosed in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has determined that the Company had the following material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting: 
•
The Company did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with its financial reporting requirements. Specifically, the Company lacked a sufficient complement of resources with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately. 
•
The Company did not design and maintain effective controls related to the period-end financial reporting process, including, procedures and controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures.
Remediation Progress
In addition to the material weaknesses described above, we previously reported material weaknesses related to information technology (IT) general controls and segregation of duties. In response to the IT general controls deficiency, which was specific to certain subsidiary locations, we implemented program change management controls, user access controls and program development testing and approval controls, and as a result of such efforts, we believe the material weakness is remediated as of December 31, 2024.  In response to the segregation of duties deficiency, which was also specific to certain subsidiary locations, the deficiencies have been addressed by transitioning the subsidiaries to Webtoon’s ERP system (Neon) during the period, a system that is configured to segregate the preparer and reviewer for key financial reporting related activities, such as the preparation and approval of journal entries. As a result of such efforts, we believe the material weakness is remediated as of December 31, 2024.
We are continuing to remain focused on remediation of the remaining material weaknesses outlined above, and our ongoing remediation efforts include:
•
The continued onboarding of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting specialists to enhance the financial reporting function and establish a robust financial and system control framework; and 
•
The continued strengthening of controls around our financial accounting closing, reporting and disclosure processes. During the period we successfully implemented various financial closing controls including controls relating to our balance sheet reconciliation process and our accounting policies. 
157
Table of Contents
We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the internal control deficiencies that led to our material weaknesses, that the material weaknesses will be remediated on a timely basis, or that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Annual Report does not include a report of management’s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by the rules of the SEC for newly public companies.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We are taking actions to remediate the material weaknesses relating to our internal control over financial reporting. Except as otherwise described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the year ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Item 9B. Other Information
During the three months ended December 31, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) 
adopted
 or 
terminated
 any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K. 
Restricted Stock Unit Grants
On March 7, 2025, the Board approved a grant of 22,802 restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to Chankyu Park pursuant to the Company’s 2024 Omnibus Incentive Plan.

Upon the termination of Mr. Park’s employment with the Company, any portion of such RSUs that is not vested as of the date of termination shall automatically expire.
