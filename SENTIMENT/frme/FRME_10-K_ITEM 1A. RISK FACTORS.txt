ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.
RISK FACTORS
There are a number of factors, including those specified below, that may adversely affect the Corporation’s business, financial results or stock price.  Additional risks that the Corporation currently does not know about or currently views as immaterial may also impair the Corporation’s business or adversely impact its financial results or stock price.
Operational Risks
•
The Corporation’s business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics or other infectious disease outbreaks. 
An epidemic, a pandemic or any other infectious disease outbreak may result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect general commercial activity, the global economy (including the states and local economies in which we operate) and financial markets.
Epidemics, pandemics or other infectious disease outbreaks may result in the Corporation closing certain offices and may require us to limit how customers conduct business through our branch network.  If our employees continue or are required to work remotely, the Corporation will be exposed to increased cybersecurity risks such as phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, all of which could expose us to liability and could seriously disrupt our business operations.  Furthermore, the Corporation’s business operations may be disrupted due to vendors and third-party service providers being unable to work or provide services effectively during such a health crisis, including because of illness, quarantines or other government actions.
22
PART I: ITEM 1A., ITEM 1B., AND ITEM 1C.
In addition, an epidemic, a pandemic or another infectious disease outbreak could significantly impact households and businesses, or cause limitations on commercial activity, increased unemployment and general economic and financial instability. An economic slow-down in, or a reversal in an economic recovery of, the regions in which we conduct our business could result in declines in loan demand and collateral values.  Furthermore, negative impacts on our customers caused by such a health crisis could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans. Moreover, governmental and regulatory actions taken in response to an epidemic, a pandemic or another infectious disease outbreak may include decreased interest rates, which could adversely impact the Corporation’s interest margins and may lead to decreases in the Corporation’s net interest income.
The extent to which a widespread health crisis may impact the Corporation’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the crisis, the potential for seasonal or other resurgences, actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties to contain and treat such epidemics, pandemics or other infectious disease outbreaks, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.  Moreover, the effects of a widespread health crisis may heighten many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.  As a result, the negative effects on the Corporation’s business, results of operations and financial condition from epidemics, pandemics or other infectious disease outbreaks could be material.
•
The Corporation’s allowances for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.
The Corporation maintains allowances for credit losses for loans, off-balance sheet credit exposures, and debt securities to provide for defaults and nonperformance, which represent estimates of expected losses over the remaining contractual lives of the loan and debt security portfolios. These estimates are the result of the Corporation’s continuing evaluation of specific credit risks and loss experience, current loan and debt security portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions, industry concentrations, reasonable and supportable forecasts for future conditions, and other factors that may indicate losses. The determination of the appropriate levels of the allowances for loan, off-balance sheet credit exposures, and debt security credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires the Corporation to make estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. As a result, the allowances may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and future allowances for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
The Corporation adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments as amended, on January 1, 2021, which replaced the previous “incurred loss” model for measuring credit losses with an “expected life of loan loss” model described above, referred to as the CECL model.  Consistent with rules adopted by federal banking regulators, the Corporation has elected to phase in the cumulative effect of the adoption on its regulatory capital, at a rate of 25 percent per year, over a three-year transition period that began on January 1, 2021.  Under that phase-in schedule, the cumulative effect of the adoption was fully reflected in regulatory capital on January 1, 2024. 
Adoption of the CECL methodology has substantially changed how the Corporation calculates its allowances for credit losses and the ongoing impact of the adoption is dependent on various factors, including credit quality, macroeconomic forecasts and conditions, composition of our loans and securities portfolios, and other management judgments.  See NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Material additions to the Corporation’s allowance through provision expense would materially decrease its net income. There can be no assurance that the Corporation’s monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that the Corporation’s allowances for credit losses will be adequate to cover actual losses.
•
The Corporation may suffer losses in its loan portfolio despite its underwriting practices.
The Corporation seeks to mitigate the risks inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices.  The Corporation’s strategy for credit risk management includes conservative credit policies and underwriting criteria for all loans, as well as an overall credit limit for each customer significantly below legal lending limits.  The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a regional geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit quality reviews and management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality. There is a continuous review of the loan portfolio, including an internally administered loan “watch” list and an independent loan review.  The evaluation takes into consideration identified credit problems, as well as the possibility of losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified.  Although the Corporation believes that its underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans it makes, the Corporation may incur losses on loans due to the factors previously discussed.
•
The Corporation’s wholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits or support future growth.
As part of the Corporation’s liquidity management, a number of funding sources are used, including core deposits and repayments and maturities of loans and investments.  Sources also include brokered certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased and FHLB advances. Negative operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to an inability to replace these additional funding sources at maturity.  The Corporation’s financial flexibility could be constrained if we are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates.  Finally, if the Corporation is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover the costs. In this case the Corporation’s results of operations and financial condition would be negatively affected.
•
The Corporation relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity needs.
The Corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from its bank and non-bank subsidiaries.  The Corporation receives substantially all of its cash from dividends paid by its subsidiaries.  These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the Corporation’s stock and interest and principal on its debt.  Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank subsidiaries may pay to the Corporation.
23
PART I: ITEM 1A., ITEM 1B., AND ITEM 1C.
•
Acquisitions may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties.
The Corporation regularly explores opportunities to acquire banks, financial institutions, or other financial services businesses or assets.  The Corporation cannot predict the number, size or timing of acquisitions.  Difficulty in integrating an acquired business or company may cause the Corporation not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from the acquisition.  The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition (run-off), loss of key employees, disruption of the Corporation’s business or the business of the acquired company, or otherwise adversely affect the Corporation’s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.  Also, the negative effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected.  The Corporation may also issue equity securities in connection with acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to current stockholders.
•
The Corporation faces operational risks because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions.
The Corporation operates in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from the Corporation’s operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the Corporation, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements and business continuation and disaster recovery.  This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.  In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, the Corporation could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.
•
Cyber incidents and other security breaches at the Corporation, its service providers or counterparties, or in the business community or markets may negatively impact the Corporation’s business or performance.
The increased use of, and dependence on, information management systems in order to engage with customers and conduct business necessarily creates cyber risk.  Despite the significant resources and security measures used by the Corporation, the incentives for threat actors to obtain financial payment information and customer non-public information, or to conduct ransomware will continue to exist.  Cyber breach statistics over the past several years evidence the targeting of numerous banking institutions and credit bureaus.  Phishing attempts have also significantly increased and political conflict also presents cyber threats by nation states. 
Operational risk is inherent in the Corporation’s activities and can present itself in numerous ways, including internal or external fraud, business disruptions or failures, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, cyber breach, or failure of third parties, among other events.  The result of these could be reputational harm, financial losses, or litigation and regulatory fines for the Bank.  The Corporation operates in a fashion that allows operational risk to be in line with its risk appetite.  To govern, monitor and control operational risk, the Corporation maintains an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Program, which sets thresholds for risk appetite by key risk areas, such as strategic risk and operational risk.  These thresholds are monitored by the Compliance and Internal Audit Departments and key metrics are reported to management and Board committees.
Use of third-party software and services also exposes the Corporation to cybersecurity risk as numerous service providers host critical data or have direct contact with our bank customers.  Although the Corporation adheres to industry standard practices in conducting thorough due diligence of vendors and contract management, should a vendor experience a breach, similar to the MOVEit breach in 2023 which impacted a vendor utilized by the Bank, the Bank could still suffer reputational harm, and potentially financial losses.  Expanded use of cloud-based technologies and providing our customers more internet-based product offerings to continue to remain competitive will serve to increase these potential risks.  The Corporation’s third-party management program helps to mitigate risks posed by reliance on third and fourth parties.
To combat these ever-present cyber risks, the Corporation maintains a comprehensive Information Security Program, which includes annual risk assessments, an Incident Response Plan, and a layered control environment meant to detect, prevent, and limit unauthorized or harmful actions across our information technology environment.  Standards over information security are Board-approved and various types of control testing is conducted throughout the year, both by internal parties and external ones.  Findings are actioned on throughout the year and reported to various committees.  The Corporation has adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework for the management and development of cyber-security controls and is an active participant in the financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center. 
Each year the Information Security Department conducts a cyber incident tabletop exercise for the bank’s incident response teams.  The bank’s executive management team participates in the exercise every two years.  The purpose of these tabletops is to simulate a cyber event and work through the event using our Incident Response Plan.  This allows our incident response team to become familiar with the logistics of the plan, as well as provide feedback to improve the process and plan.  External subject matter experts, such as Bank legal counsel, forensic advisors, marketing agency and insurance broker participate in these exercises.  
Management has established an Information Security Committee in order to assist executive management and the Board of Directors of the Bank in fulfilling their oversight responsibilities related to information security.  The Committee reports its activities, key conclusions and recommendations to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee and the Board’s Risk and Credit Policy Committee of the Board on a quarterly basis. 
At the Information Security Committee, security-related policies and standards are reviewed and approved, annual risk assessment results and action plans are noted, annual penetration test reports shared, current security incidents discussed, and relevant cyber risks and trends are presented.
24
PART I: ITEM 1A., ITEM 1B., AND ITEM 1C.
The Corporation’s Board of Directors has delegated primary responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity risk to its Risk and Credit Policy Committee, with its Audit Committee also considering cyber risk as part of financial oversight.  The Information Security Department provides an annual update to the Risk and Credit Policy Committee of the Board on the state of the Information Security Program.  This cybersecurity “deep dive” includes review of key security incidents and review of the Information Security Policy, Information Security Program, the Incident Response Plan, and the Acceptable Use Policy.  The Board is then presented with the update by the Chair of the Risk and Credit Policy Committee.
The Board considers cybersecurity risks in business strategy by getting updates on the Bank’s cybersecurity risk assessment.  It assesses the experience of management personnel responsible for preventing, mitigating, detecting and remediating any cyber incidents, including the Chief Information Security Officer.
In 2022, the Board appointed Jason Sondhi to its Board of Directors.  Mr. Sondhi is the Board’s cybersecurity expert.  Mr. Sondhi has experience managing companies who provide endpoint detection and incident response, vulnerability scans, security information and event management, security employee training and vCISO services.  
•
The Corporation continually encounters technological change.
The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services.  The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables the financial institutions to better serve customers to reduce costs.  The Corporation’s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Corporation’s operations.  The Corporation may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers.  Failure to successfully keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect the Corporation’s growth, revenue and profit. In addition, the Corporation relies upon the expertise and support of third-party service providers to help implement, maintain and/or service certain of its core technology solutions.  If the Corporation cannot effectively manage these service providers, the service parties fail to materially perform, or the Corporation was to falter in any of the other noted areas, its business or performance could be negatively impacted.
•
The Corporation is subject to environmental liability risk associated with our Bank branches and any real estate collateral we acquire upon foreclosure.
A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property.  During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties.  The costs associated with investigation and remediation activities could be substantial.  If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, including damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property.  Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating foreclosure, these actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards.
We also have an extensive branch network, owning branch locations throughout the areas we serve that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks.  Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and could materially reduce the affected property’s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property.  The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•
Significant legal actions could subject the Corporation to substantial uninsured liabilities.
The Corporation is from time to time subject to claims related to its operations.  These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by the Corporation’s regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs.  To protect itself from the cost of these claims, the Corporation maintains insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that it believes are appropriate for its operations.  However, the Corporation’s insurance coverage may not cover all claims against the Corporation or continue to be available to the Corporation at a reasonable cost.  As a result, the Corporation may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect the Corporation’s results of operations and financial condition.
•
The Corporation’s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.
Management regularly reviews and updates the Corporation’s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures.  Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.  Any failure or circumvention of the Corporation’s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
•
The Corporation’s methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective.
The Corporation maintains a comprehensive risk management program designed to identify, quantify, manage, mitigate, monitor, aggregate, and report risks.  However, instruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated.  As a result, the Corporation may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
25
PART I: ITEM 1A., ITEM 1B., AND ITEM 1C.
•
The Corporation’s reported financial results depend on management’s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.
The Corporation’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation’s management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods, so they comply with GAAP and reflect management’s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report the Corporation’s financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in the Corporation reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.  Certain accounting policies are critical to presenting the Corporation’s financial condition and results, and require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain.  Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates.  These critical accounting policies include:  the allowances for credit losses; the valuation of investment securities; the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets; pension accounting; and the accounting related to acquisitions. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, the Corporation may be required to do one or more of the following:  significantly increase the allowances for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided; recognize significant provision for impairment of its investment securities; recognize significant impairment on its goodwill and intangible assets; significantly increase its pension liability; or modify the purchase price allocation of an acquisition.  As part of its function of assisting the Corporation’s Board of Directors in discharging its responsibility of ensuring all types of risk to the organization are properly being managed, mitigated and monitored by management, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees management’s accounting policies and methods.  For more information, refer to NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
•
A write-down of all or part of the Corporation’s goodwill could materially reduce its net income and net worth.
At December 31, 2024, the Corporation had goodwill of $712.0 million recorded on its consolidated balance sheet.  Under ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, the Corporation is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis, if events or changes indicate that the asset may be impaired.  An impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over the fair value of goodwill.  The fair value is determined based on internal valuations using management’s assumptions of future growth rates, future attrition, discount rates, multiples of earnings or other relevant factors.  The resulting estimated fair value could result in material write-downs of goodwill and recording of impairment losses. Such a write-down could materially reduce the Corporation’s net income and overall net worth.  The Corporation also cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the fair value of goodwill.  Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the effect of the economic environment on the Corporation’s customer base, or a material negative change in its relationship with significant customers.
•
Changes in accounting standards could materially impact the Corporation’s financial statements.
From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Corporation’s financial statements.  These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the Corporation records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  In some cases, the Corporation could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively; resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.
•
Negative publicity could damage the Corporation’s reputation and adversely impact its business and financial results.
Reputation risk, or the risk to the Corporation’s earnings and capital from negative publicity, is inherent in the Corporation’s business.  Negative publicity can result from the Corporation’s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities.  Negative publicity can adversely affect the Corporation’s ability to keep and attract customers and can expose the Corporation to litigation and regulatory action. Although the Corporation takes steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with customers and other constituencies, the Corporation is inherently exposed to this risk.
•
Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to the Corporation’s environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on the Corporation or expose it to new or additional risks.
Companies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices and disclosure.  Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG-related compliance costs for the Corporation as well as among our suppliers, vendors and various other parties within our supply chain could result in increases to our overall operational costs.  Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, access to capital, and our stock price.  New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure.
26
PART I: ITEM 1A., ITEM 1B., AND ITEM 1C.
•
Climate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect the Corporation’s business and results of operations.
The global business community has increased its political and social awareness surrounding the state of the global environment and the issue of climate change.  Further, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives related to climate change.  Similar and even more expansive initiatives are expected under the current administration, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks’ risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change.  The lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change make it impossible to predict how specifically climate change may impact our financial condition and results of operations.  To the extent our customers experience unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters attributed to climate change, the value of real property securing the loans in our portfolios may be negatively impacted.  Additionally, if insurance obtained by our borrowers is insufficient to cover any disaster-related losses sustained to the collateral, or if insurance coverage is otherwise unavailable to our borrowers, the collateral securing our loans may be negatively impacted by climate change, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations.  Further, the effects of weather disasters attributed to climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on our customers and impact the communities in which we operate.  Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  
•
The Corporation may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice.
The Corporation has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to common stockholders.  The payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on the Corporation’s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Corporation’s Board of Directors.
Market and Industry Risks
•
The Corporation’s business and financial results are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions.
The Corporation’s business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and abroad.  These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, monetary supply, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, and the strength of the United States economy and the state and local economies in which the Corporation operates.  The Corporation's offices are primarily located in Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. Worsening economic conditions in our market areas could negatively impact the financial condition, results of operations and stock price of the Corporation.  For example, a prolonged economic downturn, increases in unemployment, or other events that affect household and/or corporate incomes could result in deterioration of credit quality, an increase in the allowances for credit losses, or reduced demand for loan or fee-based products and services.  Changes in the financial performance and condition of the Corporation’s borrowers could negatively affect repayment of those borrowers’ loans.  In addition, changes in securities market conditions and monetary fluctuations could adversely affect the availability and terms of funding necessary to meet the Corporation’s liquidity needs.
•
Changes in the domestic interest rate environment could affect the Corporation’s net interest income as well as the valuation of assets and liabilities.
The operations of financial institutions, such as the Corporation, are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings.  An institution’s net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are affected by prevailing economic conditions, by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and by the policies of various regulatory agencies.  In addition to affecting profitability, changes in interest rates can impact the valuation of assets and liabilities.  For example, changes in reference rates linked to financial instruments, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), may adversely affect the value of financial instruments the Corporation holds or issues and related net interest income. Rate changes can also affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans which in turn affect loss rates on those assets.  Also, the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposit accounts, may decline resulting in the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments.  Direct investments, such as U.S. Government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, including mutual funds, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements.
As a result of a widespread health crisis such as an epidemic, a pandemic or another infectious disease outbreak, the Federal Reserve may take steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects.  For example, as a part of the unprecedented containment efforts and financial assistance undertaken by the U.S. Government relating to COVID-19, in March 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (the “FOMC”) had reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 percent to 0.25 percent.  The Federal Reserve also initiated a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and other investments, and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.  These activities also had the effect of suppressing long-term interest rates.
Beginning in the first half of 2022, in response to growing signs of inflation, the FOMC began increasing the federal funds benchmark rapidly and the Federal Reserve announced its intention to take actions to mitigate inflationary pressures by continuing to further reduce its purchase program.  Rapid changes in interest rates makes it challenging for the Bank to balance its loan and deposit portfolios, which may adversely affect the Corporation’s results of operations by reducing asset yields or spreads or having other adverse impacts on our business.  As discussed above, the increased market interest rates could also adversely affect the ability of our floating-rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations.  If this occurred, it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge-offs, which could adversely affect our business. Conversely, decreases in interest rates could result in an acceleration of loan prepayments.
27
PART I: ITEM 1A., ITEM 1B., AND ITEM 1C.
In response to easing inflation pressures, the Federal Reserve is expected to decrease the target federal funds rate in 2025.  If the Federal Reserve were to aggressively lower the target federal funds, those lower rates could pressure our interest rate spread and may adversely affect our results of operations.  On the other hand, increases in interest rates, to combat inflation or otherwise, may result in a change in the mix of the Bank’s noninterest and interest-bearing accounts.  We are unable to predict changes in interest rates, which are affected by factors beyond our control, including inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply and other changes in financial markets.  However, generally, if the interest rates on the Bank’s interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on its interest-earning assets, the result would be a reduction in net interest income and with it, a reduction in net earnings.
•
Changes in the laws, regulations and policies governing banks and financial services companies could alter the Corporation’s business environment and adversely affect operations.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States.  Its fiscal and monetary policies determine in a large part the Corporation’s cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the Corporation’s net interest margin.  Federal Reserve Board policies can also materially affect the value of financial instruments that the Corporation holds, such as debt securities.  The Corporation and the Bank are heavily regulated at the federal and state levels.  This regulation is to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole. Congress and state legislatures and federal and state agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes.  After the Great Recession, efforts to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions, financial market stability, the transparency and liquidity of financial markets, and consumer and investor protection resulted in increased regulation in the financial services industry.  Regulatory agencies have intensified their examination practices and enforcement of laws and regulations.  Compliance with regulations and other supervisory initiatives could increase the Corporation’s expenses and reduce revenues by limiting the types of financial services and products that the Corporation offers and/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. See a description of recent legislation in the “REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF FIRST MERCHANTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES” section of Item 1: Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The banking industry, as well as the broader economy, may be subject to new legislation, regulation, and government policy.  Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in a way that cannot accurately be predicted.  In addition, our financial condition and results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.
Certain regulations require the Corporation to maintain certain capital ratios, such as the ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-based assets.  Both the Dodd-Frank Act, which reformed the regulation of financial institutions in a comprehensive manner, and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, which increase both the amount and quality of capital that financial institutions must hold, impact capital requirements.  If the Corporation is unable to satisfy these heightened regulatory capital requirements, due to a decline in the value of the loan portfolio or otherwise, raising additional capital or disposing of assets could be required.  Additional capital could be raised by selling additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock, which could significantly dilute the ownership percentages of stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.  Events or circumstances in the capital markets generally may increase capital costs and impair the ability to raise capital at any given time.  Disposal of assets cannot guarantee disposal at prices appropriate for the disposition, and future operating results could be negatively affected.
•
Our FDIC insurance premiums may increase, and special assessments could be made, which might negatively impact our results of operations.
Since the Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by premiums and assessments paid by insured banks, our FDIC insurance premium could increase in future years depending upon the FDIC’s actual loss experience, changes in the Bank’s financial condition or capital strength, and future conditions in the banking industry.  See the “Deposit Insurance” section of “REGULATION AND SUPERVISION OF FIRST MERCHANTS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES” in Item 1: Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
•
The banking and financial services industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could intensify and adversely affect the Corporation’s financial results.
The Corporation operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.  The Corporation competes with other banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit unions and investment companies.  In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-bank, financial technology companies to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks.  Many of the Corporation’s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints, greater resources and lower cost structures allowing them to aggressively price their products.  Such competitive pressures make it more difficult for the Corporation to attract and retain customers across its business lines.  Also, the demands of adapting to industry changes in technology and systems, on which the Corporation and financial services industry are highly dependent, could present operational issues and require capital spending.
Additionally, our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people.  Competition for the best people in many activities for which the Corporation is engaged is intense and we may not be able to hire people and retain them.  The unexpected loss of services of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations because of their customer relationships, skills, knowledge of our markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.  In addition, the scope and content of U.S. banking regulators’ policies on incentive compensation, as well as changes to these policies, could adversely affect our ability to hire, retain and motivate our key employees.

•
Changes in tax legislation could materially impact the Corporation’s business and financial results and the Corporation may have exposure to tax liabilities that are larger than it anticipates.
The tax laws applicable to our business activities, including the laws of the United States and the State governments where the Corporation has tax nexus, are subject to interpretation and may change over time.  From time to time, legislative initiatives, such as corporate tax rate changes, which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our deferred tax assets or our tax positions or liabilities, may be enacted.  The taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our tax positions, which could increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.  In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates or by changes in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. We are subject to audit and review by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.  Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our provision for income taxes and other liabilities requires significant judgment by management.  Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
•
Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as recent bank failures or concerns involving liquidity, may have a material effect on our operations.
Recent events relating to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March 2023 have caused general uncertainty and concerns regarding the adequacy of liquidity in the banking sector as a whole.  A financial institution’s liquidity reflects its ability to meet customer demand for loans, accommodating possible outflows in deposits and accessing alternative sources of funds when needed, while at the same time taking advantage of interest rate market opportunities.  The ability to manage liquidity is fundamental to a financial institution’s business and success.  The bank failures in March 2023 highlight the potential results of an insured depository institution unexpectedly having to obtain needed liquidity to satisfy deposit withdrawal requests, including how quickly such requests can accelerate once uninsured depositors lose confidence in an institution’s ability to satisfy its obligations to depositors.  Current market uncertainties and other external factors may impact the competitive landscape for deposits in the banking industry in an unpredictable manner. In addition, the rising interest rate environment has continued to increase competition for liquidity and the premium at which liquidity is available to meet funding needs.  These possible impacts may adversely affect our future operating results, including net income, and negatively impact capital.
•
Regulatory requirements arising from recent events in the financial services industry, or the application of current regulations, could increase our expenses and affect our operations. 
We anticipate the potential of new regulations for banks of similar size to the Bank, designed to address the recent developments in the financial services industry, which may increase our costs of doing business and reduce our profitability. Among other things, there may be an increased focus by both regulators and investors on deposit composition and the level of uninsured deposits.  We also expect that another result of the recent bank failures, as well as any future bank failures, will be an increase to our FDIC insurance premiums in future years, further increasing our cost of doing business.
General Risk Factors
•
A disaster, natural or otherwise, acts of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments could adversely affect the Corporation’s business, directly or indirectly.
Disasters (such as tornadoes, floods, and other severe weather conditions, pandemics, fires, and other catastrophic accidents or events) and terrorist activities and the impact of these occurrences cannot be predicted.  Such occurrences could harm the Corporation’s operations and financial condition directly through interference with communications and through the destruction of facilities and operational, financial and management information systems and/or indirectly by adversely affecting economic and industry conditions.  These events could prevent the Corporation from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling its flow of business by affecting borrowers, depositors, suppliers or other counterparties.  The Corporation’s ability to mitigate the adverse impact of these occurrences would depend in part on the Corporation’s business continuity planning, the ability to anticipate any such event occurring, the preparedness of national or regional emergency responders, and continuity planning of parties the Corporation deals with.
•
The Corporation’s stock price can be volatile.
The Corporation’s stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, including: actual or anticipated variations in the Corporation’s quarterly operating results; recommendations by securities analysts; significant acquisitions or business combinations; strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Corporation; new technology used or services offered by the Corporation’s competitors; news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the banking and financial services industry, and changes in government regulations. General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, including terrorist attacks, increased inflation, economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, credit loss trends or currency fluctuations, could also cause the Corporation’s stock price to decrease, regardless of the Corporation’s operating results.

ITEM 1C. THE CORPORATION’S CYBERSECURITY PROCESSES, POLICIES AND GOVERNANCE.
The increased use of, and dependence on, information management systems in order to engage with customers and conduct business necessarily creates cyber risk.  Despite the significant resources and security measures used by the Corporation, the incentives for threat actors to obtain financial payment information and customer non-public information, or to conduct ransomware will continue to exist.  Cyber breach statistics over the past several years evidence the targeting of numerous banking institutions and credit bureaus.  Phishing attempts have also significantly increased and political conflict also presents cyber threats by nation states.

Operational risk is inherent in the Corporation’s activities and can present itself in numerous ways, including internal or external fraud, business disruptions or failures, noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, cyber breach, or failure of third parties, among other events.  The result of these could be reputational harm, financial losses, or litigation and regulatory fines for the Bank.  The Corporation operates in a fashion that allows operational risk to be in line with its risk appetite.  
To govern, monitor and control operational risk, the Corporation maintains an ERM Program, which sets thresholds for risk appetite by key risk areas, such as strategic risk and operational risk.
  These thresholds are monitored by the Compliance and Internal Audit Departments and key metrics are reported to management and Board committees.  The ERM Program includes managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.

Use of third-party software and services also exposes the Corporation to cybersecurity risk as numerous service providers host critical data or have direct contact with our bank customers.
  Although the Corporation adheres to industry standard practices in conducting thorough due diligence of vendors and contract management, should a vendor experience a breach the bank could still suffer reputational harm, and potentially financial losses.  Expanded use of cloud-based technologies and providing our customers more internet-based product offerings to continue to remain competitive will serve to increase these potential risks.  The Corporation’s third party risk management program helps to mitigate risks posed by reliance on third and fourth parties.  Governance of third parties includes a due diligence and risk assessment prior to contract execution, with oversight completed based on a frequency defined by the third parties risk profile.

To combat these ever-present cyber risks, the Corporation maintains a comprehensive Information Security Program, which includes annual risk assessments, an Incident Response Plan, and a layered control environment meant to detect, prevent, and limit unauthorized or harmful actions across our information technology environment.  Policies over information security are Board-approved and various types of control testing is conducted throughout the year, both by internal and external parties.  Findings are actioned on throughout the year and reported to various committees.  The Corporation has adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework for the management and development of cybersecurity controls and is an active participant in the financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
The Corporation’s 
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
 is responsible for assessing and managing the Corporation’s risks from cybersecurity threats.  
The CISO is an active Certified Information Security Systems Professional and has been with the organization for 18 years with over 21 years of experience in technology infrastructure and security.
The Information Security Department conducts cyber incident tabletop exercises on an ongoing basis.  These exercises vary by topic, but may include internal incident response teams, executive management, and third parties that provide services across forensic, legal, and public relations capabilities.  The purpose of these tabletops is to simulate a cyber event and work through the event using our Incident Response Plan. This allows our incident response team to become familiar with the logistics of the plan, as well as provide feedback to improve the process and plan.  External subject matter experts, such as Bank legal counsel, forensic advisors, marketing agency and insurance broker participate in these exercises.  
Management has established an Information Security Committee in order to assist executive management and the Board of Directors of the Bank in fulfilling their oversight responsibilities related to information security. The Corporation’s Information Security Committee consists of members with diverse experience, including the Corporation’s leaders from information security, enterprise risk management, legal, bank protection, internal audit and various business units. The Corporation’s information security professionals have a range of varying cybersecurity experience and education, many of whom have substantial experience assessing and managing cybersecurity initiatives and hold certain cybersecurity certificates. The Corporation uses multiple assessors, consultants, auditors and other third parties in the fulfillment of the information security program.  These third parties participate in testing and validation processes, as well as the execution of certain program-related controls.  The Committee reports its activities, key conclusions and recommendations to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee and the Board’s Risk and Credit Policy Committee of the Board on a quarterly basis.  At the Information Security Committee, security-related policies and standards are reviewed and recommended for approval, annual risk assessment results and action plans are noted, annual penetration test reports shared, current security incidents discussed, and relevant cyber risks and trends are presented.
The Corporation’s Board of Directors has delegated primary responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity risk to its 
Risk and Credit Policy Committee
, with its Audit Committee also considering cyber risk as part of financial oversight.  
The Information Security Department provides an annual update to the Risk and Credit Policy Committee of the Board on the state of the Information Security Program.
  This cybersecurity “deep dive” includes review of key security incidents and review of the Information Security Policy, Information Security Program, the Incident Response Plan, and the Acceptable Use Policy.  The Board is then presented with the update by the Chair of the Risk and Credit Policy Committee.
The Board considers cybersecurity risks in business strategy by getting updates on the Bank’s cybersecurity risk assessment.  It assesses the experience of management personnel responsible for preventing, mitigating, detecting and remediating any cyber incidents, including the Chief Information Security Officer.
In 2022, the Board appointed Jason Sondhi to its Board of Directors. Mr. Sondhi has experience managing companies who provide endpoint detection and incident response, vulnerability scans, security information and event management, security employee training and vCISO services.  Mr. Sondhi’s cybersecurity expertise assists the Board in overseeing management’s cybersecurity related efforts.
