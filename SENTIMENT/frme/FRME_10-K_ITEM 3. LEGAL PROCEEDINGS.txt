CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Generally accepted accounting principles require management to apply significant judgment to certain accounting, reporting and disclosure matters.  Management must use assumptions and estimates to apply those principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical.  The judgments and assumptions made are based upon historical experience or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions, actual results could differ from estimates, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  For a complete discussion of the Corporation’s significant accounting policies see NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans
As discussed in NOTE 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the allowance for credit losses on loans is a contra-asset valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected.  The amount of allowance represents management’s best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument.  Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.  While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, the Corporation qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not inherently considered in the quantitative modeling process, but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within the loan portfolio.  These adjustments may increase or decrease the estimate of expected credit losses based upon the assessed level of risk for each qualitative factor.  The various risks that may be considered in making qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, (ii) changes in the existence, growth and effect of any concentrations in credit, (iii)  changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections, write-offs, and recoveries, (iv) changes in the quality of the credit review function, (v) changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff, and (vi) other environmental factors such as regulatory, legal and technological considerations, as well as competition.
While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond management’s control, which includes, but is not limited to, the performance of the loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2024
The Corporation reported net income available to common stockholders and diluted earnings per common share for the year ended 2024 of $199.5 million and $3.41 per diluted common share, respectively, compared to $221.9 million and $3.73 per diluted common share, respectively, for the year ended 2023.
When adjusting for certain non-recurring items, 2024 adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $203.3 million and adjusted diluted earnings per common share totaled $3.47, compared to 2023 $236.7 million and $3.98, respectively.  These adjusted net income and earnings per share amounts are non-GAAP measures.  For reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, see “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” within the “Results of Operations” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
As of December 31, 2024, total assets equaled $18.3 billion, a decrease of $93.9 million or 0.5 percent from December 31, 2023.  
Cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits decreased from December 31, 2023 by $162.2 million. Total investment securities decreased $350.7 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to the sales of $268.5 million of investment securities during the year ended December 31, 2024.  Scheduled paydowns and maturities and unrealized losses in available for sale securities decreased investment securities by $147.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively, which was offset by $94.7 million in purchases of CRA eligible securities.  The investment portfolio as a percentage of total assets was 18.9 percent at December 31, 2024 compared to 20.7 percent at December 31, 2023.  During 2024, the Corporation repositioned the investment securities portfolio with a primary focus of using liquidity generated from sales of securities to fund loan growth, the sale of deposits to Old Second National Bank and reinvestment in higher-yielding assets.  Additional details of the changes in the Corporation’s investment securities portfolio are discussed within NOTE 4. INVESTMENT SECURITIES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Corporation’s total loan portfolio grew $368.1 million or 2.9 percent since December 31, 2023. The composition of the loan portfolio is 75.0 percent commercial oriented with the largest loan classes of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate, non-owner occupied, representing 31.9 percent and 17.7 percent of the total loan portfolio, respectively.  The increase was primarily driven by an increase in commercial and industrial, public finance and other commercial loans, and residential real estate loans. Partially offsetting those increases was a decrease in construction and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans.  Additional details of the changes in the Corporation’s loan portfolio are discussed within NOTE 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the “LOAN QUALITY AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The Corporation’s allowance for credit losses - loans (“ACL - loans”) totaled $192.8 million as of December 31, 2024 and equaled 1.50 percent  of total loans, compared to $204.9 million and 1.64 percent of total loans at December 31, 2023.  During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Corporation recognized $49.4 million of net charge-offs, or 39 basis points of average loans, compared to net charge-offs of $25.6 million, or 21 basis points of average loans, for the year ended December 31, 2023.  The increase in net charge-offs is primarily related to two commercial and industrial relationships that accounted for $42.7 million of charge-offs during 2024. One borrower experienced a sudden change in revenue from the cancellation and inability to renegotiate their contracts with the U.S. Government. This negatively impacted the value of the borrower's business and resulted in their inability to repay principal and interest. The second borrower provided notification of its plans to cease operations, which resulted in their inability to repay principal and interest and a charge-off for the Corporation.  The Corporation recorded $35.7 million of provision for credit losses during 2024 compared to $3.5 million during 2023.  The increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily driven by the increase in net charge-offs described above. Nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2024 totaled $73.8 million, an increase of $20.2 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to a $24.1 million increase in non-accrual balances within the construction loan class.  The increase was offset by a $3.6 million decrease in non-accrual balances within the residential loan class.   The coverage ratio of ACL - Loans to nonaccrual loans is 261.3 percent at December 31, 2024.  Additional details of the Corporation’s allowance methodology and asset quality are discussed within  NOTE 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and within the “LOAN QUALITY AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

PART II: ITEM 7. AND ITEM 7A. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Corporation’s premises and equipment decreased $4.2 million from December 31, 2023 primarily due to the sale of five Illinois branches. Additional details of the Corporation’s divestiture of assets related to the Old Second National Bank branch sale is discussed within NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.  
The Corporation’s tax asset, deferred and receivable decreased from $99.9 million at December 31, 2023 to $92.4 million at December 31, 2024.  The $7.5 million decrease was a combination of the Corporation’s net deferred tax asset increasing from $84.7 million at December 31, 2023 to $85.9 million at December 31, 2024, and the income tax receivable decreasing from $15.2 million at December 31, 2023 to $6.5 million at December 31, 2024.
The Corporation’s other assets increased $64.8 million from December 31, 2023.  The Corporation’s continual investment in community redevelopment funds resulted in an increase of $57.0 million when compared to December 31, 2023.  Additionally, the prepaid pension asset at December 31, 2024 increased by $4.0 million compared to the same period in 2023.  Additional details of the Corporation’s investments in community redevelopment funds and pension plan are discussed in NOTE 9. QUALIFIED AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS and NOTE 18. PENSION AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Deposits decreased $299.8 million from December 31, 2023.  The decrease in deposits was primarily driven by the sale of $267.4 million of deposits related to the Illinois branch sale that closed in the fourth quarter of 2024. Total deposits excluding time deposits greater than $100,000 represented 92.8 percent of the deposit portfolio at December 31, 2024.  Noninterest bearing deposits represents 16.0 percent of the deposit portfolio, down slightly from 16.9 percent as of December 31, 2023.  The decline is the result of a mix shift occurring across the industry as clients move into higher yielding deposit products.  
The average account balance within the deposit portfolio was $35,000 at December 31, 2024.  Insured deposits totaled 70.6 percent of total deposits, with the State of Indiana’s Public Deposit Insurance Fund, which insures certain public deposits, providing insurance to 14.0 percent of deposits and the FDIC providing insurance to the remaining 56.6 percent.  Only 29.4 percent of deposits are uninsured and our available liquidity is ample to cover those when considering both on balance sheet sources of liquidity and unused capacity from the Federal Reserve Discount Window, FHLB and unsecured borrowing sources.
Total borrowings increased $129.4 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023.  Federal funds purchased and Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased $99.2 million and $109.7 million, respectively, compared to December 31, 2023 as the Corporation utilized borrowings to fund loan growth and supplement deposit balances in 2024.  Offsetting these increases was a $65.1 million decrease in subordinated debt and other borrowings due to the Corporation exercising its rights to redeem $65.0 million in principal of subordinated debt in 2024.   Additional details of the Corporation’s borrowings are discussed within NOTE 11.  BORROWINGS of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Corporation’s other liabilities as of December 31, 2024 increased $22.0 million from the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in unfunded commitments related to the Corporation’s LIHTC partnerships which totaled $35.8 million.  
The Corporation continued to maintain all regulatory capital ratios in excess of the regulatory definition of “well-capitalized.”  Details of the regulatory capital ratios are discussed within the “CAPITAL” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2023
The Corporation reported net income available to common stockholders and diluted earnings per common share for the year ended 2023 of $221.9 million and $3.73 per diluted common share, respectively, compared to $220.7 million and $3.81 per diluted common share, respectively, for the year ended 2022.
Adjusted net income available to common stockholders for the year ended 2023, adjusting for certain non-recurring items, was $236.7 million and adjusted diluted earnings per common share totaled $3.98, compared to $242.5 million and $4.19, respectively, for the year ended 2022.  These adjusted net income and earnings per share amounts are non-GAAP measures.  For reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, see “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” within the “Results of Operations” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
As of December 31, 2023, total assets equaled  $18.4 billion, an increase of $403.7 million, or 2.2 percent, from December 31, 2022.  
Cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits decreased from December 31, 2022 by $300.1 million, primarily due to deposit growth and proceeds from investment securities principal and interest cashflows in addition to sales, which were held in cash for liquidity purposes.  Total investment securities decreased $452.4 million from December 31, 2022, primarily due to the sales of $395.2 million of investment securities during the year ended December 31, 2023.  Scheduled paydowns and maturities decreased investment securities by $161.2 million, which was offset by a decrease of $77.0 million in unrealized losses in the available for sale portfolio during 2023.  During 2023 the Corporation used cashflows from the investment portfolio to fund loan growth and pay down borrowings.  The investment portfolio as a percentage of total assets was 20.8 percent at December 31, 2023 compared to 23.8 percent at December 31, 2022.  This decrease reflected progress towards a more normalized earning asset mix.  Additional details of the changes in the Corporation’s investment securities portfolio are discussed within NOTE 4. INVESTMENT SECURITIES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
37
PART II: ITEM 7. AND ITEM 7A. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Corporation’s total loan portfolio grew $492.0 million or 4.1 percent since December 31, 2022. The loan classes that experienced the largest increases from December 31, 2022 were in commercial and industrial, residential real estate, and construction real estate loans.  The loan classes that experienced the largest decreases from December 31, 2022 were in owner occupied commercial real estate and home equity loans. Additional details of the changes in the Corporation’s loan portfolio are discussed within NOTE 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the “LOAN QUALITY AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The Corporation’s allowance for credit losses - loans totaled $204.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and equaled 1.64 percent of total loans, compared to $223.3 million and 1.86 percent of total loans at December 31, 2022.  During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Corporation recognized $25.6 million of net charge-offs, compared to net charge-offs of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.  The increase in net charge-offs is primarily related to a charge-off of a previously reported nonaccrual loan to a syndicated specialty finance company resulting from alleged fraud that impacted our borrower’s ability to repay.  The effect of the charge-offs on the ACL - loans was offset by provision expense on loans of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.  Reserves for unfunded commitments were reduced by $3.8 million, resulting in a net provision expense of $3.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2023 totaled $53.6 million, an increase of $11.3 million from December 31, 2022.  The coverage ratio of ACL - Loans to nonaccrual loans is 382.5 percent at December 31, 2023.  Additional details of the Corporation’s allowance methodology and asset quality are discussed within  NOTE 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and within the “LOAN QUALITY AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The Corporation’s premises and equipment increased $16.8 million from December 31, 2022 primarily due to the $15.9 million purchase of an Indianapolis regional headquarters building in the third quarter of 2023.
The Corporation’s tax asset, deferred and receivable decreased from $111.2 million at December 31, 2022 to $99.9 million at December 31, 2023.  The primary drivers of the decrease from December 31, 2022, were declines in the deferred tax asset for unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities and the deferred tax asset related to loan losses, of $16.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively.  These declines were offset by an increase of $16.5 million in the income tax refundable when compared to December 31, 2022.
The Corporation’s other assets increased $36.8 million from December 31, 2022.  The Corporation’s continual investment in community redevelopment funds resulted in an increase of $37.8 million when compared to December 31, 2022.  Additionally, the prepaid pension asset at December 31, 2023 increased by $4.1 million compared to the same period in 2022.  Additional details of the Corporation’s investments in community redevelopment funds and pension plan are discussed in NOTE 9. QUALIFIED AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS and NOTE 18. PENSION AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Corporation’s derivative assets (recorded in other assets) and derivative liabilities (recorded in other liabilities) decreased $13.7 million and $13.8 million, respectively, from December 31, 2022.  The decreases in valuations from December 31, 2022 were primarily driven by forward interest rate fluctuations, existing trades getting closer to maturity, terminations and maturities of existing trades which were partially offset by new production in 2023. 
Deposits increased $438.7 million from December 31, 2022.  Total deposits less time deposits greater than $100,000, or core deposits, represented 90.5 percent of the deposit portfolio at December 31, 2023.  Noninterest bearing deposits represented 16.9 percent of the deposit portfolio, which is a decline from December 31, 2022 of 22.1 percent.  The decline is the result of a mix shift which occurred across the industry as clients moved into higher yielding deposit products.  The Corporation experienced increases from December 31, 2022 in certificates and other time deposits of $100,000 or more of $666.4 million, other certificates and time deposits of $381.2 million and brokered certificates of deposit of $14.7 million.  Demand and savings accounts decreased from December 31, 2022 by $482.9 million and $140.7 million, respectively.
The average account within the deposit portfolio totaled only $34,000.  Insured deposits totaled 72.1 percent of total deposits, with the State of Indiana’s Public Deposit Insurance Fund, which insures certain public deposits, providing insurance to 15.1 percent of deposits and the FDIC providing insurance to the remaining 57.0 percent.  Only 27.9 percent of deposits were uninsured and our available liquidity was ample to cover those when considering both on balance sheet sources of liquidity and unused capacity from the Federal Reserve Discount Window, FHLB and unsecured borrowing sources.
Total borrowings decreased $285.2 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022.  Federal funds purchased and Federal Home Loan Bank advances decreased $171.6 million and $110.8 million, respectively, compared to December 31, 2022 as the Corporation utilized liquidity sources to pay down borrowings in 2023.  Additionally, there was a decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements of $10.1 million when compared to December 31, 2022.  Slightly offsetting these decreases was a $7.3 million increase in subordinated debt and other borrowings due to a secured borrowing acquired in conjunction with the purchase of the Indianapolis regional headquarters building.   Additional details of the Corporation’s borrowings are discussed within NOTE 11.  BORROWINGS of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Corporation’s other liabilities as of December 31, 2023 increased $25.8 million from the same period in 2022, primarily due to an increase in unfunded commitments related to the Corporation’s LIHTC partnerships $32.5 million.  The increase in other liabilities was offset by a decrease in the derivative liability of $13.8 million, as noted in the other assets section above.
The Corporation continued to maintain all regulatory capital ratios in excess of the regulatory definition of “well-capitalized.”  Details of the regulatory capital ratios are discussed within the “CAPITAL” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Corporation’s accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and general practices within the banking industry.  As a supplement to GAAP, the Corporation provides non-GAAP performance measures, which management believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the Corporation’s performance.  Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited.  Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the following tables.
Adjusted earnings per share, excluding PPP loan income, net realized gains/losses on the sales of available for sale securities, acquisition-related expenses and non-core expenses, are meaningful non-GAAP financial measures for management, as they provide a meaningful foundation for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will aid both investors and analysts in analyzing our financial measures and predicting future performance.  These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of the Corporation’s business, because management does not consider these items to be relevant to ongoing financial performance on a per share basis. 
Non-GAAP financial measures such as tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible earnings per share, return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible equity are important measures of the strength of the Corporation’s capital and ability to generate earnings on tangible common equity invested by our shareholders.  These non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information and may assist investors in analyzing the Corporation’s financial position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock, but do retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive gains (losses) in shareholder’s equity.  Disclosure of these measures also allows analysts and banking regulators to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases.

NET INTEREST INCOME
Net interest income is the most significant component of the Corporation’s earnings, comprising 80.6 percent of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.  Net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors, primarily the volume and mix of earning assets, funding sources, and interest rate fluctuations.  Other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans, prepayment risk on loan and investment-related assets, and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  Loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities.  Funding from customer deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources.  Factors such as general economic activity, Federal Reserve Board monetary policy, and price volatility of competing alternative investments, can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize the mix of assets and funding and the net interest income and margin.
Net interest income is the excess of interest received from earning assets over interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.  For analytical purposes, net interest income is also presented on an FTE basis in the tables that follow to reflect what our tax-exempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same after-tax yield as a taxable asset.  The federal statutory rate of 21 percent was used for 2024, 2023, and 2022.   
40
PART II: ITEM 7. AND ITEM 7A. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The FTE analysis portrays the income tax benefits associated with tax-exempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and tax-exempt assets.  Management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis.  Therefore, management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons. 
Net interest margin, on an FTE basis, decreased 16 basis points to 3.19 percent for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 3.35 percent for the same period in 2023.
Average Balance Sheet
Average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $62.5 million compared to the same period in 2023.  The increase for the year ended December 31, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023 was driven by a $336.4 million increase in average loans as a result of organic loan growth primarily within the commercial and residential real estate loan portfolios, the average balances of which increased $167.9 million and $123.3 million, respectively.  The increase in average loans was partially offset by a $260.9 million decrease in average investment securities as the Corporation repositioned the securities portfolio by selling $268.5 million of lower-yielding securities.
Average total deposits increased $95.1 million, or 0.6 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.  The increase was due to a $508.1 million, or 4.3 percent, increase in average interest-bearing deposits partially offset by a $413.0 million, or 14.8 percent, decrease in average noninterest-bearing deposits.  The increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits was driven by certificates and other time deposits, money market deposits and interest-bearing deposits, which increased $490.6 million, $177.2 million and $70.8 million, respectively but was partially offset by a $230.5 million decrease in the average balance of savings deposits.  The decrease in the average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits reflects clients moving funds from noninterest-bearing accounts into interest-bearing deposit products.  
Average borrowings decreased $106.5 million, or 9.6 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by decreases of $53.8 million, $35.3 million and $18.2 million in the average balance of subordinated debt, repurchase agreements and fed funds purchased, respectively. The Corporation redeemed $65.0 million of subordinated debt in the first half of 2024 which contributed to the decrease in the average balance of subordinated debt. The decreases in repurchase agreements and fed funds purchased were due primarily to the Corporation utilizing liquidity to pay down borrowings in 2024. 
Interest Income/Expense and Average Yields
FTE net interest income decreased $24.9 million, or 4.4 percent, during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. FTE interest income increased $58.7 million, or 7.5 percent, compared to the same period in 2023 but was more than offset by a $78.4 million, or 22.5 percent increase in total interest expense.  The increase in FTE interest income was primarily due to a shift in the earning asset mix from securities to loans as well as a 29 basis point increase in the yield earned on earning assets. Most notably, the yield earned on loans increased 29 basis points in 2024 compared to 2023.
The increase in total interest expense was primarily due to an $80.0 million, or 26.1 percent, increase in interest-bearing deposits coupled with a 54 basis point increase in the rate paid on those deposits.  Interest costs increased during 2024 due to continued deposit pricing pressure and deposit portfolio mix changes due to customers migrating from noninterest-bearing deposit products into interest-bearing deposit products.

PART II: ITEM 7. AND ITEM 7A. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NONINTEREST INCOME
Noninterest income totaled $125.6 million in 2024, an increase of $20.0 million, or 18.9 percent, from 2023.  The Corporation recorded a $20.0 million gain on the Illinois branch sale during the fourth quarter of 2024.  This was partially offset by a $13.8 million increase in net realized losses on sales of available for sale securities.  Additionally, the Corporation realized higher gains on the sales of mortgage loans and increased private wealth fees of $5.2 million and a $3.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.  Other income increased $3.6 million primarily related to an increase in the valuation of CRA fund investments for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023. 
Noninterest income totaled $105.6 million in 2023, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 2.2 percent, from 2022.  The decrease was primarily due to $6.9 million in net losses realized on the sale of $395.2 million of available for sale securities during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $1.2 million in net realized gains during the year ended December 31, 2022.  Additionally, gains on life insurance benefits decreased $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022.  Offsetting these declines was an increase of $5.6 million in net gains and fees on sales of mortgage loans.  Service charges on deposit accounts increased $2.5 million from 2022, primarily due to the Level One acquisition in the second quarter of 2022. 
NONINTEREST EXPENSES
Noninterest expense totaled $379.3 million in 2024, a decrease of $9.0 million, or 2.3 percent from 2023. The largest decrease of $7.6 million was in salaries and employee benefits which resulted primarily from $6.3 million in charges in 2023 related to early retirement and severance costs. Other notable decreases include professional and other outside services of $1.6 million, net occupancy of $1.5 million, intangible asset amortization of $1.5 million and other real estate owned and foreclosure expenses of $1.2 million. These decreases were offset by a $2.7 million increase in equipment expense and a $2.0 million increase in outside data processing expenses as the Corporation continued to invest in customer facing digital solutions throughout 2024.
Noninterest expense totaled $388.3 million in 2023, an increase of $32.6 million, or 9.2 percent from 2022.  The largest increase of $21.9 million was in salaries and employee benefits which resulted primarily from the addition of Level One staff for the full year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to only nine months of 2022, and charges of $6.3 million from employee early retirement and severance costs during the fourth quarter of 2023.  In addition, occupancy and equipment expenses in 2023 increased by $3.8 million from 2022 as a result of the larger franchise footprint, and a $2.1 million expense from a lease termination during the fourth quarter.  The Corporation continues to invest in customer-facing digital solutions that contributed to increases in outside data processing expenses of $3.5 million.  FDIC assessments increased $4.4 million in 2023 from 2022 due to an FDIC special assessment of $4.3 million.  The increase in other real estate and foreclosure expenses of $2.5 million, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, was the result of higher property value write-downs, higher forced-placed insurance expenses, and less credit-related expense recoveries.  The increase in other expenses is primarily due to higher customer-related contingent losses during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.  These increases were offset by a $5.5 million decrease in professional and other outside services due primarily to $7.1 million of transaction costs related to the Level One acquisition that were recorded in 2022.  
INCOME TAXES
The Corporation’s federal statutory income tax rate for 2024 is 21 percent and its state tax rate varies from 0 to 9.5 percent depending on the state in which the subsidiary company operates.  The Corporation’s effective tax rate, which was 13.1 percent in 2024 and 13.7 percent in 2023, is lower than the blended effective statutory federal and state rates primarily due to the Corporation’s income on tax-exempt securities and loans, income generated by the subsidiaries operating in a state with no state or local income tax, income tax credits generated from investments in affordable housing projects, and tax-exempt earnings from bank-owned life insurance contracts. 
Income tax expense in 2024 was $30.3 million on pre-tax income of $231.7 million, or 13.1 percent.  For 2023, income tax expense was $35.4 million on pre-tax income of $259.2 million, or 13.7 percent.  The lower effective income tax rate in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in income tax credits generated from investments in affordable housing projects.  The detailed reconciliation of federal statutory to actual tax expense is shown in NOTE 19. INCOME TAX of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Corporation’s tax asset, deferred and receivable decreased from $99.9 million at December 31, 2023 to $92.4 million at December 31, 2024.  The $7.5 million decrease was a combination of the Corporation’s net deferred tax asset increasing from $84.7 million at December 31, 2023 to $85.9 million at December 31, 2024, and the income tax receivable decreasing from $15.2 million at December 31, 2023 to $6.5 million at December 31, 2024.
CAPITAL
Preferred Stock
As part of the Level One acquisition, the Corporation issued 10,000 shares of newly created 7.5 percent non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $2,500 per share, in exchange for the outstanding Level One Series B preferred stock, and as part of that exchange, each outstanding Level One depositary share representing a 1/100th interest in a share of the Level One preferred stock was converted into a depositary share of the Corporation representing a 1/100th interest in a share of its newly issued preferred stock.  The Corporation had $25.0 million of outstanding preferred stock at December 31, 2024 and 2023.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the Corporation declared and paid dividends of $187.52 per share (equivalent to $1.88 per depositary share), equal to $1.9 million.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Corporation declared and paid dividends of $187.52 per share (equivalent to $1.88 per depositary share), equal to $1.9 million.  The Series A preferred stock qualifies as tier 1 capital for purposes of the regulatory capital calculations.

Stock Repurchase Program
On January 27, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Corporation approved a stock repurchase program of up to 3,333,000 shares of the Corporation’s outstanding common stock; provided, however, that the total aggregate investment in shares repurchased under the program may not exceed $100,000,000.  On a share basis, the amount of common stock subject to the repurchase program represented approximately 6 percent of the Corporation’s outstanding shares at the time the program became effective.  The Corporation repurchased 1,648,466 shares of its common stock pursuant to the repurchase program during 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Corporation had approximately 1.0 million shares at an aggregate value of $18.4 million available to repurchase under the program. The Corporation did not repurchase any shares of its common stock pursuant to the repurchase program during 2022 or 2023.  
In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was enacted. Among other things, the IRA imposes a new 1 percent excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased after December 31, 2022 by publicly traded U.S. corporations (like the Corporation). With certain exceptions, the value of stock repurchased is determined net of stock issued in the year, including shares issued pursuant to compensatory arrangements. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the Corporation recorded excise tax of $0.5 million, related to its share repurchase during the period, which is reflected in Stockholders’ Equity as a component of additional paid-in capital. 
Regulatory Capital

Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance.  The Corporation and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies and are assigned to a capital category.  The assigned capital category is largely determined by four ratios that are calculated according to the regulations: total risk-based capital, tier 1 risk-based capital, common equity tier 1 ("CET1"), and tier 1 leverage ratios.  The ratios are intended to measure capital relative to assets and credit risk associated with those assets and off-balance sheet exposures of the entity.  The capital category assigned to an entity can also be affected by qualitative judgments made by regulatory agencies about the risk inherent in the entity’s activities that are not part of the calculated ratios.
There are five capital categories defined in the regulations, ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized.  Classification of a bank in any of the undercapitalized categories can result in actions by regulators that could have a material effect on a bank's operations. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total risk-based capital, tier 1 capital, and common equity tier 1 capital, in each case, to risk-weighted assets, and of tier 1 capital to average assets, or leverage ratio, all of which are calculated as defined in the regulations.  Banks with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, depending on their actual levels.  The appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade a bank to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the bank is in an unsafe or unsound practice.  Banks are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis for a change in capital category.
Basel III requires the Corporation and the Bank to maintain the minimum capital and leverage ratios as defined in the regulation and as illustrated in the table below, which capital to risk-weighted asset ratios include a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer.  Under Basel III, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends, the Corporation must hold a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized CET1 to risk-weighted assets ratio (which buffer is reflected in the required ratios below).  Under Basel III, the Corporation and Bank elected to opt-out of including accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital.  As of December 31, 2024, the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to be considered well capitalized under the fully phased-in Basel III capital rules.  There is no threshold for well capitalized status for bank holding companies.  
As part of a March 27, 2020 joint statement of federal banking regulators, an interim final rule that allowed banking organizations to mitigate the effects of the CECL accounting standard on their regulatory capital was announced. Banking organizations could elect to mitigate the estimated cumulative regulatory capital effects of CECL for up to two years. This two-year delay was to be in addition to the three-year transition period that federal banking regulators had already made available. While the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 provided for a further extension of the mandatory adoption of CECL until January 1, 2022, the federal banking regulators elected to not provide a similar extension to the two year mitigation period applicable to regulatory capital effects.  Instead, the federal banking regulators require that, in order to utilize the additional two-year delay, banking organizations must have adopted the CECL standard no later than December 31, 2020, as required by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act. As a result, because implementation of the CECL standard was delayed by the Corporation until January 1, 2021, it began phasing in the cumulative effect of the adoption on its regulatory capital, at a rate of 25 percent per year, over a three-year transition period that began on January 1, 2021. Under that phase-in schedule, the cumulative effect of the adoption was fully reflected in regulatory capital on January 1, 2024.

On November 1, 2013, the Corporation completed the private issuance and sale to four institutional investors of an aggregate of $70.0 million of debt comprised of (a) 5.00 percent Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2028 in the aggregate principal amount of $5 million  and (b) 6.75 percent Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due October 30, 2028 in the aggregate principal amount of $65.0 million.  The Corporation exercised its right to redeem $65 million of the subordinated debt on the scheduled interest payment date during the first half of 2024.  
On April 1, 2022, the Corporation assumed $30.0 million of subordinated notes in conjunction with its acquisition of Level One.  The notes mature on December 18, 2029, and the Corporation has the option to redeem any or all of the subordinated notes without premium or penalty any time after December 18, 2024 or upon the occurrence of a tier 2 capital event or tax event.  As of December 31, 2024, these subordinated debentures were classified as tier 2 capital and were subject to the five year phase-out. 
Management believes the disclosed capital ratios are meaningful measurements for evaluating the safety and soundness of the Corporation. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations.  The Federal Reserve focuses its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 capital known as CET1.  Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common stockholders’ equity (essentially tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock and non-controlling interest in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on CET1 is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories.  Tier I regulatory capital consists primarily of total common stockholders’ equity and subordinated debentures issued to business trusts categorized as qualifying borrowings, less non-qualifying intangible assets and unrealized net securities gains or losses.

In management’s view, certain non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and ratios, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance.  We believe investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures and ratios in assessing our operating results and related trends, and when forecasting future periods.  However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures and ratios presented in accordance with GAAP.
The Corporation’s tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that are meaningful to the Corporation, as well as analysts and investors, in assessing the Corporation’s use of equity and in facilitating period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons.  Tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.81 percent at December 31, 2024, and 8.40 percent at December 31, 2023. The increase in the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was primarily due to tangible common equity increasing $64.5 million, or 4.4 percent, while tangible assets decreased $86.6 million, or 0.5 percent, from 2023.  The growth in tangible common equity was primarily due to 2024 net income earned of $201.4 million partially offset by dividends declared of $83.5 million and common stock repurchases totaling $56.2 million.  The decline in tangible assets was mostly attributable to a $350.7 million decrease in the balance of investment securities and a $162.2 million decrease in total cash balances partially offset by a $368.1 million increase in loans and a $64.8 million increase in other assets. 
Non-GAAP financial measures such as tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible earnings per share, return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible equity are important measures of the strength of the Corporation's capital and ability to generate earnings on tangible common equity invested by our shareholders.  These non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information and may assist investors in analyzing the Corporation’s financial position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock, but retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive losses in stockholders’ equity.  Disclosure of these measures also allows analysts and banking regulators to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases.
The tables within the “NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reconcile traditional GAAP measures to these non-GAAP financial measures at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

PART II: ITEM 7. AND ITEM 7A. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
LOAN QUALITY AND PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS 
The Corporation’s primary lending focus is small business and middle market commercial, commercial real estate, public finance and residential real estate, which results in portfolio diversification.  Commercial loans are individually underwritten and judgmentally risk rated.  They are periodically monitored and prompt corrective actions are taken on deteriorating loans.  Consumer loans are typically underwritten with statistical decision-making tools and are managed throughout their life cycle on a portfolio basis.
Loan Quality 
The quality of the loan portfolio and the amount of nonperforming loans may increase or decrease as a result of acquisitions, organic portfolio growth, problem loan recognition and resolution through collections, sales or charge-offs.  The performance of any loan can be affected by external factors such as economic conditions, or internal factors specific to a particular borrower, such as the actions of a customer’s internal management.
At December 31, 2024, non-accrual loans totaled $73.8 million, an increase of $20.2 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to a $24.1 million increase in non-accrual balances within the construction loan class.  The increase was offset by a $3.6 million decrease in non-accrual balances within the residential loan class. 
At December 31, 2024, loans 90-days or more delinquent and still accruing totaled $5.9 million, an increase of $5.7 million from December 31, 2023.  The increase was primarily driven by two loans totaling $5.3 million, including $3.7 million and $1.6 million within the construction and commercial and industrial loan classes, respectively. 
According to applicable accounting guidance, loans that no longer exhibit similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually to determine if there is a need for a specific reserve.  Commercial loans under $500,000 and consumer loans are not individually evaluated.  The determination for individual evaluation is made based on current information or events that may suggest it is probable that not all amounts due of principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, will be substantially collected.
The Corporation’s nonperforming assets plus accruing loans 90 days or more delinquent and individually evaluated loans are presented in the table below.

PROVISION EXPENSE AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS    
The CECL model requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost based on historical experiences, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  CECL also requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization's portfolio.  Additional details of the Corporation's CECL methodology and allowance calculation are discussed within NOTE 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The CECL allowance is maintained through the provision for credit losses - loans, which is a charge against earnings.  Based on management’s judgment as to the appropriate level of the ACL - Loans, the amount provided in any period may be greater or less than net loan losses for the same period.  The determination of the provision amount and the adequacy of the allowance in any period is based on management’s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio.

PART II: ITEM 7. AND ITEM 7A. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Corporation’s total loan balance, excluding loans held for sale, increased $368.3 million, ending December 31, 2024 at $12.9 billion. At December 31, 2024, the ACL - Loans totaled $192.8 million, which represents a decrease of $12.2 million from December 31, 2023.  The allowance decreased primarily due to $49.4 million of net charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2024.  As a percentage of loans, the ACL - Loans was 1.50 percent at December 31, 2024, compared to 1.64 percent at December 31, 2023 and 1.86 percent at December 31, 2022.  The Corporation deems the current estimate for loan portfolio credit exposure as appropriate.

In 2024, the Corporation recorded $37.2 million in provision for credit losses - loans, which was offset by a release in reserve of $1.5 million related to the allowance for unfunded commitments, resulting in a net provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 of $35.7 million.  In 2023, the Corporation recorded a $7.3 million provision for credit losses - loans, which was offset by a release in reserve of $3.8 million related to the allowance for unfunded commitments, resulting in a net provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 of $3.5 million. 
Net charge-offs totaling $49.4 million, $25.6 million, and $2.7 million were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily related to two commercial relationships that accounted for $42.7 million of charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2024. One borrower experienced a sudden change in revenue from the cancellation and inability to renegotiate their contracts with the U.S. Government. This negatively impacted the value of the borrower’s business and resulted in their inability to repay principal and interest. The second borrower provided notification of its plans to cease operations, which resulted in their inability to repay principal and interest and a charge-off for the Corporation. The Corporation does not believe these charge-offs are indicative of the portfolio as a whole. The distribution of the net charge-offs (recoveries) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 are reflected in the following table.

Management continually evaluates the commercial loan portfolio by including consideration of specific borrower cash flow analysis and estimated collateral values, types and amounts on nonperforming loans, past and anticipated credit loss experience, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, and the current condition and amount of loans outstanding.  The determination of the provision for credit losses in any period is based on management’s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio, and its judgment as to the impact of current economic conditions on the portfolio.  The Corporation continues to monitor economic forecast changes, loan growth and credit quality to determine provision needs in the future.
GOODWILL
During the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2023, the Corporation performed its annual goodwill impairment testing and the fair value exceeded the Corporation’s carrying value. Based on the analysis performed, the Corporation concluded goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

PART II: ITEM 7. AND ITEM 7A. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
LIQUIDITY
Liquidity management is the process by which the Corporation ensures that adequate liquid funds are available for the holding company and its subsidiaries.  These funds are necessary in order to meet financial commitments on a timely basis.  These commitments include withdrawals by depositors, funding credit obligations to borrowers, paying dividends to stockholders, paying operating expenses, funding capital expenditures, and maintaining deposit reserve requirements.  Liquidity is monitored and closely managed by the asset/liability committee.

The Corporation’s liquidity is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is subject to certain regulatory limitations and access to other funding sources.  Liquidity of the Bank is derived primarily from core deposit growth, principal payments received on loans, the sale and maturity of investment securities, net cash provided by operating activities, and access to other funding sources.
The principal source of asset-funded liquidity is investment securities classified as available for sale, the market values of which totaled $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $240.6 million, or 14.8 percent, from December 31, 2023.  Securities classified as held to maturity that are maturing within a short period of time can also be a source of liquidity.  Securities classified as held to maturity and that are maturing in one year or less totaled $5.3 million at December 31, 2024.  In addition, other types of assets such as cash and interest-bearing deposits with other banks, federal funds sold and loans maturing within one year are sources of liquidity.
The most stable source of liability-funded liquidity for both the long-term and short-term is deposit growth and retention in the core deposit base.  Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are also considered a source of liquidity.  In addition, FHLB advances and Federal Reserve Discount Window borrowings are utilized as a funding source.  At December 31, 2024, total borrowings from the FHLB were $822.6 million and there was $10,000 of outstanding borrowings from the Federal Reserve Discount Window.  The Bank has pledged certain mortgage loans and investments to the FHLB and Federal Reserve.  The total available remaining borrowing capacity from the FHLB and Federal Reserve at December 31, 2024 was $733.1 million and $2.5 billion, respectively.

Also, in the normal course of business, the Bank is a party to a number of other off-balance sheet activities that contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements.  These activities primarily consist of traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments such as loan commitments and standby letters of credit.
Summarized credit-related financial instruments at December 31, 2024 are as follows:

INTEREST SENSITIVITY AND DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Asset/Liability management has been an important factor in the Corporation’s ability to record consistent earnings growth through periods of interest rate volatility and product deregulation. Management and the Board of Directors monitor the Corporation’s liquidity and interest sensitivity positions at regular meetings to review how changes in interest rates may affect earnings.  Decisions regarding investment and the pricing of loan and deposit products are made after analysis of reports designed to measure liquidity, rate sensitivity, the Corporation’s exposure to changes in net interest income given various rate scenarios and the economic and competitive environments.
It is the objective of the Corporation to monitor and manage risk exposure to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates.  It is the goal of the Corporation’s Asset/Liability management function to provide optimum and stable net interest income. To accomplish this, management uses two asset liability tools.  GAP/Interest Rate Sensitivity Reports and Net Interest Income Simulation Modeling are constructed, presented and monitored quarterly.  Management believes that the Corporation’s liquidity and interest sensitivity position at December 31, 2024, remained adequate to meet the Corporation’s primary goal of achieving optimum interest margins while avoiding undue interest rate risk.

The Corporation had a cumulative negative gap of $3.9 billion in the one-year horizon at December 31, 2024, or 21.2 percent of total assets. 
Net interest income simulation modeling, or earnings-at-risk, measures the sensitivity of net interest income to various interest rate movements. The Corporation’s asset liability process monitors simulated net interest income under three separate interest rate scenarios; base, rising and falling.  Estimated net interest income for each scenario is calculated over a twelve-month horizon.  The immediate and parallel changes to the base case scenario used in the model are presented below.  The interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management’s view of future market movements.  Rather, these are intended to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may introduce into the earnings of the Corporation.
The base scenario is highly dependent on numerous assumptions embedded in the model, including assumptions related to future interest rates. While the base sensitivity analysis incorporates management’s best estimate of interest rate and balance sheet dynamics under various market rate movements, the actual behavior and resulting earnings impact will likely differ from that projected.  For certain assets, the base simulation model captures the expected prepayment behavior under changing interest rate environments.  Assumptions and methodologies regarding the interest rate or balance behavior of indeterminate maturity products, such as savings, money market, interest-bearing and demand deposits, reflect management’s best estimate of expected future behavior.  Historical retention rate assumptions are applied to nonmaturity deposits for modeling purposes.
The comparative rising 200 and 100 basis points and falling 200 and 100 basis points scenarios below, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, assume further interest rate changes in addition to the base simulation discussed above.  These changes are immediate and parallel changes to the base case scenario. 
Results for rising 200 and 100 basis points and falling 200 and 100 basis points interest rate scenarios are listed below based upon the Corporation’s rate sensitive assets and liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023.  The change from the base case represents cumulative net interest income over a twelve-month time horizon.  Balance sheet assumptions used for the base scenario are the same for the rising and falling simulations.

Deposits decreased $299.8 million from December 31, 2023.  The majority of the decrease was due to the sale of the Illinois branch deposits of $267.4 million.  In addition to the overall balance decline resulting from the Illinois branch sale, as interest rates declined in the second half of 2024, customers began migrating funds from maturity time deposit products into nonmaturity deposit products. 
Federal funds purchased increased $99.2 million, and securities sold under repurchase agreements decreased $14.4 million from December 31, 2023, respectively.  The Corporation utilized the funds due to increased loan growth during the year ended December 31, 2024.  Further discussion regarding federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements is included in NOTE 11. BORROWINGS of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased $109.7 million compared to December 31, 2023 as the Corporation utilized FHLB advances in order to fund loan growth and supplement deposit balances in 2024.  Further discussion regarding FHLB advances is included in NOTE 11. BORROWINGS of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading “LIQUIDITY”.  Additionally, the interest rate risk is included as part of the Corporation’s interest simulation discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading “INTEREST SENSITIVITY AND DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK”.
Subordinated debentures and term loans decreased $65.1 million compared to December 31, 2023.  During the first half of 2024, the Corporation exercised its rights to redeem $65.0 million in principal of the US Bank Subordinated Debt Notes (“Subordinated Debt”) and paid the debt in full on the scheduled interest payment dates.   During the first quarter of 2025, the Corporation distributed notice of redemption of $30.0 million in principal amount. The redemption is permitted under the optional redemptions provisions of the Subordinated Notes and will occur in the first quarter of 2025 on the scheduled interest payment date.  Additional details regarding the subordinated debentures and other borrowings are discussed within NOTE 11.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders, Board of Directors and Audit Committee 
First Merchants Corporation
Muncie, Indiana
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of First Merchants Corporation (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Allowance for Credit Losses
As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation’s allowance for credit losses (ACL) on loans was $192.8 million at December 31, 2024. The ACL is an estimate of current expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The determination of the ACL requires significant judgment reflecting the Corporation’s best estimate of expected future losses for the loan’s entire contractual term adjusted for expected payments when appropriate.
We identified the econometric component of the ACL as a critical audit matter. The econometric component involves a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management’s estimates, such as evaluating management’s assessment of economic forecasts and conditions and other environmental factors used to adjust historical loss rates.
52
PART II: ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
•
Testing the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the econometric component of the ACL
•
Obtained an understanding of the Corporation’s process over the selection of reasonable and supportable forecasts
•
Testing clerical and computational accuracy of the formulas within the econometric component of the calculation.
•
Testing of completeness and accuracy of the information and reports utilized in the econometric component of the ACL, including reports used in management review controls over the econometric component of the ACL.
•
Evaluating the forecast adjustment, including assessing that it is reasonable and supportable

NOTE 1
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation and the Bank, conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and reporting practices followed by the banking industry.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses.

The Corporation is a financial holding company whose principal activity is the ownership and management of the Bank and operates in a single significant business segment.  The Bank provides full banking services under an Indiana state-charter.  Additionally, the Bank operates as First Merchants Private Wealth Advisors (a division of First Merchants Bank).  The Bank generates commercial, mortgage, and consumer loans and receives deposits from customers located primarily in central and northern Indiana, northeast Illinois, central Ohio and southeast Michigan counties.  The Bank’s loans are generally secured by specific items of collateral, including real property, consumer assets and business assets.
A brief description of current accounting practices and current valuation methodologies are presented below.
CONSOLIDATION
The consolidation of the Corporation’s financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation and all its subsidiaries, after elimination of all material intercompany transactions.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.  Under the acquisition method, assets and liabilities of the business acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition with any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired recorded as goodwill.  Results of operations of the acquired business are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.  Details of the Corporation’s acquisitions are included in NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash on hand, cash items in process of collection and noninterest bearing cash held at various banks are included in cash and cash equivalents and have a maturity of less than three months.  The Corporation maintains deposits with other financial institutions in amounts that exceed federal deposit insurance coverage.  Management regularly evaluates the credit risk associated with the counterparties to these transactions and believes there is not significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.
INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS
Interest-bearing cash held at other banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and federal funds sold are included in interest-bearing deposits and have a maturity of less than three months.  The Corporation maintains deposits with other financial institutions in amounts that exceed federal deposit insurance coverage.  Management regularly evaluates the credit risk associated with the counterparties to these transactions and believes there is not significant credit risk on interest-bearing deposits.
INVESTMENT SECURITIES
Held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost when the Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold them until maturity.  Available for sale securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis with the unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).  Realized gains and losses are recorded in earnings and the prior fair value adjustments are reclassified within stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses on sales of securities are determined on the specific-identification method.  Amortization of premiums are amortized to their earliest call date and accretion of discounts are amortized to the maturity date.  The amortization is recorded as interest income from securities.  Details of the Corporation’s investment securities portfolio are included in NOTE 4.  INVESTMENT SECURITIES of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE
For investment securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position, the Corporation first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.  If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income.  For investment securities available for sale that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Corporation evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors.  In making this assessment, the Corporation considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors.  If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security.  If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.  Unrealized losses that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).  Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the income statement as a component of the provision for credit loss.  The Corporation has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on investment securities available for sale from the estimate of credit losses. Investment securities available for sale are charged off against the allowance or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through the income statement when deemed uncollectible or when either of the aforementioned criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.  The Corporation did not record an allowance for credit losses on its investment securities available for sale as the unrealized losses were attributable to changes in interest rates, not credit quality.  Details of the Corporation’s allowance for credit losses on investment securities available for sale are included in NOTE 4.  INVESTMENT SECURITIES of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES HELD TO MATURITY (“ACL - INVESTMENTS”)
The ACL - Investments is a contra asset-valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of investment securities held to maturity to present the net amount expected to be collected.  Investment securities held to maturity are charged off against the ACL - Investments when deemed uncollectible.  Adjustments to the ACL - Investments are reported in the income statement as a component of the provision for credit loss.  The Corporation measures expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics, and considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The Corporation has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on investment securities held to maturity from the estimate of credit losses.  With regard to U.S. Government-sponsored agency and mortgage-backed securities, all these securities are issued by a U.S. government-sponsored entity and have an implicit or explicit government guarantee.  With regard to securities issued by states and municipalities and other investment securities held to maturity, management considers (1) issuer bond ratings, (2) the financial condition of the issuer, (3) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, and (4) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities.  Historical loss rates associated with securities having similar grades as those in the Corporation’s portfolio have generally not been significant. 
 An allowance for credit losses of $
245,000
 was recorded on state and municipal securities classified as held to maturity based on applying the long-term historical credit loss rate, as published by Moody’s, for similarly rated securities.  Details of the Corporation’s ACL - Investments are included in NOTE 4.  INVESTMENT SECURITIES of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  
LOANS HELD FOR SALE 
Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value.  Loan fees (net of certain direct loan origination costs) on loans held for sale are deferred until the related loans are sold or repaid.  Gains or losses on loan sales are recognized at the time of sale and determined using the specific identification method.
LOANS

The Corporation’s loan portfolio is carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income and principal charge-offs.  Loan origination fees, net of direct loan origination costs, and commitment fees are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to yield over the life of the loan, or over the commitment period, as applicable.  Interest income is accrued on the principal balances of loans.  The accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due.  When the interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed against earnings when considered uncollectible.  Interest income accrued in the prior year, if any, is charged to the allowance for credit losses.  Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received and the loan is returned to accruing status.  Details of the Corporation’s loan portfolio are included in NOTE 5.  LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
PURCHASED CREDIT DETERIORATED (“PCD”) LOANS 
The Corporation accounts for its acquisitions under ASC Topic 805, 
Business Combinations
, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting.  All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value.  The fair value of acquired loans at the time of acquisition is based on a variety of factors including discounted expected cash flows, adjusted for estimated prepayments and credit losses.  In accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, the fair value adjustment is recorded as a premium or discount to the unpaid principal balance of each acquired loan.  Acquired loans are classified into two categories: loans with more than insignificant credit deterioration (“PCD”) since origination, and loans with insignificant credit deterioration (“non-PCD”) since origination.  Factors considered when determining whether a loan has a more-than-insignificant deterioration since origination include, but are not limited to, the materiality of the credit, risk grade, delinquency, nonperforming status, bankruptcies, and other qualitative factors.  The net premium or discount on PCD loans is recorded in the Corporation’s allowance for credit losses on loans at the time of acquisition.  The remaining net premium or discount is accreted or amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using an effective yield method.  The net premium or discount on non-PCD loans, that includes credit and non-credit components, is accreted or amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using an effective yield method.  Additionally, non-PCD loans have an allowance for credit loss established on acquisition date, which is recognized in the current period provision for credit loss expense.  In the event of prepayment, unamortized discounts or premiums on PCD and non-PCD loans are recognized in interest income.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES - LOANS (“ACL - LOANS”)
The ACL - Loans is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on loans over the contractual term.  Loans are charged off against the allowance when the collectibility of the loan is unlikely.  Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged off and expected to be charged off.  Adjustments to the ACL - Loans are reported in the income statement as a component of provision for credit loss.  The Corporation has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on loans from the estimate of credit losses.  Further information regarding the policies and methodology used to estimate the ACL - Loans is detailed in NOTE 5.  LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

PENSION

The Corporation has defined-benefit pension plans, including non-qualified plans for certain employees, former employees and former non-employee directors.  In 2005, the Board of Directors of the Corporation approved the curtailment of the accumulation of defined benefits for future services provided by certain participants in the First Merchants Corporation Retirement Plan.  No additional pension benefits have been earned by any employees who had not met certain requirements as of March 1, 2005.  The benefits are based primarily on years of service and employees’ pay near retirement.  The Corporation’s accounting policies related to pensions and other post retirement benefits reflect the guidance in ASC 715, 
Compensation – Retirement Benefits. 
 The Corporation does not consolidate the assets and liabilities associated with the pension plan.  Instead, the Corporation recognizes the funded status of the plan in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The measurement of the funded status and the annual pension expense involves actuarial and economic assumptions.  Various statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to the plans.  Key factors include assumptions on the expected rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and health care costs and trends.  The Corporation considers market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates in making these assumptions.  The primary assumptions used in determining the Corporation’s pension and post retirement benefit obligations and related expenses are presented in NOTE 18. PENSION AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

Premises and equipment is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line and declining balance methods based on the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 
three
 to 
forty years
.  Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while major additions and improvements, which extend the useful life, are capitalized.  Gains and losses on dispositions are included in current operations.  Details of the Corporation’s premises and equipment are included in NOTE 6. PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
LEASES
The Corporation leases certain land and premises from third parties and all are classified as operating leases.  Operating leases are included in Other Assets and Other Liabilities on the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Right of Use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the term.  An ROU asset represents the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and also includes any direct costs and payments made prior to lease commencement and excludes lease incentives.  When an implicit rate is not available, an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date is used in determining the present value of the lease payments.  A lease term may include an option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the option will be exercised.  Short-term leases of twelve months or less are excluded from accounting guidance; as a result, the lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and the leases are not reflected on the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Renewal and termination options are considered when determining short-term leases.  Leases are accounted for at the individual level.  Details of the Corporation’s leases are included in NOTE 8. LEASES of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
QUALIFIED AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS
Qualified affordable housing investments are investments related to low income housing tax credits (“LIHTC”).  The purpose of the Corporation’s investment in LIHTC partnerships is to assist in achieving the goals of the Community Reinvestment Act and to earn an adequate return on capital via the federal income tax credit.  LIHTC partnerships are managed by unrelated general partners that have the power to direct the activities which most significantly affect the performance of the partnerships and, therefore, the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary of these partnerships.  Accordingly, the Corporation does not consolidate these variable interest entities into its consolidated financial statements. Investments in LIHTCs are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the unfunded commitments to provide additional capital for LIHTC investments are included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Additionally, the Corporation amortizes the cost of the qualifying investments in proportion to the tax credit and other tax benefits received over the life of the investment.  The amortization and income tax credits are included as a component of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Details of the Corporation’s LIHTC investments are included in NOTE 9. QUALIFIED AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK STOCK (“FHLB”)
FHLB stock is a required investment for institutions that are members of the FHLB.  The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Indianapolis.  Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts.  FHLB stock is carried at cost and is classified as a restricted security.  Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets are acquired assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability.  Intangible assets with definite useful lives are subject to amortization and relate to core deposits, customer relationships and non-compete agreements.  These intangible assets are being amortized on both the straight-line and accelerated basis over 
two
 to 
ten years
.  Intangible assets are periodically evaluated as to the recoverability of their carrying value.
  Details of the Corporation’s other intangible assets are included in NOTE 7. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

PART II: ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(table dollar amounts in thousands, except share data)
GOODWILL
Goodwill is maintained by applying the provisions of ASC 350, 
Intangibles – Goodwill and Other
.  For acquisitions, assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and the liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their fair value.  These often involve estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition, inflation, asset growth rates, or other relevant factors.  In addition, the determination of the useful lives over which the intangible asset will be amortized is subjective.  
Under ASC 350, the Corporation is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as well as on an interim basis, if events or changes indicate that the asset may be impaired, indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  The Corporation completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2024 and concluded, based on current events and circumstances goodwill is not impaired.  Details of the Corporation’s goodwill are included in NOTE 7. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
BANK OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (“BOLI”)
BOLI policies have been purchased, as well as obtained through acquisitions, on certain current and former employees and directors of the Corporation to offset a portion of the employee benefit costs.  The Corporation records the life insurance at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or amounts due that are probable at settlement.  Changes in cash surrender values and death benefits received in excess of cash surrender values are reported in noninterest income.  A corporate policy is in place with defined thresholds that limit the amount of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk inherent in a BOLI portfolio.  The Corporation actively monitors the overall portfolio performance along with the credit quality of the insurance carriers and the credit quality and yield of the underlying investments.

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED (“OREO”)
OREO consists of assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure and are held for sale.  They are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis.  Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.  Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation are included in other real estate owned and foreclosure expenses.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
Derivative instruments, which are recorded as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are carried at fair value and reflects the estimated amounts that would have been received or paid to terminate these contracts at the reporting date based upon pricing or valuation models applied to current market information.  As part of the asset/liability management program, the Corporation will utilize, from time to time, interest rate floors, caps or swaps to reduce its sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations.  Changes in the fair values of derivatives are reported in the consolidated statements of operations or AOCI depending on the use of the derivative and whether the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting.  The key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedged relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in those cash flows that are attributable to the hedged risk, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis.
Derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are designated as either: (1) a hedge of the fair value of the recognized asset or liability, or of an unrecognized firm commitment (a fair value hedge); or (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a cash flow hedge).  For cash flow hedges, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments are reported in AOCI to the extent the hedge is effective. The gains and losses on derivative instruments that are reported in AOCI are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the periods in which the results of operations are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item.  Generally, net interest income is increased or decreased by amounts receivable or payable with respect to the derivatives, which qualify for hedge accounting.  At inception of the hedge, the Corporation establishes the method it uses for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge.  The ineffective portion of the hedge, if any, is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  The Corporation excludes the time value expiration of the hedge when measuring ineffectiveness.
The Corporation offers interest rate derivative products (e.g. interest rate swaps) to certain of its high-quality commercial borrowers.  This product allows customers to enter into an agreement with the Corporation to swap their variable rate loan to a fixed rate.  These derivative products are designed to reduce, eliminate or modify the risk of changes in the borrower’s interest rate or market price risk.  The extension of credit incurred through the execution of these derivative products is subject to the same approvals and rigorous underwriting standards as the related traditional credit product.  The Corporation limits its risk exposure to these products by entering into a mirror-image, offsetting swap agreement with a separate, well-capitalized and rated counterparty previously approved by the Credit and Asset Liability Committee.  By using these interest rate swap arrangements, the Corporation is also better insulated from the interest rate risk associated with underwriting fixed-rate loans.  These derivative contracts are not designated against specific assets or liabilities under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge accounting.  The derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value of both the customer and the offsetting swap agreements are recorded (and essentially offset) in noninterest income.  The fair value of the derivative instruments incorporates a consideration of credit risk (in accordance with ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
), resulting in some volatility in earnings each period.

PART II: ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(table dollar amounts in thousands, except share data)
Commitments to fund certain mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors are considered derivatives.  It is the Corporation’s practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans.  These mortgage banking derivatives are not designated in hedge relationships.  Fair values were estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date of the commitments.  Changes in the fair value of these mortgage banking derivatives are included in net gains and fees on sales of loans.  In the normal course of business, the Corporation may decide to settle a forward contract rather than fulfill the contract.  Cash received or paid in this settlement manner is included in “Net gains and fees on sales of loans” in the Consolidated Statements of Income and is considered a cost of executing a forward contract. 
Details of the Corporation’s derivative instruments are included in NOTE 12. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
SECURITIES SOLD UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

Securities sold under repurchase agreements represent securities the Corporation routinely sells to certain treasury management customers and then repurchases these securities the next day.  Securities sold under repurchase agreements are reflected as secured borrowings in the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amount of cash received in connection with each transaction.  Details of the Corporation’s repurchase agreements are included in NOTE 11. BORROWINGS of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES - OFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES
The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is a liability account representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Corporation is exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit.  No allowance is recognized if the Corporation has the unconditional right to cancel the obligation.  Off-balance sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit.  For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance sheet exposure.  The likelihood and expected amount of funding are based on historical utilization rates.  The amount of the allowance represents management’s best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment.  The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted through the income statement as a component of provision for credit loss.  Further information regarding the policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is detailed in NOTE 5.  LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue recognition

guidance establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity’s contracts to provide goods or services to customers.  The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied.
The majority of the Corporation’s revenue-generating transactions are not subject to ASU 2014-09, including revenue generated from financial instruments, such as loans, letters of credit, derivatives and investment securities, as well as revenue related to mortgage servicing activities, as these activities are subject to other GAAP discussed elsewhere within the disclosures.  The Corporation has evaluated the nature of its contracts 
with customers and determined that further disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers into more granular categories beyond what is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income was not necessary.  Descriptions of revenue-generating activities that are within the scope of ASU 2014-09, which are presented in our income statements are as follows:
Service charges on deposit accounts:
  The Corporation earns fees from its deposit customers for transaction-based, account maintenance and overdraft services.  Transaction-based fees, which include services such as ATM use fees, stop payment charges, statement rendering and ACH fees, are recognized at the time the transaction is executed, which is the point in time the Corporation fulfills the customer’s request.  Account maintenance fees, which relate primarily to monthly maintenance, are earned monthly, representing the period which the Corporation satisfies the performance obligation.  Overdraft fees are recognized at the point in time that the overdraft occurs.  Service charges on deposits are withdrawn from the customer’s account balance.
Fiduciary activities
:  This represents monthly fees due from wealth management customers as consideration for managing the customers’ assets.  Wealth management and trust services include custody of assets, investment management, fees for trust services and similar fiduciary activities.  These fees are primarily earned over time as the Corporation provides the contracted monthly or quarterly services and are generally assessed based on the market value of assets under management at month-end.  Fees that are transaction-based are recognized at the point in time that the transaction is executed. 
Investment Brokerage Fees
:  The Corporation earns fees from investment brokerage services provided to its customers by a third-party service provider.  The Corporation receives commissions from the third-party provider on a monthly basis based upon customer activity for the month.  The fees are paid to us by the third party on a monthly basis and are recognized when received.
Interchange income
:  The Corporation earns interchange fees from debit and credit cardholder transactions conducted through the Visa and MasterCard payment networks.  Interchange fees from cardholder transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction value and are recognized concurrent with the transaction processing services provided to the cardholder.

PART II: ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(table dollar amounts in thousands, except share data)
Gains (Losses) on Sales of OREO
:  The Corporation records a gain or loss from the sale of OREO when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally occurs at the time of an executed deed.  When the Corporation finances the sale of OREO to the buyer, the Corporation assesses whether the buyer is committed to perform their obligations under the contract and whether collectability of the transaction price is probable.  Once these criteria are met, the OREO asset is derecognized and the gain or loss on sale is recorded upon the transfer of control of the property to the buyer.  In determining the gain or loss on the sale, the Corporation adjusts the transaction price and related gain (loss) on sale if a significant financing component is present.
TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been surrendered, or in the case of a loan participation, a portion of the asset has been surrendered and meets the definition of a “participating interest.”  Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Corporation and put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and (3) the Corporation does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Stock option and restricted stock award plans are maintained by the Corporation.  The compensation costs are recognized for stock options and restricted stock awards issued to employees and directors based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant.  A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options.  The market price of the Corporation’s common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the appropriate service period, which is generally 
three years
.  Details of the Corporation’s share-based compensation are included in NOTE 17. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

INCOME TAX
Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts from the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates.  A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  The Corporation files consolidated income tax returns with its subsidiaries.  The Corporation is generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2021.
The Corporation accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. Per the guidance in  ASC 740, the Corporation has not identified any uncertain tax positions that it believes should be recognized in the financial statements.  The Corporation reviews income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities quarterly; as new information becomes available, the balances are adjusted, if applicable.  The Corporation’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of income tax expense.  Details of the Corporation’s income taxes are included in NOTE 19. INCOME TAX of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding.  Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and non-vested restricted stock awards.  Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in the periods where the effect would be antidilutive.  Details of the Corporation’s net income per share are included in NOTE 20. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
RECENT ACCOUNTING CHANGES ADOPTED IN 2024
FASB Accounting Standards Updates - No. 2023-02
 - Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323) - Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method
Summary

- The FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, 
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method
, which is intended to improve the accounting and disclosures for investments in tax credit structures.  The ASU is a consensus of the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”).
The ASU allows reporting entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits.  The ASU responds to stakeholder feedback that the proportional amortization method provides investors and other allocators of capital with a better understanding of the returns from investments that are made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits and other income tax benefits.
Reporting entities were previously permitted to apply the proportional amortization method only to qualifying tax equity investments in low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) structures.  In recent years, stakeholders asked the FASB to extend the application of the proportional amortization method to qualifying tax equity investments that generate tax credits through other programs, which resulted in the EITF addressing this issue.
For public business entities, the amendments became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  For all other entities, the amendments will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities in any interim period.  The Corporation adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2024 and adoption did not have a significant impact on the Corporation’s financial statements or disclosures.

(table dollar amounts in thousands, except share data)
FASB Accounting Standards Updates - No. 2023-07 - 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280) — Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure
Summary 
- The FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure
, which is intended to improve disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and addresses requests from investors and other allocators of capital for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses.
The key amendments:
•
Require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss.
•
Require that a public entity disclose, on an annual and interim basis, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition.  The other segment items category is the difference between segment revenue less the significant expenses disclosed and each reported measure of segment profit or loss.
•
Require that a public entity provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by FASB ASC Topic 280,
 Segment Reporting
, in interim periods.
•
Clarify that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, a public entity may report one or more of those additional measures of segment profit or loss.  However, at least one of the reported segment profit or loss measures (or the single reported measure, if only one is disclosed) should be the measure that is most consistent with the measurement principles used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the public entity’s consolidated financial statements.
•
Require that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.
•
Require that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in the ASU and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280.
ASU No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, applies to all public entities that are required to report segment information in accordance with Topic 280. All public entities will be required to report segment information in accordance with the new guidance starting in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.  The Corporation adopted this guidance in 2024 and adoption did not have a significant impact on the Corporation’s financial statements or disclosures, as the Corporation has 
one
 operating segment.  See NOTE 22. SEGMENT INFORMATION of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure.
New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
The Corporation continually monitors potential accounting pronouncements and the following pronouncements have been deemed to have the most applicability to the Corporation's financial statements:
FASB Accounting Standards Update - No. 2023-09 - 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
Summary
 - The FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
 in the fourth quarter of 2023.  This ASU is intended to enhance income tax disclosures to address investor requests for more information about the tax risks and opportunities present in an entity’s worldwide operations.
The two primary enhancements disaggregate existing income tax disclosures related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid.  These amendments require that public business entities on an annual basis disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold.  The amendments also require that all entities disclose on an annual basis the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received).
For public business entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.  Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issue.  The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis.  The Corporation is assessing the terms of this guidance, but adoption of the standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Corporation’s financial statements or disclosures.
FASB Accounting Standards Update - No. 2024-03 - 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
Summary
 - The FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 
Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures 
in the fourth quarter of 2024.  This ASU requires public business entities to disclose specific information about certain costs and expenses in the notes to its financial statements for interim and annual reporting periods.  
The objective of the disclosure requirements is to provide disaggregated information about a public business entity's expenses to help investors (a) better understand the entity's performance, (b) better assess the entity's prospects for future cash flows, and (c) compare an entity's performance over time and with that of other entities. 
The  amendments  in  this  Update  are  effective  for  annual  reporting  periods beginning  after  December  15,  2026,  and  interim  reporting  periods  beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted.  The Corporation is assessing the terms of this guidance, but adoption of the standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Corporation’s financial statements or disclosures.

Level One Bancorp, Inc. 
On April 1, 2022, the Corporation acquired 
100
 percent of Level One Bancorp, Inc. (“Level One”).  Level One, a Michigan corporation, merged with and into the Corporation (the “Merger”), whereupon the separate corporate existence of Level One ceased and the Corporation survived.  Immediately following the Merger, Level One’s wholly owned subsidiary, Level One Bank, merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving bank.  
Level One was headquartered in Farmington Hills, Michigan and had 
17
 banking centers serving the Michigan market.  Pursuant to the merger agreement, each common shareholder of Level One received, for each outstanding share of Level One common stock held, (a) a 
0.7167
 share of the Corporation’s common stock, and (b) a cash payment of $
10.17
.  The Corporation issued 
5.6
 million shares of the Corporation’s common stock and paid $
79.3
 million in cash, in exchange for all outstanding shares of Level One common stock.
Additionally, the Corporation issued 
10,000
 shares of newly created 
7.5
 percent non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $
2,500
 per share, in exchange for the outstanding Level One Series B preferred stock.  Likewise, each outstanding Level One depositary share representing a 1/100th interest in a share of the Level One Series B preferred stock was converted into a depositary share of the Corporation representing a 1/100th interest in a share of its newly issued preferred stock (Nasdaq: FRMEP).
The Corporation engaged in this transaction with the expectation that it would be accretive to income and add to the existing market area in Michigan that has a demographic profile consistent with many of the current Midwest markets served by the Bank.  Goodwill resulted from this transaction due to the expected synergies and economies of scale.

10
 years.  Approximately $
1.4
 million was allocated to a non-compete intangible, which was amortized over its estimated life of 
2

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS
At December 31, 2024, the Corporation’s noninterest bearing deposits, included in cash and cash equivalents, and interest-bearing deposits held at other institutions exceeded the $250,000 federally insured limits by approximately $
35.8
 million
.  
Each correspondent bank’s financial performance and market rating are reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure the Corporation has deposits only at institutions providing minimal risk for those exceeding the federally insured limits.
Additionally, the Corporation had approximately 
$
283.4
 million at the Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank, which are government-sponsored entities not insured by the FDIC.
The Corporation has historically been required to maintain reserve funds in cash and/or on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank.  However, the Federal Reserve announced on March 15, 2020 that in order to support the flow of credit to households and businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, reserve requirement ratios would move to zero effective March 26, 2020.  The reserve requirement ratios remained at zero as of December 31, 2024.

PART II: ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(table dollar amounts in thousands, except share data)
Accrued interest on investment securities available for sale and held to maturity at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of $
22.5
 million and $
25.2
 million, respectively, is included in the Interest Receivable line on the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The total amount of accrued interest is excluded from the amortized cost of available for sale and held to maturity securities presented above. 
In determining the allowance for credit losses on investment securities available for sale that are in an unrealized loss position, the Corporation first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.  If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through the income statement.  For investment securities available for sale that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Corporation evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors.  In making this assessment, the Corporation considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors.  If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security.  If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.  Unrealized losses that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses are recognized in other comprehensive loss.  Adjustments to the allowance are reported in the income statement as a component of the provision for credit losses.  The Corporation has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on investment securities available for sale from the estimate of credit losses.  Investment securities available for sale are charged off against the allowance or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through the income statement when deemed uncollectible or when either of the aforementioned criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.  The Corporation did not record an allowance for credit losses on its investment securities available for sale as the unrealized losses were attributable to changes in interest rates, not credit quality.
The allowance for credit losses on investment securities held to maturity is a contra asset-valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of investment securities held to maturity to present the net amount expected to be collected.  Investment securities held to maturity are charged off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible.  Adjustments to the allowance are reported in the income statement as a component of the provision for credit losses.  The Corporation measures expected credit losses on investment securities held to maturity on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics, and considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The Corporation has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on investment securities held to maturity from the estimate of credit losses.  With regard to U.S. Government-sponsored agency and U.S. Government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, all these securities are issued by a U.S. government-sponsored entity and have an implicit or explicit government guarantee; therefore, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. With regard to securities issued by states and municipalities and other investment securities held to maturity, management considers (1) issuer bond ratings, (2) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (3) the financial condition of the issuer, and (4) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities.  Historical loss rates associated with securities having similar grades as those in the Corporation’s portfolio have been insignificant.  Furthermore, as of December 31, 2024, there were no past due principal and interest payments associated with these securities.  The balance of the allowance for credit losses on investment securities held to maturity remained unchanged at $
245,000
 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 based on applying the long-term historical credit rate, as published by Moody’s, for similar rated securities. 
On a quarterly basis, the Corporation monitors the credit quality of investment securities held to maturity through the use of credit ratings.  The following table summarizes the amortized cost of investment securities held to maturity at December 31, 2024, aggregated by credit quality indicator.

The unrealized losses in the Corporation’s investment portfolio were the result of changes in interest rates and not credit quality.  As a result, the Corporation expects to recover the amortized cost basis over the term of the securities.  The Corporation does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Corporation will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.  
Certain investment securities available for sale are reported in the financial statements at an amount less than their historical cost as indicated in the table below.

PART II: ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

(table dollar amounts in thousands, except share data)
In determining the fair value of the investment securities portfolio, the Corporation utilizes a third party for portfolio accounting services, including market value input, for those securities classified as Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  The Corporation has obtained an understanding of what inputs are being used by the vendor in pricing the portfolio and how the vendor classified these securities based upon these inputs.  From these discussions, the Corporation’s management is comfortable that the classifications are proper.  The Corporation has gained trust in the data for two reasons:  (a) independent spot testing of the data is conducted by the Corporation through obtaining market quotes from various brokers on a periodic basis; and (b) actual gains or losses resulting from the sale of certain securities has proven the data to be accurate over time.  Fair value of securities classified as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy was determined using a discounted cash flow model that incorporated market estimates of interest rates and volatility in markets that have not been active.
The amortized cost and fair value of investment securities available for sale and held to maturity at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, by contractual maturity are shown below.  Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  Securities not due at a single maturity are shown separately.

Credit Quality
As part of the ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of the Corporation’s loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to: (i) the level of criticized commercial loans, (ii) net charge-offs, (iii) nonperforming loans, (iv) covenant failures and (v) the general national and local economic conditions.
The Corporation utilizes a risk grading of pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss to assess the overall credit quality of large commercial loans.  All large commercial credit grades are reviewed at a minimum of once a year for pass grade loans.  Loans with grades below pass are reviewed more frequently depending on the grade.  A description of the general characteristics of these grades is as follows: 
•
Pass - Loans that are considered to be of acceptable credit quality.
•
Special Mention - Loans which possess some credit deficiency or potential weakness, which deserves close attention.  If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Corporation’s credit position at some future date.  Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose the Corporation to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification. 
•
Substandard - Loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Assets so classified have a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt.  They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
•
Doubtful - Loans that have all of the weaknesses of those classified as Substandard.  However, based on currently existing facts, conditions and values, these weaknesses make full collection of principal highly questionable and improbable. 
•
Loss – Loans that are considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuing to carry them as an asset is not warranted.  Loans will be classified as Loss when it is neither practical or desirable to defer writing off or reserving all or a portion of a basically worthless asset, even though partial recovery may be possible at some time in the future.

PART II: ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(table dollar amounts in thousands, except share data)
The following tables summarize the risk grading of the Corporation’s loan portfolio by loan class and gross charge-offs by year of origination for the years indicated. Consumer loans are not risk graded.  For the purposes of this disclosure, the consumer loans are classified in the following manner: loans that are less than 30 days past due are Pass, loans 30-89 days past due are Special Mention and loans greater than 89 days past due are Substandard.  The entire balance of a loan is considered delinquent if the minimum payment contractually required to be made is not received by the specified due date.

Loans are reclassified to a non-accruing status when, in management’s judgment, the collateral value and financial condition of the borrower do not justify accruing interest.  At the time the accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed against earnings.  Interest income accrued in the prior year, if any, is charged to the allowance for credit losses.  Payments subsequently received on non-accrual loans are applied to principal.  A loan is returned to accrual status when principal and interest are no longer past due and collectability is probable, typically after a minimum of six consecutive months of performance.
The following table summarizes the Corporation’s non-accrual loans by loan class as of the dates indicated:

PART II: ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(table dollar amounts in thousands, except share data)
Interest income on non-accrual loans is recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received in excess of principal due.  There was no interest income recognized on non-accrual loans for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
Determining fair value for collateral dependent loans requires obtaining a current independent appraisal of the collateral and applying a discount factor, which includes selling costs if applicable, to the value.  The fair value of real estate is generally based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers.  The appraisers typically determine the value of the real estate by utilizing an income or market valuation approach.  If an appraisal is not available, the fair value may be determined by using a cash flow analysis.  Fair value on other collateral such as business assets is typically ascertained by assessing, either singularly or some combination of, asset appraisals, accounts receivable aging reports, inventory listings and or customer financial statements.  Both appraised values and values based on borrower’s financial information are discounted as considered appropriate based on age and quality of the information and current market conditions.
The following tables present the amortized cost basis of collateral dependent loans by loan class and their respective collateral type, which are individually evaluated to determine expected credit losses, for December 31, 2024 and 2023.  The total collateral dependent loans for December 31, 2024 increased $
24.1
 million from December 31, 2023.  The primary changes were related to an increase of $
22.6
 million and $
10.1
 million, respectively, in the construction and commercial real estate, non-owner occupied loan classes, which was offset by a decrease of $
8.6
 million in the commercial and industrial loan class.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
The ACL - Loans is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected on loans over the contractual term.  The ACL - Loans is adjusted by the provision for credit losses, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by charge-offs for loans, net of recoveries.  Provision for credit losses on loans reflects the totality of actions taken on all loans for a particular period including any necessary increases or decreases in the allowance related to changes in credit loss expectations associated with specific loans or pools of loans.  Loans are charged off against the allowance when the collectibility of the loan is unlikely.  Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged off and expected to be charged off.  
The allowance represents the Corporation’s best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses.  The current expected credit loss (“CECL”) calculation is performed and evaluated quarterly and losses are estimated over the expected life of the loan.  The level of the ACL - Loans is believed to be adequate to absorb all expected future losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the measurement date.
In calculating the ACL - Loans, the loan portfolio was pooled into 
ten
 loan segments with similar risk characteristics.  Common characteristics include the type or purpose of the loan, underlying collateral and historical/expected credit loss patterns.  In developing the loan segments, the Corporation analyzed the degree of correlation in how loans within each portfolio respond when subjected to varying economic conditions and scenarios as well as other portfolio stress factors. 
The expected credit losses are measured over the life of each loan segment utilizing the Probability of Default / Loss Given Default methodology combined with economic forecast models to estimate the current expected credit loss inherent in the loan portfolio.  This approach is also leveraged to estimate the expected credit losses associated with unfunded loan commitments incorporating expected utilization rates. 
The Corporation sub-segmented certain commercial portfolios by risk level and certain consumer portfolios by delinquency status where appropriate.  The Corporation utilized a four-quarter reasonable and supportable economic forecast period followed by a six-quarter, straight-line reversion period to the historical macroeconomic mean for the remaining life of the loans.  Econometric modeling was performed using historical default rates and a selection of economic forecast scenarios published by Moody’s to develop a range of estimated credit losses for which to determine the best credit loss estimate within.  Macroeconomic factors utilized in the modeling process include the national unemployment rate, BBB US corporate index, CRE price index and the home price index.

PART II: ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(table dollar amounts in thousands, except share data)
The Corporation qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not inherently considered in the quantitative modeling process, but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within the loan portfolio.  These adjustments may increase or decrease the estimate of expected credit losses based upon the assessed level of risk for each qualitative factor.  The various risks that may be considered in making qualitative adjustments include, among other factors, the impact of (i) changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, (ii) changes in the existence, growth and effect of any concentrations in credit, (iii) changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections, write-offs, and recoveries, (iv) changes in the quality of the credit review function, (v) changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending, investment, collection and other relevant management staff, (vi) changes in the volume and severity of past due financial assets, the volume of the nonaccrual assets, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded assets, (vii) the value of underlying collateral for loans that are not collateral dependent, and (viii) other environmental factors of a borrower such as regulatory, legal and technological considerations, as well as competition and changes in the economic and business conditions that affect the collectability of financial assets.  At CECL adoption, the Corporation established certain qualitative factors that were expected to correlate to losses within the loan portfolio.  During a scheduled review of qualitative factors in 2023, the Corporation determined there had not been significant evidence of correlation to losses for the qualitative factors that included i) changes in experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff; ii) changes in lending policies and procedures; iii) changes in the quality of the credit review function; iv) portfolio mix and growth; and v) industry concentration.  The Corporation decided to refine these qualitative factors in order to improve our ability to assess related risk and enhance our ability to correlate to losses.  The Corporation’s evaluation of the qualitative approach resulted in an insignificant change to the ACL – Loans estimate.
In some cases, management may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics which differentiate the loan from other loans within the loan segments.  In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation.  Specific reserve allocations of the allowance for credit losses are determined by analyzing the borrower’s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk grade of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower’s industry, among other factors.  A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management’s assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral.  In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral.  The fair value of collateral supporting collateral dependent loans is evaluated on a quarterly basis. 
The risk characteristics of the Corporation’s portfolio segments are as follows:
Commercial
Commercial lending is primarily based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower.  The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value.  Most commercial loans are secured by the tangible assets being financed such as equipment or real estate or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee.  Other loans may be unsecured, secured but under-collateralized or otherwise made on the basis of the enterprise value of an organization.  In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers.
Commercial real estate
Commercial real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate.  Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan.  The Corporation monitors commercial real estate loans based on collateral and risk grade criteria, as well as the levels of owner-occupied versus non-owner occupied loans.
Construction
Construction loans are underwritten utilizing a combination of tools and techniques including feasibility and market studies, independent appraisals and appraisal reviews, absorption and interest rate sensitivity analysis as well as the financial analysis of the developer and all guarantors.  Construction loans are monitored by either in house or third party inspectors limiting advances to a percentage of costs or stabilized project value.  These loans frequently involve the disbursement of significant funds with the repayment dependent upon the successful completion and, where necessary, the future stabilization of the project.  The predominant inherent risk of this portfolio is associated with the borrower’s ability to successfully complete a project on time, within budget and stabilize the projected as originally projected. 
Consumer and Residential
With respect to residential loans that are secured by 1-4 family residences, which are typically owner occupied, the Corporation generally establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio and requires private mortgage insurance if that ratio is exceeded.  Home equity loans are secured by a subordinate interest in 1-4 family residences, and consumer loans are secured by consumer assets such as automobiles or recreational vehicles. Some consumer loans, such as small installment loans and certain lines of credit, are unsecured.  Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income and credit rating of the borrowers and can also be impacted by changes in property values.  Risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers.
The ACL - Loans decreased $
12.2
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.  The allowance decreased primarily due to $
49.4
 million of net charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2024.  The increase in net charge-offs was primarily related to 
two
 commercial relationships that accounted for $
42.7
 million of charge-offs. One borrower experienced a sudden change in revenue from the cancellation and inability to renegotiate their contracts with the U.S. Government. This negatively impacted the value of the borrower’s business and resulted in their inability to repay principal and interest. The second borrower provided notification of its plans to cease operations. The Corporation does not believe these charge-offs are indicative of the portfolio as a whole. In 2024, the Corporation recorded $
37.2
 million in provision for credit losses - loans, which was offset by a release in reserve of $
1.5
 million related to the allowance for unfunded commitments, resulting in a net provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 of $
35.7
 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Commitments And Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Corporation has entered into off-balance sheet financial instruments which include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.  Commitments to extend credit are usually the result of lines of credit granted to existing borrowers under agreements that the total outstanding indebtedness will not exceed a specific amount during the term of the indebtedness.  Typical borrowers are commercial concerns that use lines of credit to supplement their treasury management functions, and thus their total outstanding indebtedness may fluctuate during any time period based on the seasonality of their business and the resultant timing for their cash flows.  Other typical lines of credit are related to home equity loans granted to customers.  Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require a fee.  
Standby letters of credit are generally issued on behalf of an applicant (the Corporation’s customer) to a specifically named beneficiary and are the result of a particular business arrangement that exists between the applicant and the beneficiary.  Standby letters of credit have fixed expiration dates and are usually for terms of 
two years
 or less unless terminated beforehand due to criteria specified in the standby letter of credit.  The standby letter of credit would permit the beneficiary to obtain payment from the Corporation under certain prescribed circumstances.  Subsequently, the Corporation would seek reimbursement from the applicant pursuant to the terms of the standby letter of credit.  
The Corporation typically follows the same credit policies and underwriting practices when making these commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.  Each customer’s creditworthiness is typically evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and the amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer.  Collateral held varies but may include cash, real estate, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and personal property.  The contractual amounts of these commitments are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements and only amounts drawn upon would be reflected in the future.  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  However, should the commitments be drawn upon and should the Corporation’s customers default on their resulting obligation to the Corporation, the maximum exposure to credit loss, without consideration of collateral, is represented by the contractual amount of those commitments.

NOTE 8
LEASES
The Corporation enters into leases for certain retail branches, office space, land and equipment.  Operating leases are included in 
other assets
 and the lease liability is included in 
other liabilities
 in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Corporation does not have any finance leases. 
Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Corporation’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Corporation’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.  Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.  The Corporation uses its incremental borrowing rate at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments when the rate implicit in a lease is not known.  The Corporation’s incremental borrowing rate is based on the FHLB amortizing advance rate, adjusted for the lease term and other factors.  The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. 
The Corporation’s leases are generally for periods of 
five
 to 
twenty years
 with various renewal options.  The exercise of such lease renewal options is not included in the present value of lease obligations unless it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.  The Corporation has lease agreements which contain both lease and non-lease components such as common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes, and insurance.  Non-lease components are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and are recognized in expense when incurred.  The Corporation has elected not to recognize short-term leases, with original lease terms of twelve months or less, on the Corporation’s balance sheet.  Certain of the Corporation’s lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation.  The Corporation’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

First Merchants Capital Trust II (“FMC Trust II”). 
 At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had $
41.7
 million of subordinated debentures issued to FMC Trust II, a wholly-owned statutory business trust.  FMC Trust II was formed in July 2007 for purposes of issuing trust preferred securities to investors.  At that time, it simultaneously issued and sold its common securities to the Corporation, which constituted all of the issued and outstanding common securities of FMC Trust II.  The subordinated debentures, which were purchased with the proceeds of the sale of the trust’s capital securities, are the sole assets of FMC Trust II and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities bear interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month CME Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“CME Term SOFR”), plus the 
0.26161
 percent spread adjustment.  The interest rate at December 31, 2024 and 2023, was 
6.18
 percent and 
7.21
 percent, respectively.  The trust preferred securities are currently redeemable at par and without penalty, subject to the Corporation having first redeemed the related subordinated debentures, with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve if then required under applicable capital guidelines or policies.  The trust preferred securities and the subordinated debentures of FMC Trust II will mature on September 15, 2037.  The Corporation continues to hold all outstanding common securities of FMC Trust II. 
•
Ameriana Capital Trust I. 
 At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation had $
10.3
 million of subordinated debentures issued to Ameriana Capital Trust I.  On December 31, 2015, the Corporation acquired Ameriana Capital Trust I in conjunction with its acquisition of Ameriana Bancorp, Inc.  With a trust preferred structure substantially similar to that described above for FMC Trust II, the subordinated debentures held by Ameriana Capital Trust I were purchased with the proceeds of the sale of the trust’s capital securities.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities bear interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month CME Term SOFR, plus the 
0.26161
 percent spread adjustment. The interest rate at December 31, 2024 and 2023, was 
6.12
 percent and 
7.15
 percent, respectively.  The trust preferred securities of Ameriana Capital Trust I are currently redeemable at par and without penalty, subject to the Corporation having first redeemed the related subordinated debentures, with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve if then required under applicable capital guidelines or policies.  The trust preferred securities and the subordinated debentures of Ameriana Capital Trust I will mature in March 2036.  The Corporation continues to hold all of the outstanding common securities of Ameriana Capital Trust I.

First Merchants Senior Notes and Subordinated Notes.  
On November 1, 2013, the Corporation completed the private issuance and sale to 
four
 institutional investors of an aggregate of $
70
 million of debt comprised of (a) 
5.00
 percent Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2028 in the aggregate principal amount of $
5
 million (the “Senior Debt”) and (b) 
6.75
 percent Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due in 2028 in the aggregate principal amount of $
65
 million (the “Subordinated Debt”).  The interest rate on the Senior Debt and Subordinated Debt remained fixed for the first ten (
10
) years and converted to floating on October 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Senior Debt had an annual floating rate equal to three-month CME Term SOFR, plus the 
0.26161
 percent spread adjustment, plus 
2.345
 percent.  The interest rate on the Senior Debt was 
7.18
 percent and 
7.98
 percent as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The Corporation had an option to redeem the Subordinated Debt in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to 
100
 percent of the principal amount of the redeemed Subordinated Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the redemption.  The option of redemption was subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  The Corporation has an option to redeem the Senior Debt in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to 
100
 percent of the principal amount of the redeemed Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the redemption; provided, however, that no Subordinated Notes (as defined in the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement) may remain outstanding subsequent to any early redemption of Senior Notes. The Subordinated Debt and the Senior Debt options to redeem began with the interest payment date on October 30, 2023, or on any scheduled interest payment date thereafter.  During the first quarter of 2024, the Corporation exercised its rights to redeem $
40.0
 million in principal and paid the debt in full on the scheduled interest payment date.  Additionally, in the second quarter of 2024, the Corporation exercised its rights to redeem the remaining $
25.0
 million in principal and paid the debt on the scheduled interest payment date.  Both redemptions were permitted under the optional redemptions provisions of the Subordinated Note Certificate representing the Subordinated Debt.  The Senior Debt agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties and financial and negative covenants.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 the Corporation was in compliance with these covenants.
•
Level One Subordinated Notes.  
On April 1, 2022, the Corporation assumed certain subordinated notes in conjunction with its acquisition of Level One.  The $
30.0
 million of subordinated notes issued on December 18, 2019 bear a fixed interest rate of 
4.75
 percent per annum, payable semiannually through December 18, 2024.  The notes bear a floating interest rate equal to the three-month CME Term SOFR plus 
3.11
 percent, payable quarterly, after December 18, 2024 through maturity.  The notes mature on December 18, 2029, and the Corporation has the option to redeem any or all of the subordinated notes without premium or penalty any time after December 18, 2024 or upon the occurrence of a tier 2 capital event or tax event.

NOTE 12
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives
The Corporation is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.  The Corporation principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Corporation manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and through the use of derivative financial instruments.  Specifically, the Corporation enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  The Corporation’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Corporation’s known or expected cash payments principally related to certain variable-rate liabilities.  The Corporation also has derivatives that are a result of a service the Corporation provides to certain qualifying customers, and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Corporation’s assets or liabilities.  The Corporation manages a matched book with respect to its derivative instruments offered as a part of this service to its customers in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.
Derivatives Designated as Hedges
The Corporation’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  To accomplish these objectives, the Corporation primarily uses interest rate swaps and interest rate caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the payment of fixed amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Corporation receiving variable payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up-front premium.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 the Corporation had no interest rate swaps or caps designated as hedges.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation did not recognize any ineffectiveness.
Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Corporation's variable-rate liabilities. During the next twelve months, the Corporation doesn't expect to reclassify income (loss) associated with derivatives from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense.
The amount of gain recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) is included in the table below for the periods indicated.

Non-designated Hedges
The Corporation does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Corporation provides to certain customers. The Corporation executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies.  Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Corporation executes with a third party, such that the Corporation minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.  As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. 
Commitments to fund certain mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors are considered derivatives. It is the Corporation's practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from its commitments to fund the loans. These mortgage banking derivatives are not designated in hedge relationships. Fair values were estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date of the commitments. Changes in the fair value of these mortgage banking derivatives are included in net gains and fees on sales of loans. 
The table below presents the fair value of the Corporation’s non-designated hedges, as well as their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Corporation’s exposure to credit risk occurs because of nonperformance by its counterparties.  The counterparties approved by the Corporation are usually financial institutions, which are well capitalized and have credit ratings through Moody’s and/or Standard & Poor’s at or above investment grade.  The Corporation’s mitigation of such risk is through quarterly financial reviews, comparing mark-to-market values with policy limitations, credit ratings and collateral pledging.
Credit-risk-related Contingent Features
The Corporation has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Corporation fails to maintain its status as a well or adequately capitalized institution, then the Corporation could be required to terminate or fully collateralize all outstanding derivative contracts.  Additionally, the Corporation has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Corporation defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Corporation could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.  As of December 31, 2024, the termination value of derivatives in a net liability position related to these agreements was $
3.9
 million, which resulted in 
no
 collateral pledged to counterparties as of December 31, 2024.  While the Corporation did not breach any of these provisions as of December 31, 2024, if it had, the Corporation could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value.

PART II: ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(table dollar amounts in thousands, except share data)
NOTE 13
FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Corporation used fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.  The accounting guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  ASC 820 applies only when other guidance requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value; it does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances.
As defined in ASC 820, fair value is the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  It represents an exit price at the measurement date.  Market participants are buyers and sellers, who are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability being measured.  Current market conditions, including imbalances between supply and demand, are considered in determining fair value.  The Corporation values its assets and liabilities in the principal market where it sells the particular asset or transfers the liability with the greatest volume and level of activity.  In the absence of a principal market, the valuation is based on the most advantageous market for the asset or liability (i.e., the market where the asset could be sold or the liability transferred at a price that maximizes the amount to be received for the asset or minimizes the amount to be paid to transfer the liability).
Valuation inputs refer to the assumptions market participants would use in pricing a given asset or liability.  Inputs can be observable or unobservable.  Observable inputs are those assumptions which market participants would use in pricing the particular asset or liability.  These inputs are based on market data and are obtained from a source independent of the Corporation.  Unobservable inputs are assumptions based on the Corporation’s own information or estimate of assumptions used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability.  Unobservable inputs are based on the best and most current information available on the measurement date.  All inputs, whether observable or unobservable, are ranked in accordance with a prescribed fair value hierarchy which gives the highest ranking to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest ranking to unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market activity (Level 3).  Fair values for assets or liabilities classified as Level 2 are based on one or a combination of the following factors: (i) quoted prices for similar assets; (ii) observable inputs for the asset or liability, such as interest rates or yield curves; or (iii) inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.  The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  The Corporation considers an input to be significant if it drives 10 percent or more of the total fair value of a particular asset or liability.
RECURRING MEASUREMENTS
Assets and liabilities are considered to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis if fair value is measured regularly (i.e., daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly).  Recurring valuation occurs at a minimum on the measurement date.  Assets and liabilities are considered to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis if the fair value measurement of the instrument does not necessarily result in a change in the amount recorded on the balance sheet.  Generally, nonrecurring valuation is the result of the application of other accounting pronouncements which require assets or liabilities to be assessed for impairment and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.  The fair value of assets or liabilities transferred in or out of Level 3 is measured on the transfer date, with any additional changes in fair value subsequent to the transfer considered to be realized or unrealized gains or losses.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis and recognized in the
accompanying balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
Investment Securities
Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.  The Corporation did not have any Level 1 securities as of December 31, 2024.  Where significant observable inputs, other than Level 1 quoted prices, are available, securities are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  Level 2 securities include U.S. Government-sponsored agency and mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal securities and corporate obligations securities.  In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy and include state and municipal securities, U.S. Government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities and corporate obligations securities.  Level 3 fair value for securities was determined using a discounted cash flow model that incorporated market estimates of interest rates and volatility in markets that have not been active.
Third party vendors compile prices from various sources and may apply such techniques as matrix pricing to determine the value of identical or similar investment securities (Level 2).  Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique widely used in the banking industry to value investment securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for specific investment securities but rather relying on the investment securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted investment securities.  Any investment security not valued based upon the methods above are considered Level 3.

Collateral Dependent Loans
Determining fair value for collateral dependent loans requires obtaining a current independent appraisal of the collateral and applying a discount factor, which includes selling costs if applicable, to the value.  The fair value of real estate is generally based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers.  The appraisers typically determine the value of the real estate by utilizing an income or market valuation approach.  If an appraisal is not available, the fair value may be determined by using a cash flow analysis.  Fair value on other collateral such as business assets is typically ascertained by assessing, either singularly or some combination of, asset appraisals, accounts receivable aging reports, inventory listings and or customer financial statements.  Both appraised values and values based on borrower’s financial information are discounted as considered appropriate based on age and quality of the information and current market conditions.

The following is a discussion of the sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs, the interrelationships between those inputs and other unobservable inputs used in recurring fair value measurement and how those inputs might magnify or mitigate the effect of changes in the unobservable inputs on the fair value measurement.
State and Municipal Securities, Corporate Obligations, and U.S. Government-sponsored Mortgage Backed Securities
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation’s state and municipal securities, corporate obligations
and U.S. Government-sponsored mortgage backed securities are premiums for unrated securities and marketability discounts.  Significant
increases or decreases in either of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement.  Generally,
changes in either of those inputs will not affect the other input.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE
The following tables present estimated fair values of the Corporation’s financial instruments not carried at fair value and the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

REGULATORY CAPITAL AND DIVIDENDS
Regulatory Capital
Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance.  The Corporation and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies and are assigned to a capital category.  The assigned capital category is largely determined by four ratios that are calculated according to the regulations: total risk-based capital, tier 1 risk-based capital, common equity tier 1 (“CET1”), and tier 1 leverage ratios.  The ratios are intended to measure capital relative to assets and credit risk associated with those assets and off-balance sheet exposures of the entity.  The capital category assigned to an entity can also be affected by qualitative judgments made by regulatory agencies about the risk inherent in the entity’s activities that are not part of the calculated ratios.
There are five capital categories defined in the regulations, ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized.  Classification of a bank in any of the undercapitalized categories can result in actions by regulators that could have a material effect on a bank’s operations.  Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total risk-based capital, tier 1 capital and CET1 capital, in each case, to risk-weighted assets, and of tier 1 capital to average assets, or leverage ratio, all of which are calculated as defined in the regulations.  Banks with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, depending on their actual levels.  The appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade a bank to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the bank is in an unsafe or unsound practice.  Banks are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis for a change in capital category.
Basel III requires the Corporation and the Bank to maintain the minimum capital and leverage ratios as defined in the regulation and as illustrated in the following table, which capital to risk-weighted asset ratios include a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer.  Under Basel III, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends, the Corporation must hold a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized CET1 to risk-weighted assets ratio (which buffer is reflected in the required ratios below).  Under Basel III, the Corporation and Bank elected to opt-out of including accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital.  As of December 31, 2024, the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to be considered well capitalized under the fully phased-in Basel III capital rules. There is no threshold for well capitalized status for bank holding companies.

PART II: ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(table dollar amounts in thousands, except share data)
As part of a March 27, 2020 joint statement of federal banking regulators, an interim final rule that allowed banking organizations to mitigate the effects of the CECL accounting standard on their regulatory capital was announced.  Banking organizations could elect to mitigate the estimated cumulative regulatory capital effects of CECL for up to two years.  This two-year delay was to be in addition to the three-year transition period that federal banking regulators had already made available.  While the 2021 CAA provided for a further extension of the mandatory adoption of CECL until January 1, 2022, the federal banking regulators elected to not provide a similar extension to the two year mitigation period applicable to regulatory capital effects.  Instead, the federal banking regulators require that, in order to utilize the additional two-year delay, banking organizations must have adopted the CECL standard no later than December 31, 2020, as required by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act.  As a result, because implementation of the CECL standard was delayed by the Corporation until January 1, 2021, it began phasing in the cumulative effect of the adoption on its regulatory capital, at a rate of 25 percent per year, over a three-year transition period that began on January 1, 2021.  Under that phase-in schedule, the cumulative effect of the adoption was fully reflected in regulatory capital on January 1, 2024.
On November 1, 2013, the Corporation completed the private issuance and sale to 
four
 institutional investors of an aggregate of $
70
 million of debt comprised of (a) 
5.00
 percent Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2028 in the aggregate principal amount of $
5
 million  and (b) 
6.75
 percent Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due October 30, 2028 in the aggregate principal amount of $
65
 million. As of December 31, 2023 the Corporation began the 
five years
 phase out (at a rate of 
20
 percent per year) as defined in the Basil III capital rules, which resulted in a reduction of $
13
 million in tier 2 capital. The Corporation exercised its right to redeem $
40
 million of the subordinated debt on the scheduled interest payment date during the first quarter of 2024 and redeemed the remaining $
25.0
 million during the second quarter of 2024. 
On April 1, 2022, the Corporation assumed $
30.0
 million of subordinated notes in conjunction with its acquisition of Level One.  The notes mature on December 18, 2029, and the Corporation has the option to redeem any or all of the subordinated notes without premium or penalty any time after December 18, 2024 or upon the occurrence of a tier 2 capital event or tax event. As of December 31, 2024, these subordinated debentures were classified as tier 2 capital and were subject to the 
five year
 phase-out.

PART II: ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(table dollar amounts in thousands, except share data)
A reconciliation of certain non-GAAP amounts used in the determination of the above regulatory measures is detailed within the “Capital” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included as Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Management believes the disclosed capital ratios are meaningful measurements for evaluating the safety and soundness of the Corporation. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations.  The Federal Reserve focuses its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier 1 capital known as CET1.  Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock and non-controlling interest in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on CET1 is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories.  Tier I regulatory capital consists primarily of total stockholders’ equity and subordinated debentures issued to business trusts categorized as qualifying borrowings, less non-qualifying intangible assets and unrealized net securities gains or losses.
Dividends
The Corporation’s principal source of funds for dividend payments to shareholders is dividends received from the Bank.  Banking regulations limit the maximum amount of dividends that a bank may pay without requesting prior approval of regulatory agencies.  Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to the bank’s retained income (as defined under the regulations) for the current year plus those for the previous two years, subject to the capital requirements described above.  As of December 31, 2024, the amount available for dividends from the Corporation’s subsidiaries (both banking and non-banking), without prior regulatory approval or notice, was $
283.4
 million.
Additionally, the Corporation has a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, enabling stockholders to elect to have their cash dividends on all shares automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Corporation’s common stock.  In addition, stockholders may elect to make optional cash payments up to an aggregate of $
5,000
 per quarter for the purchase of additional shares of common stock.  The stock is credited to participant accounts at fair market value.  Dividends are reinvested on a quarterly basis.
Preferred Stock
As part of the Level One acquisition, the Corporation issued 
10,000
 shares of a newly created 
7.5
 percent non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a liquidation preference of $
2,500
 per share, in exchange for the outstanding Level One Series B preferred stock, and as part of that exchange, each outstanding Level One depositary share representing a 1/100th interest in a share of the Level One preferred stock was converted into a depositary share of the Corporation representing a 1/100th interest in a share of its newly issued preferred stock.  The Corporation had $
25.0
 million of outstanding preferred stock at December 31, 2024 and 2023.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the Corporation declared and paid dividends of $
187.52
 per share (equivalent to $
1.88
 per depositary share), equal to $
1.9
 million.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Corporation declared and paid dividends of $
187.52
 per share (equivalent to $
1.88
 per depositary share), equal to $
1.9
 million.  The Series A preferred stock qualifies as tier 1 capital for purposes of the regulatory capital calculations.
Stock Repurchase Program
On January 27, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Corporation approved a stock repurchase program of up to 
3,333,000
 shares of the Corporation’s outstanding common stock; provided, however, that the total aggregate investment in shares repurchased under the program may not exceed $
100,000,000
. On a share basis, the amount of common stock subject to the repurchase program represents approximately 
6
 percent of the Corporation’s outstanding shares at the time the program became effective. The Corporation repurchased 
1,648,466
 shares of its common stock pursuant to the repurchase program during 2024.  As of December 31, 2024, the Corporation had approximately 
1.0
 million shares at a maximum aggregate value of $
18.4
 million available to repurchase under the program.  The Corporation did not repurchase any shares of its common stock pursuant to the repurchase program during 2022 or 2023.
In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was enacted. Among other things, the IRA imposes a new 1 percent excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased after December 31, 2022 by publicly traded U.S. corporations (like the Corporation). With certain exceptions, the value of stock repurchased is determined net of stock issued in the year, including shares issued pursuant to compensatory arrangements.  For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the Corporation recorded excise tax of $
0.5
 million, related to its share repurchase during the period, which is reflected in the Stockholders’ Equity as a component of additional paid-in capital.

For certain loans, the originated loans are sold to third parties on a non-recourse basis with servicing rights retained.  The retained servicing rights are recorded as a servicing asset and are reported under the line item "Other Assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The associated amortization expense is included in "Other Noninterest Expense" in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Mortgage servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value and then carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. 
The following table presents changes in the servicing asset during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Stock options and Restricted Stock Awards (“RSA”) have been issued to directors, officers and other management employees under the Corporation’s 2024 Long-term Equity Incentive Plan, the 2019 Long-term Equity Incentive Plan, the Level One Bancorp, Inc. 2007 Stock Option Plan and the Equity Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors.  The stock options, which have a 
ten-year
 life, become 
100
 percent vested based on time ranging from 
one year
 to 
two years
 and are fully exercisable when vested.  Option exercise prices equal the Corporation’s common stock closing price on Nasdaq on the date of grant.  The RSAs issued to employees and non-employee directors provide for the issuance of shares of the Corporation’s common stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after 
three years
.  The RSAs vest only if the employee is actively employed by the Corporation on the vesting date and, therefore, any unvested shares are forfeited.  For non-employee directors, the RSAs vest only if the non-employee director remains as an active board member on the vesting date and, therefore, any unvested shares are forfeited. The RSAs for employees and non-employee directors are either immediately vested at retirement, disability or death, or, continue to vest after retirement, disability or death, depending on the plan under which the shares were granted. 
The Corporation’s 2024 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) provides eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries an opportunity to purchase shares of common stock of the Corporation through quarterly offerings financed by payroll deductions.  The price of the stock to be paid by the employees shall be equal to 
85
 percent of the average of the closing price of the Corporation’s common stock on each trading day during the offering period.  However, in no event shall such purchase price be less than the lesser of an amount equal to 
85
 percent of the market price of the Corporation’s stock on the offering date or an amount equal to 
85
 percent of the market value on the date of purchase. Common stock purchases are made quarterly and are paid through advance payroll deductions up to a calendar year maximum of $
25,000
.  The 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan expired on June 30, 2024.
Compensation expense related to unvested share-based awards is recorded by recognizing the unamortized grant date fair value of these awards over the remaining service periods of those awards, with no change in historical reported fair values and earnings.  Awards are valued at fair value in accordance with provisions of share-based compensation guidance and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the service periods of each award.  To complete the exercise of vested stock options, RSAs and ESPP options, the Corporation generally issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool.  Share-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $
5.8
 million, $
5.2
 million, and $
4.7
 million, respectively, and has been recognized as a component of salaries and benefits expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
Share-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures.  Share-based compensation guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  Pre-vesting forfeitures were estimated to be approximately 
0.05
 percent for the year ended December 31, 2024, based on historical experience.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the Corporation’s closing stock price on the last trading day of 2024 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their stock options on December 31, 2024.  The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair value of the Corporation’s common stock.  
The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
707,000
 and $
1.4
 million, respectively.  Cash receipts of stock options exercised during 2024 and 2023 were $

PENSION AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
The Corporation’s defined-benefit pension plans, including non-qualified plans for certain employees, former employees and former non-employee directors, cover approximat
e
ly 
9
 percent of the Corporation’s employees. In 2005, the Board of Directors of the Corporation approved the curtailment of the accumulation of defined benefits for future services provided by certain participants in the First Merchants Corporation Retirement Plan.  No additional pension benefits have been earned by any employees who had not attained both the age of 
55
 and accrued at least 
10
 years of vesting service as of March 1, 2005.  The benefits are based primarily on years of service and employees’ pay near retirement. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service-to-date, but also for those expected to be earned in the future.   
The table below sets forth the plans’ funded status and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, using measurement dates of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

 basis points from 
5.10
 percent to 
5.60
 percent, which decreased the liability $
1.7
 million and the assets in the plan earned a return of $

The Savings Plan, a Section 401(k) qualified defined contribution plan, was amended on March 1, 2005 to provide enhanced retirement benefits, including employer and matching contributions, for eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries.  The Corporation matches employees’ contributions at the rate of 
100
 percent for the first 
3
 percent of base salary contributed by participants and 
50
 percent of the next 
3
 percent of base salary contributed by participants.
Beginning in 2005, employees who have completed 
1000
 hours of service and are an active employee on the last day of the year receive an additional retirement contribution after year-end.  Employees hired after January 1, 2010 do not participate in the additional retirement contribution.  Effective January 1, 2013, the additional retirement contribution was fixed at 
2
 percent.  Full vesting occurs after 
five years
 of service.  The Corporation’s expense for the Savings Plan, including the additional retirement contribution, was $
7.0
 million, $
7.2
 million and $
6.5
 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The Corporation also maintains a post retirement benefit plan that provides health insurance benefits for a closed group of participants that came to the Corporation through the 2019 MBT acquisition.  To be eligible for the post retirement plan, the participants must (1) have been hired by MBT prior to January 1, 2007, (2) be a full-time employee of the Corporation and employed by MBT prior to the acquisition, and (3) be at least 
55
 years of age with 
5
 years of full-time service with MBT.  The plan allowed retirees to be carried under the Corporation’s health insurance plan, generally from ages 
55
 to 
65
.  The retirees’ premiums are determined based on their retiree class (per historical MBT guidelines) and also determined by the plan type for which the retiree is enrolled.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the obligation payable under the post retirement plan was $
0.3
 million and $
2.3
 million, respectively.  Post retirement plan expense totaled $
32,000
, $
44,000
 and $
53,000
 for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Pension Plan Assets
The plans’ investment strategies are to provide for preservation of capital with an emphasis on long-term growth without undue exposure to risk. The assets of the plans are invested in accordance with the plans’ Investment Policy Statement, subject to strict compliance with ERISA and any other applicable statutes.  The plans’ risk management practices include semi-annual evaluations of investment managers, including reviews of compliance with investment manager guidelines and restrictions; ability to exceed performance objectives; adherence to the investment philosophy and style; and ability to exceed the performance of other investment managers.  The evaluations are reviewed by management with appropriate follow-up and actions taken, as deemed necessary.  The Investment Policy Statement generally allows investments in cash and cash equivalents, real estate, fixed income debt securities and equity securities, and specifically prohibits investments in derivatives, options, futures, private placements, short selling, non-marketable securities and purchases of individual non-investment grade bonds.
Plan assets are re-balanced quarterly. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, plan assets by category are as follows:

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the general classification of pension plan assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, plan assets are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.  Level 1 plan assets total $
69.2
 million and $
76.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and include cash and cash equivalents, common stocks, mutual funds and corporate bonds and notes.  If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of plan assets with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows.  Level 2 plan assets total $
10.3
 million and $
5.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and include governmental agencies, taxable municipal bonds and notes, and certificates of deposit.  In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, plan assets are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.  There are no assets classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

As of December 31, 2024, the Corporation has approximately $
25.0
 million of state NOL carryforwards available to offset future state taxable income, which will expire beginning in 2025.  These NOL carryforwards along with normal timing differences between book and tax result in total state deferred tax assets of $
6.7
 million.  Management believes it is more likely than not that the benefit of these state NOL carryforwards and other state deferred tax assets will be fully realized. 
The Corporation has additional paid-in capital that is considered restricted resulting from the acquisitions of CFS Bancorp, Inc. (“CFS”) and Ameriana Bancorp, Inc. (“Ameriana”) of approximately $
13.4
 million and $
11.9
 million, respectively.  CFS and Ameriana qualified as banks under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which permitted them to deduct from taxable income an allowance for bad debts which differed from the provision for losses charged to income, for which no deferred federal income tax liability has been recognized.  If in the future this portion of additional paid-in capital is distributed, or the Corporation no longer qualifies as a bank for income tax purposes, federal income taxes may be imposed at the then applicable tax rate.  The unrecorded deferred tax liability at December 31, 2024, would have been approximately $
5.3
 million. 
The Corporation or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions.  The Corporation is generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2021.  
Additional details regarding the Corporation’s policies related to income taxes are discussed in NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES of these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
NOTE 20
NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the reporting period.  Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the combination of the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the reporting period and all potentially dilutive common shares.  Potentially dilutive common shares include stock options and RSAs issued under the Corporation’s share-based compensation plans.  Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share in the periods where the effect would be antidilutive.

NOTE 22
SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Corporation has 
one
 reportable segment, community banking.  The Corporation’s reportable segment is determined by the Chief Executive Officer, who is the designated chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), based upon information provided about the Corporation’s products and services offered.  The CODM will evaluate the financial performance of the Corporation’s business components by evaluating revenue streams, significant expenses, and budget to actual results in assessing the Corporation’s segment.  The Corporation generates revenue primarily by providing banking services to its customers.  Interest expense, provisions for credit losses and salaries and employee benefits are the significant expenses in the banking operations.  The CODM evaluates performance, allocates resources and makes key operating decisions based on consolidated net income that is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  The measure of segment assets is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as total consolidated assets.  All operations are domestic.
NOTE 23
GENERAL LITIGATION
The Corporation is subject to claims and lawsuits that arise primarily in the ordinary course of business.  It is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate resolution of such claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flow of the Corporation.

PART II: ITEM 9., ITEM 9A. AND ITEM 9B.
ITEM 9.   CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.
In connection with its audits for the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2024, there have been no disagreements with the Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or audit scope or procedure, nor have there been any changes in accountants.
ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
At the end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation Date”), the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).  Based upon that evaluation, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Corporation’s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.
MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management of First Merchants Corporation (the “Corporation”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Corporation’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.  As part of its function of assisting the Corporation’s Board of Directors in discharging its responsibility of ensuring financial reporting and regulatory risks to the organization are properly being managed, mitigated and monitored by Management, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees management’s internal controls over financial reporting.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Accordingly, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.  In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 is effective based on the specified criteria. 
There have been no changes in the Corporation’s internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation referenced above that occurred during the Corporation’s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.
FORVIS MAZARS, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which appears as follows.

PART II: ITEM 9., ITEM 9A., ITEM 9B. AND ITEM 9C.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders, Board of Directors and Audit Committee 
First Merchants Corporation
Muncie, Indiana
Opinion on the Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited First Merchants Corporation’s (the “Corporation”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) 
issued by COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and our report dated February 24, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management Report of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definitions and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of reliable financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A corporation’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the corporation; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the corporation’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
