Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," the terms "we," "us," "the Company," "our," "LKQ" and similar terms refer to LKQ Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Overview
We are a global distributor of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty aftermarket products and accessories to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles.
Buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by OEMs; new products produced by companies other than the OEMs, which are referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained from salvage and total loss vehicles; recycled products that have been refurbished; and recycled products that have been remanufactured. We distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket collision and mechanical products; recycled collision and mechanical products; refurbished collision products such as wheels, bumper covers and lights; and remanufactured engines and transmissions. Collectively, we refer to the four sources that are not new OEM products as alternative parts.
We are organized into four operating segments: Wholesale - North America; Europe; Specialty; and Self Service, each of which is presented as a reportable segment.
Our Wholesale - North America segment is a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products, paint and body repair related products, and alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the United States and Canada. Our Europe segment is a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in Germany, the U.K., the Benelux region, Italy, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, France and various other European countries. Our Specialty segment is a leading distributor of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories reaching most major markets in the U.S. and Canada. Our Self Service segment operates self service retail facilities across the U.S. that sell recycled automotive products from end-of-life-vehicles.
Our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Please refer to the factors referred to in Special Note on Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors above. Due to these factors and others, which may be unknown to us at this time, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate. Accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.
Acquisitions and Investments
Since our inception in 1998, we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. Our current acquisition strategy focuses on highly accretive tuck-in acquisitions with significant synergies or critical capabilities and no large platform acquisitions are expected. Additionally, from time to time, we make investments in various businesses to advance our strategic objectives. See Note 3, "Business Combinations" and Note 10, "Equity Method Investments" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our acquisitions and investments. 
Sources of Revenue
We report our revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other. Our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty products and accessories used to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles. Our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of service-type warranties, fees for admission to our self service yards, and 
32
diagnostic and repair services. During the year ended December 31, 2024, parts and services revenue represented 95.6% of our consolidated revenue. Revenue from other sources includes sales of scrap and other metals (including precious metals - platinum, palladium and rhodium - contained in recycled parts such as catalytic converters), bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers (including cores) and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations. Other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold. See Note 12, "Revenue Recognition" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our sources of revenue.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Historically, we have not made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates as our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates. We do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future; however, actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
Critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and which require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. For additional information related to significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, see Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Goodwill Impairment
Description
Goodwill is obtained through business acquisitions and recorded at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment annually or sooner if events indicate that an impairment may exist. In performing this test, we compare the carrying value of the asset to its fair value. To derive the fair value for our reporting units which carry goodwill, we consider the use of various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach via a discounted cash flow method and another being a market approach via a guideline public company method. If the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value, the asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recognized. In performing the test for impairment of goodwill, goodwill is allocated to the reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. 
Judgments and Uncertainties
Determining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating fair values as part of impairment testing require significant judgment. Estimating the fair values of our reporting units which have goodwill requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. As part of applying the discounted cash flow method and guideline public company method, we use significant assumptions which include sales growth, operating margins, discount rates, perpetual growth rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets, business plans, economic projections and marketplace data.
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change
The balance of our goodwill was $5,448 million and $5,600 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
, respectively. We have not made material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill during the last three years. The assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends, macroeconomic conditions, and projections consistent with the Company’s operating strategy. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses. During fiscal year 2024, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for our goodwill. No impairment charges were recorded as a result of the testing as the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit exceeded the calculated carrying value. A 10% decline in projected cash flows or a 10% increase in the discount rate would not have resulted in an impairment to goodwill.
33
Business Combinations
Description
We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, including purchased intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
Judgments and Uncertainties
Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in relation to the acquisitions are appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, information obtained from management of the acquired companies and information obtained from independent third party valuation firms and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales and customer contracts, estimated royalty rates used in valuing related intangible assets, customer attrition rates and discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change
While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Changes in the estimates applied or values of acquired assets and liabilities could have a material impact on our financial statements. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the originally assigned values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
See "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to new accounting standards.
Financial Information by Geographic Area
See Note 12, "Revenue Recognition" and Note 25, "Segment and Geographic Information" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our revenue and long-lived assets by geographic region.
Key Performance Indicators
We believe that organic revenue growth, Segment EBITDA and free cash flow are key performance indicators for our business. Segment EBITDA is our key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). Free cash flow is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”).
•
Organic revenue growth 
- We define organic revenue growth as total revenue growth from continuing operations excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures (i.e., revenue generated from the date of acquisition to the first anniversary of that acquisition, net of reduced revenue due to the disposal of businesses) and foreign currency movements (i.e., impact of translating revenue at different exchange rates). Organic revenue growth includes incremental sales from both existing and new (i.e., opened within the last twelve months) locations and is derived from expanding business with existing customers, securing new customers and offering additional products and services. We believe that organic revenue growth is a key performance indicator as this statistic measures our ability to serve and grow our customer base successfully.
34
•
Segment EBITDA
 - See Note 25, "Segment and Geographic Information" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the calculation of Segment EBITDA. We believe that Segment EBITDA provides useful information to evaluate our segment profitability by focusing on the indicators of ongoing operational results.
•
Free Cash Flow
 - We calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Free cash flow provides insight into our liquidity and provides useful information to management and investors concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase stock, and pay dividends.
These three key performance indicators are used as targets in determining incentive compensation at various levels of the organization, including senior management. By using these performance measures, we attempt to motivate a balanced approach to the business that rewards growth, profitability and cash flow generation in a manner that enhances our long-term prospects.

The increase in parts and services revenue of $544 million, or 4.1%, represented increases in segment revenue of 9.9% in Wholesale - North America and 1.3% in Europe, partially offset by decreases of 8.4% in Self Service and 0.7% in Specialty. This overall

increase was driven by a 6.3% increase due to the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by an organic parts and services revenue decline of 2.2%. The decrease in other revenue of 7.8% was primarily driven by a decrease in organic revenue of $56 million, or 8.1%, due to lower commodities prices and volumes compared to the prior year, which resulted in a $46 million organic revenue decrease in our Self Service segment and a $12 million organic revenue decrease in our Wholesale - North America segment. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in revenue by segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased to 60.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 59.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cost of goods sold primarily reflects an increase of 1.0% from our Wholesale - North America segment. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 27.3% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 27.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The year over year decrease in SG&A expense primarily reflects an impact of 0.7% related to our Wholesale - North America segment. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses
Restructuring and transaction related expenses increased by $70 million, primarily due to (i) a $98 million increase in restructuring expenses related to our 2024 Global Restructuring plan, partially offset by (ii) a $17 million decrease related to transaction related expenses and (iii) an $8 million decrease in restructuring expenses related to our 2022 Global Restructuring Plan.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense increased by

$78 million, primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of $56 million driven by an increase in Wholesale - North America primarily due to our acquisition of Uni-Select in August 2023. 
Provision for Income Taxes
See Note 23, "Income Taxes" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Total Other Expense, Net
Interest Expense
Interest expense

increased by

$48 million, primarily due to (i) a $52 million increase from higher outstanding debt primarily related to the permanent financing for the Uni-Select Acquisition, and (ii) a $5 million increase from higher interest rates for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, partially offset by (iii) a $9 million decrease related to amortization of pre-acquisition bridge loan financing costs related to the Uni-Select Acquisition.
Gains on Foreign Exchange Contracts - Acquisition Related
Gains on foreign exchange contracts - acquisition related decreased due to the $49 million pretax gain on the foreign exchange forward contracts related to the Uni-Select Acquisition in 2023. See Note 3, "Business Combinations" and Note 19, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
36
Foreign Currency Impact
We translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. Relative to the rates used for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Czech koruna and Canadian dollar rates used to translate the 2024 statements of income decreased by 4.4% and 1.5%, respectively, while the pound sterling rate increased by 2.7% and the euro was flat. Realized and unrealized currency gains and losses (including the effects of hedge instruments) combined with the translation effect of the change in foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar had a net negative effect of $0.20 on diluted earnings per share relative to the prior year primarily related to the $49 million pretax gain on the foreign exchange forward contracts related to the Uni-Select Acquisition in 2023. 
Results of Operations—Segment Reporting
We have four reportable segments: Wholesale - North America; Europe; Specialty; and Self Service. 
We have presented the growth of our revenue and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth and profitability, consistent with how we evaluate our performance, as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance. Constant currency revenue and Segment EBITDA results are calculated by translating prior year revenue and Segment EBITDA in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. This non-GAAP financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. In addition, not all companies that report revenue or profitability on a constant currency basis calculate such measures in the same manner as we do, and accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.

The key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our CODM, our Chief Executive Officer, is Segment EBITDA. The CODM uses Segment EBITDA to compare profitability among the segments and evaluate business strategies. Segment EBITDA includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. Corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue. We calculate Segment EBITDA as Net Income excluding net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interest; income and loss from discontinued operations; depreciation; amortization; interest; gains and losses on debt extinguishment; income tax expense; restructuring and transaction related expenses; change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; other gains and losses related to acquisitions, equity method investments, or divestitures; equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries; equity investment fair value adjustments; impairment charges; and direct impacts of the Ukraine/Russia conflict. See Note 25, "Segment and Geographic Information" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of total Segment EBITDA to net income.

Parts and services revenue increased by $491 million, or 9.9%, to $5,465 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily driven by acquisitions, net of divestitures revenue of $779 million, or 15.7%, primarily due to the acquisition of Uni-Select in the third quarter of 2023. See

Note 3, "Business Combinations" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the acquisition of Uni-Select. This was partially offset by an organic revenue decrease of $278 million, or 5.6% (6.3% on a per day basis), primarily due to a reduction in aftermarket collision volumes, which were negatively impacted by a reduction in repairable claims. We believe this is mainly attributable to difficult economic conditions. Additionally, organic revenue was negatively impacted by (i) a reduction in paint revenue related to increased competition and (ii) weather related events in 2024.
(2)
Gross margin increased by $25 million, or 1.0%, to $2,511 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This increase was driven by the acquisition of Uni-Select, partially offset by a decrease in parts and services organic revenue and a decline in commodities prices. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of total segment revenue of 3.4% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily due to the dilutive nature of the acquisition of Uni-Select, which changed the segment's product mix to reflect a greater percentage of paint, body and equipment and maintenance product lines. These product lines have a lower gross margin structure than our other wholesale product lines. Additionally, the gross margin was negatively affected by the related mix effect resulting from lower aftermarket revenue, which has a higher margin than our other wholesale lines as well as decreases in salvage margins tied to softening salvage revenue and a decline in commodities prices.
(3)
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $32 million, or 2.3%, to $1,567 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expense primarily reflects unfavorable impacts of (i) $71 million from personnel costs excluding incentive compensation primarily due to the acquisition of Uni-Select, (ii) $36 million from facility costs primarily due to the acquisition of Uni-Select, (iii) $11 million from increased freight, vehicle, and fuel costs, partially offset by (iv) $42 million from lower incentive compensation, (v) $27 million from 
38
professional fees primarily related to proceeds from the favorable settlement of a legal claim in 2024, (vi) $6 million from lower charitable contributions in the prior year period, and (vii) other individually immaterial factors representing an $11 million favorable impact in the aggregate. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of total segment revenue decreased by 1.8% to 27.2% for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition to the factors noted above, the decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of total segment revenue was driven by cost saving initiatives and acquisition related synergies, partially offset by inflationary pressures.
(4)
Amounts primarily represent other non operating income and expenses, as well as reconciling items to remove depreciation - cost of goods sold and restructuring - cost of goods sold, which are excluded from the calculation of Segment EBITDA. See Note 13, "Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on restructuring charges.

Parts and services revenue increased by $83 million, or 1.3%, to $6,386 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily due to a parts and services organic revenue increase of $76 million, or 1.2% (0.7% on a per day basis), driven by pricing initiatives to offset increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures and, to a lesser extent, increased volumes.
(2)
Gross margin increased by $17 million, or 0.7%, to $2,454 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to increased revenue through pricing initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable customer mix, inflationary pressures and a $16 million reduction primarily related to restructuring expenses incurred as part of the 2024 Global Restructuring Plan. These restructuring expenses are excluded from the calculation of Segment EBITDA. See Note 13, "Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses" and Note 25, "Segment and Geographic Information" for further information.

Parts and services revenue decreased by $11 million, or 0.7%, to $1,654 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This was primarily due to a parts and services organic revenue decrease of $75 million, or 4.5% (5.3% on a per day basis), driven by demand softness in the RV and automotive product lines, as unit retail sales for RV and certain automotive categories have declined year over year. This was partially offset by a net increase of $66 million, or 4.0%, in acquisition and divestiture revenue primarily related to our acquisition of one Specialty business in 2023.
(2)
Gross margin decreased by $11 million, or 2.6%, to $419 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This decrease was primarily driven by higher discounts to help maintain sales volume in the first six months of the year, as well as lower revenue.
(3)
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $10 million, or 3.3%, to $315 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses reflects unfavorable impacts of (i) $5 million from increased personnel costs, (ii) $3 million related to higher credit loss reserves compared to prior year, and (iii) other individually immaterial factors representing a $5 million unfavorable impact in the aggregate, partially offset by a favorable impact of (iv) $3 million due to lower freight, vehicle and fuel expenses.

Parts and services organic revenue decreased by $19 million, or 8.4% (8.7% on a per day basis), to $213 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to lower parts volumes from a reduced number of customer admissions.
(2)
Other organic revenue decreased $46 million, or 12.7%, to $319 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This decrease was primarily driven by (i) a $28 million decrease in revenue from precious metals due to lower prices and lower volumes and (ii) a $24 million decrease in revenue from scrap steel primarily related to lower volumes and lower prices, partially offset by (iii) a $6 million increase in revenue from other scrap (e.g., aluminum) and cores due to higher prices, partially offset by lower volumes.
(3)
Gross margin increased by $5 million, or 2.3%, to $227 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase is attributable to improvements in vehicle procurement costs, partially offset by lower commodities prices. Decreases in precious metals prices contributed an estimated $13 million decline in gross margin relative to the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, scrap steel prices had a $2 million unfavorable impact on gross margin, compared to a $5 million favorable impact during the year ended December 31, 2023. The unfavorable impacts for the year ended December 31, 2024 resulted from decreases in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased a vehicle, which influences the price we pay for a vehicle, and the date we scrapped a vehicle, which influences the price we receive for scrapping a vehicle.
(4)
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $9 million, or 5.0%, to $179 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily reflects individually immaterial factors representing a $9 million favorable impact in the aggregate primarily related to operational productivity initiatives.

Parts and services revenue increased by $767 million, or 18.2%, to $4,974 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an acquisition and divestiture parts and services revenue net increase of $432 million, or 10.3%, primarily due to the acquisition of Uni-Select in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by the divestiture of our PGW aftermarket glass business in the second quarter of 2022. See

Note 3, "Business Combinations" and "Other Divestitures (Not Classified in Discontinued Operations)" in Note 4, "Discontinued Operations and Divestitures" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the acquisition of Uni-Select and the divestiture of PGW, respectively. Additionally, parts and services organic revenue increased 8.2% (8.6% on a per day basis) for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily driven pricing initiatives which focused on offsetting inflation on input costs and a net volume increase. Aftermarket collision parts volumes increased year over year due to reduced pressures on our supply chain. Aftermarket 
41
collision parts volumes also grew as a result of the continued rollout of State Farm's aftermarket parts program, which began on a trial basis in June 2022 and has subsequently been expanded.
(2)
Other revenue decreased by $42 million, or 12.0%, to $307 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to an other organic revenue decrease of $41 million, or 11.8%, primarily related to (i) a $46 million decrease in revenue from precious metals (platinum, palladium, and rhodium) due to lower prices, partially offset by higher volumes, partially offset by (ii) a $5 million increase in revenue from other scrap (e.g., aluminum) and cores due to higher volumes, partially offset by lower prices.
(3)
Gross margin increased by $277 million, or 12.5%, to $2,486 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of total segment revenue of was primarily driven by (i) an unfavorable impact of 2.1% related to the acquisition of Uni-select in the third quarter of 2023 due to product mix as the paint, body, and equipment and maintenance parts lines have a lower gross margin structure than other wholesale product lines, partially offset by (ii) a 0.5% benefit from lower inbound freight costs and (iii) a 0.2% mix benefit resulting from the PGW divestiture in the second quarter of 2022.
(4)
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $163 million, or 11.8%, to $1,535 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects favorable impacts of (i) 0.9% related to the acquisition of Uni-Select as Uni-Select operates with lower overhead expenses than our other wholesale product lines, (ii) 0.5% from decreased freight, vehicle, and fuel costs and (iii) other individually immaterial factors representing a 0.2% favorable impact in the aggregate, partially offset by (iv) 0.4% from higher professional fees and (v) 0.2% from higher charitable contributions.

Parts and services revenue increased by $592 million, or 10.4%, to $6,303 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to (i) a parts and services organic revenue increase of 6.9% (7.4% on a per day basis), primarily driven by pricing initiatives across all geographies to offset increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures and to a lesser extent, higher volumes, (ii) an acquisition and divestiture revenue net increase of $76 million, or 1.3%, primarily related to our acquisition of seven wholesale businesses from the beginning of 2022 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition dates and (iii) an exchange rate increase of $121 million, or 2.1%, primarily due to the weaker U.S. dollar against the euro, Czech koruna and pound sterling for the year ended December 31, 2023 relative to the prior year. 
(2)
Gross margin increased by $222 million, or 10.0%, to $2,437 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Gross margin as a percent of total segment revenue was flat on a year to date basis, as favorable impacts from price increases were offset by inflationary pressures and difficult macro-economic conditions causing consumer price sensitivity, most notably in our Central and Eastern European regions.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $191 million, or 11.6%, to $1,842 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

(2)
Gross margin decreased by $91 million, or 17.4%, to $430 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Gross margin as a percent of total segment revenue decreased primarily due to product channel mix toward lower margin auto and marine products and increased competitive pricing due to broader availability of inventory among competitors in the market.
(3)
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $20 million, or 6.4%, to $305 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Parts and services organic revenue increased by $5 million, or 2.4%, to $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by pricing initiatives which focused on offsetting inflation on input costs resulting from greater competition for vehicles.
(2)
Other revenue decreased by $123 million, or 25.2%, to $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by an other organic decrease of $93 million, or 19.1%, due to (i) a $79 million decrease in revenue from precious metals (platinum, palladium, and rhodium) due to lower prices, (ii) a $20 million decrease in revenue from scrap steel related to lower prices and lower volumes, partially offset by (iii) a $6 million increase in revenue from other scrap (e.g., aluminum) and cores primarily related to higher volumes, partially offset by lower prices. Additionally, acquisition and divestiture other revenue was a net decrease of $30 million, or 6.1%, due to the divestiture of a business in the third quarter of 2022. See "Other Divestitures (Not Classified in Discontinued Operations)" in Note 4, "Discontinued Operations and Divestitures" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the divestiture.
(3)
Gross margin decreased by $56 million, or 20.0%, to $222 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to an unfavorable impact resulting from vehicle procurement costs decreasing at a lesser rate than commodity prices. Decreases in precious metals prices contributed an estimated $60 million decline in gross margin relative to the year ended December 31, 2022. Net sequential changes in scrap steel prices partially offset the impact of the decline in precious metals prices. During the year ended December 31, 2023, scrap steel prices had a $5 million favorable impact on gross margin compared to a $15 million unfavorable impact during the year ended December 31, 2022. The favorable impacts for the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted from the increase in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased a vehicle, which influences the price we pay for a vehicle, and the date we scrapped a vehicle, which influences the price we receive for scrapping a vehicle.
(4)
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $8 million, or 3.9%, to $188 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of total segment revenue was primarily due to a negative leverage effect of 5.7% from decreases in metals revenue, partially offset by other individually immaterial factors representing a 1.5% favorable impact in the aggregate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We assess our liquidity and capital resources in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facilities. We utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures, with the excess amounts going towards paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, paying down outstanding debt, or funding acquisitions. As we have pursued acquisitions as part of our historical growth strategy, our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities. To fund our acq
uisitions, we have accessed various forms of debt 
44
financing, including revolving credit facilities, term loans, and senior notes. We currently believe we have sufficient access to capital markets to support our future growth objectives.

n available liquidity, an increase of 
$181 million
 from our
 available liquidity as of December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of reducing our revolving credit facilities borrowings by $250 million. 
See Note 18, "Long-Term Obligations" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for information regarding total debt outstanding.

We believe that our current liquidity, cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods and access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements. Our capital allocation strategy includes spending to support growth driven capital projects, return stockholder value through the payment of dividends and repurchasing shares of our common stock, completing highly synergistic tuck-in acquisitions and debt repayment. 
See Part II, Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding
 the dividend activity for our common stock for the 
year ended
 December 31, 2024
.
On February 18, 2025, our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock, payable on March 27, 2025, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 13, 2025
. 
We believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to continue paying dividends in future periods; however, the timing, amount and frequency of such future dividends will be subject to approval by our Board, and based on considerations of capital availability, and various other factors, many of which are outside of our control.

With $1,456 million of total liquidity as of December 31, 2024 and $38 million of current maturities, we have access to funds to meet our near term commitments. We have a surplus of current assets over current liabilities, which further reduces the risk of short-term cash shortfalls. 
O
ur Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement and our CAD Note both include two financial maintenance covenants: a maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio. The terms maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio are specifically calculated per both the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement and CAD Note, and differ in specified ways from comparable GAAP or common usage terms. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under both our Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement and CAD Note as of 
December 31, 2024
. The required debt covenants per both the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement and CAD Note and our actual ratios with respect to those covenants are as follows as of 
December 31, 2024

The indentures relating to our U.S. Notes and Euro Notes d
o not include financial maintenance covenants, and the indentures will not restrict our ability to draw funds under the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement. The indentures do not prohibit amendments to the financial covenants under the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement and CAD Note as needed.
45
While we believe that we have adequate capacity under our existing revolving credit facilities to finance our current operations, from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or modification of our existing Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement to finance additional investments or to refinance existing debt obligations. There can be no assurance that additional funding, or refinancing of our Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs. Our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
As part of our effort to improve our operating cash flows, we may negotiate payment term extensions with suppliers. These efforts are supported by our supply chain finance programs. See Note 17, "Supply Chain Financing" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our supply chain financing arrangements.
We hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings. After giving effect to these contracts outstanding, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement was 5.8% at 
December 31, 2024
. Including our senior notes and CAD Note, our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 5.3% at 
December 31, 2024
. Under the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, our borrowings bear interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (i.e., SOFR) plus the applicable spread or other risk-free interest rates that are applicable for the specified currency plus a spread. Under the CAD Note, the interest rate may be (i) a forward-looking term rate based on the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average ("CORRA") for an interest period chosen by the Company of one or three months or (ii) the Canadian Prime Rate (as defined in the CAD Note), plus in each case a spread. See Note 18, "Long-Term Obligations" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our borrowings and related interest. The interest rate swaps are described in Note 19, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We had outstanding borrowin
gs under our revolving credit facilities and term loans payable of $1,651 million 
and 
$1,943 million
 at 
December 31, 2024
 and 2023, respectively. Of these amounts
, there were no current maturities at

December 31, 2024
 or 2023.
See Note 18, "Long-Term Obligations" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for information regarding the
 scheduled maturities of long-term obligations outstanding
.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 
$234 million
, of which $213 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. In general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the U.S. without repatriating our foreign earnings. We may, from time to time, choose to selectively repatriate foreign earnings if doing so supports our financing or liquidity objectives. Distributions of dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, if any, would be generally exempt from further U.S. taxation, either as a result of the 100% participation exemption under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, or due to the previous taxation of foreign earnings under the transition tax and the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income regime ("GILTI").
The procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds. We normally pay for aftermarket product purchases on standard payment terms or at the time of shipment, depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms. We normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,121 million compared to $1,356 million for the same period of 2023. Cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases, payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period.

Inventories represented $324 million in incremental cash outflows for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Accounts payable produced $256 million in incremental cash inflows for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Other operating activities primarily reflect the aggregate effect of lower cash earnings, higher interest payments (primarily due to additional borrowings for the Uni-Select Acquisition and higher interest rates), and higher cash paid for taxes during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023.
46
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities totaled $406 million compared to $2,442 million for the same period of 2023. We invested $49 million and $2,225 million of cash in business acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of businesses, net of divested cash were an outflow of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to an inflow of $110 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to the sale of GSF Car Parts. Property, plant and equipment purchases were $311 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $358 million in the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we settled our foreign exchange forward contracts related to the Uni-Select purchase price with the counterparties and received

$49 million due primarily to strengthening in the Canadian exchange rate relative to the contract rates.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities totaled $746 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,102 million
 for the same period of 
2023. The decrease is primarily due to proceeds (net of unamortized bond discounts) of $1,394 million from the issuance of the U.S. Notes (2028/33) in 2023. Cash outflows for share repurchases were $360 million and dividends paid were $318 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $38 million for share repurchases and $302 million for dividends paid for the same period of 2023. Net debt payments (net of unamortized bond discounts) were $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to net debt borrowings (net of unamortized bond discounts) of $111 million for the same period of 2023 (excluding proceeds from the issuance of the U.S. Notes (2028/33) of $1,394 million).
We intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers, processing and sales facilities, and warehouses, through further integration of our facilities, and through selected business acquisitions. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts.
We have various contractual obligations and commitments arising in the normal course of business. The following represent our anticipated material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024.
•
Long-term debt of $4,198 million and related interest totaling $914 million, of which $38 million and $223 million, respectively, is expected to be paid within twelve months. See Note 18, "Long-Term Obligations" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to debt amounts outstanding at December 31, 2024. 
•
Operating lease payments of $1,838 million, of which $333 million is expected to be paid within twelve months. See Note 21, "Leases" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to lease amounts outstanding at December 31, 2024.
•
Purchase obligations of $693 million for open purchase orders for aftermarket inventory all expected to be paid within twelve months.
•
Net pension obligations of $84 million, of which $8 million is expected to be paid within twelve months. Benefit payments for our funded plans will be made from plan assets, whereas benefit payments for our unfunded plans are made from cash flows from operating activities. See Note 22, "Employee Benefit Plans" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to net pension obligations at December 31, 2024. 
•
Self-insurance reserves of $144 million, of which

$79 million is expected to be paid within twelve months. See Note 7, "Self-Insurance Reserves" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to self-insurance reserves at December 31, 2024.

Summarized Guarantor Financial Information
Our U.S. Notes (2028/2033) and Euro Notes (2031) are guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by certain of our subsidiaries (each, a “subsidiary guarantor” and, together with LKQ, the “Obligor Group”), which are listed in Exhibit 22.1 in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The guarantees are full and unconditional, joint and several, and subject to certain conditions for release. See Note 18, "Long-Term Obligations" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to the Euro Notes (2031) and U.S. Notes (2028/2033).
Holders of the notes have a direct claim only against the Obligor Group. The following summarized financial information is presented for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances within the Obligor Group and equity in the earnings from and investments in any non-guarantor subsidiary.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:
•
foreign exchange rates;
•
interest rates;
•
commodity prices; and
•
inflation.
Foreign Exchange Rates
Foreign currency fluctuations may impact the financial results we report for the portions of our business that operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our operations outside of the U.S. represented 52.4% and 50.8% of our revenue during years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. An increase or decrease in the strength of the U.S. dollar against these currencies by 10% would result in a 5.2% change in our consolidated revenue and a 3.7% change in our operating income for the year ended December 31, 2024. See our Results of Operations discussion in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our year over year results.
48
Additionally, we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket products from foreign countries, primarily in Europe and Asia. To the extent that our inventory purchases are not denominated in the functional currency of the purchasing location, we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. In several of our operations, we purchase inventory from manufacturers in Taiwan in U.S. dollars, which exposes us to fluctuations in the relationship between the local functional currency and the U.S. dollar, as well as fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Taiwan dollar. We hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations related to a portion of inventory purchases in our Europe operations, but the notional amount and fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2024 were immaterial. We do not currently attempt to hedge foreign currency exposure related to our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases in our Wholesale - North America operations, and we may not be able to pass on any resulting price increases to our customers.
To the extent that we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to non-functional currency denominated transactions, we may hedge the exposure through the use of foreign currency forward contracts. In March 2023, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts related to the Uni-Select Acquisition. These contracts were settled in July 2023 ahead of closing of the Uni-Select Acquisition. See Note 3, "Business Combinations" and Note 19, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Other than with respect to a portion of our foreign currency denominated inventory purchases and, from time to time, certain financing transactions, we do not hold derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency risk. Our net investment in foreign operations is partially hedged by the foreign currency denominated borrowings we use to fund foreign acquisitions; however, our ability to use foreign currency denominated borrowings to finance our foreign operations may be limited based on local tax laws. We have elected not to hedge the foreign currency risk related to the interest payments on foreign third party borrowings as we generate cash flows in the local currencies that can be used to fund debt payments. As of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of €250 million under our Euro Notes (2028), €750 million under our Euro Notes (2031), CAD 700 million under our CAD Note, and Swedish Krona ("SEK") 25 million under our revolving credit facilities. As of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding borrowings of €500 million under our Euro Notes (2024) and €250 million under our Euro Notes (2028), CAD 700 million under our CAD Note, and €344 million and SEK

60 million under our revolving credit facilities.
Interest Rates
Our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facilities, where interest rates are tied to SOFR, prime rate, CORRA, Euro Interbank Offered Rate, SONIA, or Swiss Average Rate Overnight. Therefore, we implemented a policy to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on a portion of our outstanding variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swap contracts. These contracts effectively converted a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. We designated our interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges, and net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swap contracts are included as adjustments to interest expense.
In February 2023, we entered into two sets of interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings. See Note 18, "Long-Term Obligations" and Note 19, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
At December 31, 2024, we had approximately $951 million of variable rate debt that was not hedged. Using sensitivity analysis, a 100 basis point movement in interest rates would change interest expense by $10 million over the next twelve months. 
Commodity Prices
We are exposed to market risk related to price fluctuations in scrap metal and other metals (including precious metals, such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium, contained in some recycled parts, such as catalytic converters). Market prices of these metals affect the amount that we pay for our inventory and the revenue that we generate from sales of these metals. As both our revenue and costs are affected by the price fluctuations, we have a natural hedge against the changes. However, there is typically a lag between the effect on our revenue from metal price fluctuations and inventory cost changes, and there is no guarantee that the vehicle costs will decrease or increase at the same rate as the metals prices. Therefore, we can experience positive or negative gross margin effects in periods of rising or falling metals prices, particularly when such prices move rapidly. Additionally, if market prices were to change at a higher or lower rate than our vehicle acquisition costs, we could experience a positive or negative effect on our operating margin. The average of scrap metal prices for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased by 5% over the average for 2023, noting prices decreased over both years. The average prices of 
49
palladium, rhodium and platinum decreased by 26%, 23% and 2%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the average prices for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Inflation
We are exposed to market risks related to inflation in product, labor, shipping, freight and general overhead costs. In 2023, inflation increased to rates beyond recent history, which resulted in rising costs, but started to ease in 2024. We adjusted our prices and drove productivity initiatives to partially mitigate the inflationary effects. If these pressures continue or increase in severity, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases and productivity initiatives. Inflationary pressures in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs, we cannot identify cost efficiencies, or the higher prices impact demand.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of LKQ Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Goodwill Impairment Assessment - Refer to Notes 2  and 9 to the financial statements.
Critical Audit Matter Description 
The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and the market approach, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. 
Auditing the estimates and assumptions that impacted the valuation of certain reporting units involved especially subjective judgment; specifically, the forecasts of future revenue and profit margins (“forecasts”), the selection of discount rates, and the determination of market multiples.
52
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
Our audit procedures related to the forecasts, the selection of discount rates, and determination of market multiples included the following, among others: 
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the goodwill impairment assessments, including those over the forecasts and the selection of the discount rates and the market multiples. 
•
We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts. 
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical results, (2) internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, (3) analyst and industry reports of the Company and companies in its peer group, and (4) forecasts used in the preceding impairment assessments. 
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the discount rates, including (1) testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, (2) developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates used by management, and (3) comparing the discount rates used by management to those used in the preceding impairment assessments. 
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the market multiples, including testing the underlying source information and mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and comparing the multiples selected by management to its guideline public companies and the multiples used in the preceding impairment assessments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of LKQ Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. 
Business
Description of Business
LKQ Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is a holding company and all operations are conducted by subsidiaries. When the terms "LKQ," "the Company," "we," "us," or "our" are used in this document, those terms refer to LKQ Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We are a global distributor of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty aftermarket products and accessories designed to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles. We operate in the United States, Canada, Germany, the U.K., the Benelux region (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg), Italy, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, France and various other European countries.
We are organized into four operating segments: Wholesale - North America; Europe; Specialty; and Self Service, each of which is presented as a reportable segment.
Note 2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of LKQ Corporation and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency Translation
Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. For most of our international operations, the local currency is the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the period-ending exchange rate. Statements of Income amounts are translated to U.S. dollars using monthly average exchange rates during the period. Translation gains and losses are reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when a sales arrangement with a customer exists (e.g., contract, purchase orders, others), the transaction price is fixed or determinable and we have satisfied its performance obligations per the sales arrangement. The majority of our revenue originates from contracts with a single performance obligation to deliver parts, whereby the performance obligation is satisfied when control of the parts is transferred to the customer per the arranged shipping terms. Some of our contracts contain a combination of delivering parts and performing services, which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue for the service component is recognized as the services are rendered.
60
LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our revenue is measured at the determinable transaction price, net of any variable considerations granted to customers. Variable considerations include the right to return parts, discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, or other similar items. These variable considerations are estimated throughout the year based on various factors, including contract terms, historical experience and performance levels. 
Sales tax and other tax amounts collected from customers for remittance to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are shown as a current liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until remitted.
Any incremental costs to obtain a contract (commissions earned by our sales representatives on product sales) are expensed when incurred, as the amortization period of the asset would be one year or less due to the short-term nature of our contracts.
Cost of Goods Sold 
Cost of goods sold includes: the price we pay for inventory, net of vendor discounts, rebates or other incentives; inbound freight and other transportation costs to bring inventory into our facilities; and overhead costs related to purchasing, warehousing and transporting our products from our distribution warehouses to our selling locations. For our salvage, remanufactured, refurbished and manufactured products, cost of goods sold also includes direct and indirect labor, equipment costs, depreciation, and other overhead to transform inventory into finished products suitable for sale. Cost of goods sold also includes expenses for service-type and assurance-type warranty programs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses include: personnel costs for employees in SG&A functions; costs to operate branch locations, corporate offices and back office support centers; costs to transport products from facilities to our customers; and other expenses, such as professional fees, supplies, and advertising expenses. The costs included in SG&A expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities, and, as such, are classified below Gross margin in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Stock-Based Compensation
For the restricted stock units ("RSUs") that contain both a performance-based vesting condition and a time-based vesting condition, we recognize compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method, pursuant to which expense is recognized straight-line over the requisite service period for each separate vesting tranche of the award. For all other awards, which are subject to only a time-based vesting condition, we recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award. 
For performance-based RSUs ("PSUs"), the expense is calculated using the projected award value, which is based on an estimate of the achievement of the performance objectives, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the performance period. 
The impacts of forfeitures on RSUs and PSUs expense are recorded as they occur.
Income Taxes
Current income taxes are provided on income reported for financial reporting purposes, adjusted for transactions that do not enter into the computation of income taxes payable in the same year. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or that future deductibility is uncertain. Provision is made for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be permanently invested.
We recognize the benefits of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns in the provision for income taxes only for those positions that are more likely than not to be realized. We follow a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions 
61
LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. Our policy is to include any interest and penalties associated with income tax obligations in income tax expense.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, and deposits readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Restricted cash includes any cash that is legally or contractually restricted as to withdrawal or usage.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Receivables are reported net of an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is measured on a pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist, and a loss-rate for each pool is determined using historical credit loss experience as the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current conditions (e.g., management's evaluation of the aging of customer receivable balances and the financial condition of our customers) as well as changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions, such as changes in the unemployment rate, gross domestic product growth rate or credit default rates.

Concentrations of Credit Risks
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and receivables. We control our exposure to credit risk associated with these instruments by (i) placing cash and cash equivalents with several major financial institutions; (ii) holding high-quality financial instruments; and (iii) maintaining strict policies over credit extension that include credit evaluations, credit limits and monitoring procedures. In addition, our overall credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to some extent because our customer base is composed of a large number of geographically diverse customers.
Inventories 
Our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value can be influenced by current anticipated demand. If actual demand is lower than our estimates, additional reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made. 
The cost of our inventory is determined differently based on the category of inventory; (i) aftermarket and refurbished products, (ii) salvage and remanufactured products, and (iii) manufactured products. 
An aftermarket product is a new vehicle product manufactured by a company other than the original equipment manufacturer. For aftermarket products, cost is established based on the average price paid for parts. Inventory cost for aftermarket products includes expenses incurred for freight in and overhead costs; for items purchased from foreign companies, import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included. Refurbished products are parts that require cosmetic repairs, such as wheels, bumper covers and lights; we will apply new parts, products or materials to these parts to produce the finished product. Refurbished inventory cost is based upon the average price we pay for cores, which are recycled automotive parts that are not suitable for sale as a replacement part without further processing. The cost of refurbished inventory also includes expenses incurred for freight in, labor and other overhead costs. 
A salvage product is a recycled vehicle part suitable for sale as a replacement part. Salvage product cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle, including auction, storage and towing fees, as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling the vehicle. Inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility's inventory at expected selling prices, the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based on a part's number of days in stock and historical demand. The average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility's historical profitability for salvage vehicles. Remanufactured products are used parts that have been inspected, rebuilt, or reconditioned to restore functionality and performance, such as remanufactured engines and transmissions. Remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores and expenses incurred for freight in, direct manufacturing costs and other overhead costs. 
A manufactured product is a new vehicle product. Manufactured product inventory can be a raw material, work-in-process or finished good. Manufactured product cost is established using the first-in first-out method.
62
LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Property, Plant and Equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the term of the related lease and reasonably assured renewal periods, if shorter. Depreciation expense associated with refurbishing, remanufacturing, manufacturing and furnace operations as well as distribution centers are recorded in Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Depreciation expense resulting from restructuring programs is recorded in Restructuring and transaction related expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. All other depreciation expense is reported in Depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Expenditures for major additions and improvements that extend the useful life of the related asset are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are recorded as incurred to SG&A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As property, plant and equipment are sold or retired, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss thereon is recognized. Construction in progress consists primarily of building and land improvements at our existing facilities.

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill (the cost of purchased businesses in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired) and other specifically identifiable intangible assets, such as customer and supplier relationships, trade names, trademarks, software and other technology related assets, and covenants not to compete.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. We performed annual impairment tests during the fourth quarters of 2024, 2023 and 2022. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing may also be performed on an interim basis when events or circumstances arise that may lead to impairment. The fair value estimates of our goodwill reporting units were established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach.
Based on the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2024, we determined no impairment existed. The goodwill reporting units had a fair value estimate which exceeded the carrying value by at least 
10
%.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception with lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease liabilities being recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. In determining the present value of future lease payments, we use the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. We determine the incremental borrowing rate by analyzing yield curves with consideration of lease term, country and Company specific factors. In assessing the ROU asset, we include any lease prepayments and deduct lease incentives. We account for the lease and non-lease components of a contract as a single lease component and for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, we have elected to not record an ROU asset and lease liability. In assessing the lease term, we include options to renew only when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. 
For certain lease agreements, rental payments are adjusted periodically for inflation. Typically, these adjustments are considered variable lease costs. Other variable lease costs consist of certain non-lease components that are disclosed as lease costs due to our election of the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components and include items such as variable payments for utilities, property taxes, common area maintenance, sales taxes, and insurance.
Net Assets Held for Sale
We record net assets held for sale at the lower of fair value less cost to sell or carrying value. Fair values are based on projected discounted cash flows and/or estimated selling prices. Management's assumptions for the discounted cash flow analyses of the businesses are based on projected revenues and profits, tax rates, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and discount rates. For businesses for which we utilized estimated selling prices to calculate the fair value, the inputs to the estimates included projected market multiples and any reasonable offers. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in management's analysis. The inputs utilized in the fair value estimates are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the net assets were measured on a non-
63
LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
recurring basis as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, assets and liabilities held for sale were insignificant. In 2024, we divested certain operations in Slovenia, Poland and Bosnia. Our decision to exit these businesses, as well as other factors, constituted a triggering event to evaluate our net assets held for sale for impairment, and as a result, we incurred impairment charges related to these divestitures during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 13, "Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses" for further information related to these impairment charges. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded an insignificant amount of impairment on our net assets held for sale.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. As a result of the divestitures described in the "Net Assets Held for Sale" section above, we incurred impairment charges to the carrying value of long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 13, "Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses" for further information related to these impairment charges. There were no significant impairments to the carrying value of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.
Equity Method Investments
We account for our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting, as our investments give us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Under the equity method of accounting, the initial investment is recorded at cost and the investment is subsequently adjusted for our proportionate share of earnings or losses and dividends, including consideration of basis differences resulting from the difference between the initial carrying amount of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets, as applicable.

Warranty Reserve
Assurance-type warranties are not considered a separate performance obligation, and thus no transaction price is allocated to them. Our warranty reserve is calculated using historical claim information to project future warranty claims activity and is recorded within Other accrued expenses and Other noncurrent liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the expected timing to settle the warranty claims. We record warranty costs in Cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Self-Insurance Reserves
We self-insure a portion of our employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program. We purchase certain stop-loss insurance to limit our liability exposure. We also self-insure a portion of our property and casualty risk, which includes automobile liability, general liability, directors and officers liability, workers' compensation, and property coverage, under deductible insurance programs. The insurance premium costs are expensed over the contract periods. A reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported based upon our estimate of the ultimate cost, which is calculated using an analysis of historical data. We monitor new claim and claim developments as well as trends related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the adequacy of our insurance reserves. The current portion of total self-insurance reserves is recorded in Other accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the noncurrent portion is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which reflects management's estimates of when claims will be paid.
Litigation and Related Contingencies
We have certain contingencies resulting from litigation, claims and other commitments and are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations incident to the ordinary course of business. We currently expect that the resolution of such contingencies will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Treasury Stock
We record common stock purchased for treasury stock at cost. The excise tax on share repurchases initiated on and after January 1, 2023 is included in the cost basis of treasury stock.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
During the first quarter of 2023, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-04, "Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations" ("ASU 2022-04"), which requires the buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose certain information about its program, including key terms, balance sheet presentation of amounts, outstanding amounts at the end of each period, and rollforwards of balances. We adopted the provisions of ASU 2022-04 on a retrospective basis, except for the disclosure of rollforward information, which was adopted prospectively for the year ended December 31, 2024 as required. The adoption of ASU 2022-04 did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows but did result in additional disclosures.
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" (ASU 2023-07). The ASU expands public entities' segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. We adopted the ASU on a retrospective basis beginning in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows but did result in additional disclosures. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures." The ASU requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires prospective application with the option to apply it retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2024-03, “Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.” The ASU requires disclosure of specific expense categories within relevant income statement captions. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. The ASU can be adopted prospectively or retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.

Business Combinations
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we completed acquisitions of 
eight
 businesses within our Wholesale - North America segment and 
two
 businesses within our Europe segment. These acquisitions were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Additionally, in January 2024, we paid $
23
 million (€
21
 million) to a minority shareholder to settle a put option exercised on redeemable shares issued in conjunction with a previous acquisition. This payment was presented within Other financing activities, net in financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
On February 26, 2023, we entered into a plan of arrangement to acquire all of Uni-Select's issued and outstanding shares. On August 1, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Uni-Select for an aggregate consideration paid of approximately Canadian dollar (“CAD”) 
2.8
 billion ($
2.1
 billion) (the "Uni-Select Acquisition"). In order to reduce the risk related to changes in CAD foreign exchange rates for the CAD purchase price, we entered into foreign exchange contracts. These foreign exchange contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting, and therefore the changes in fair value were reported in Gains on foreign exchange contracts - acquisition related in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We reported Gains on foreign exchange contracts - acquisition related of

$
49
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. These foreign exchange contracts were settled in July 2023 ahead of closing of the Uni-Select Acquisition, resulting in total payments received of $
49
 million. See Note 19, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" for information related to these foreign exchange contracts. This acquisition complemented our existing North American paint distribution operations and provided a scaled position in the Canadian replacement and maintenance parts market, with opportunity for future consolidation and growth.

LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In addition to our acquisition of Uni-Select, we completed acquisitions of 
three
 businesses within our Wholesale - North America segment, 
four
 businesses within our Europe segment and 
one
 business in our Specialty segment, during the year ended December 31, 2023.
Our acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition. The purchase prices were allocated to the net assets based upon estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2024, there have been no significant adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocations from those disclosed in our December 31, 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements.
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the effect of the businesses acquired during the year ended December 31, 2024 as though the businesses had been acquired as of January 1, 2023. The unaudited pro forma financial information is based upon accounting estimates and judgments that we believe are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma financial information includes the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, such as the adjustment of inventory acquired to fair value, adjustments to depreciation on acquired property, plant and equipment, adjustments to rent expense for above or below market leases, adjustments to amortization on acquired intangible assets, adjustments to interest expense, and the related tax effects. These pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred if the acquisitions had been in effect for the periods presented or of future results.

Note 4. 
Discontinued Operations and Divestitures
GSF C
ar Parts
As part of the Uni-Select transaction, we were required to divest its U.K. subsidiary, GSF Car Parts, to comply with the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority regulatory ruling. Since the GSF Car Parts business was held separate and never integrated into our business, we classified the business as discontinued operations upon acquisition.
On October 25, 2023, we divested GSF Car Parts to a third party for $
110
 million of proceeds, net of cash divested, resulting in an immaterial loss on sale. The proceeds were used for repayments on our revolving credit facilities. In order to manage our exposure to variability in the cash flows related to the sale of GSF Car Parts, we entered into a foreign exchange forward contract to fix the amount of USD we received upon completion of the sale. This foreign exchange contract was settled in October 2023. 
Glass Manufacturing Business
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded to discontinued operations a $
5
 million benefit primarily related to the reassessment of a previously recorded valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to our glass manufacturing business sold in 2017.
Other Divestitures (Not Classified in Discontinued Operations)
In 2024, we divested certain operations in Slovenia, Poland and Bosnia. See Note 13, "Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses" for further information related to these divestitures.

Revenue Recognition
Disaggregated Revenue
We report revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other.
Parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty products and accessories to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles. Services revenue includes (i) additional services that are generally billed concurrently with the related product sales, such as the sale of service-type warranties, (ii) fees for admission to our self service yards, and (iii) diagnostic and repair services. 
69
LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For Wholesale - North America and Self Service, vehicle replacement products include sheet metal collision parts such as doors, hoods, and fenders; bumper covers; head and tail lamps; mirrors; grilles; wheels; and large mechanical items such as engines and transmissions. For Europe, and to a lesser extent for Wholesale - North America, vehicle replacement products include a wide variety of small mechanical products such as brake pads, discs and sensors; clutches; electrical products such as spark plugs and batteries; steering and suspension products; filters; and oil and automotive fluids. Additionally, in both our Wholesale - North America and Europe segments, we sell paint and paint related consumables for refinishing vehicles. For our Specialty operations, we serve seven product segments: truck and off-road; speed and performance; recreational vehicles; towing; wheels, tires and performance handling; marine; and miscellaneous accessories.
Other revenue includes sales of scrap and precious metals (platinum, palladium, and rhodium), bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers (including cores) and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from furnace operations. We derive scrap metal and other precious metals from several sources in both our Wholesale - North America and Self Service segments, including vehicles that have been used in our recycling operations and vehicles from OEMs and other entities that contract with us for secure disposal of "crush only" vehicles. Revenue from the sale of hulks in our Wholesale - North America and Self Service segments is recognized based on a price per ton of delivered material when the customer (processor) collects the scrap.

Restructuring and Transaction Related Expenses
From time to time, we initiate restructuring plans to integrate acquired businesses, to align our workforce with strategic business activities, or to improve efficiencies in our operations. Below is a summary of our current restructuring plans:
2024 Global Restructuring Plan
In the first quarter of 2024, we began a global restructuring initiative focused on enhancing profitability. This initiative includes exiting businesses and markets that do not align with our strategic objectives and executing on opportunities to reduce costs, streamline operations and consolidate facilities. As we continue to move forward with our plan, we have incurred and expect to incur impairments and other charges related to the disposal of long-lived assets, inventory, and other assets; costs for employee severance; lease termination charges and facility closure costs; and other contract termination charges. We expect that the largest portion of the activity will come from the Europe segment. In 2024, we divested our operations in Slovenia and Bosnia to third parties and, certain operations in Poland to Mekonomen, an equity method investment of which we own 
26.6
%, and received a combination of cash and notes receivable. Our decision to exit these markets constituted a triggering event to evaluate certain long-lived assets for impairment, and as a result, we incurred impairment charges with the divestitures of Slovenia, Poland, and Bosnia. This plan is scheduled to be substantially complete by the end of 2025 with an estimated total incurred cost of between $
130
 million and $
150
 million.
2022 Global Restructuring Plan
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began a restructuring initiative covering all of our reportable segments designed to reduce costs, streamline operations, consolidate facilities and implement other strategic changes to the overall organization. We have incurred costs primarily for employee severance, inventory or other asset write-downs, and exiting facilities. This plan was completed in 2024 with a total incurred cost of $
30
 million.
1 LKQ Europe Plan
In 2019, we announced a multi-year plan called "1 LKQ Europe" which is intended to create structural centralization and standardization of key functions to facilitate the operation of the Europe segment as a single business. Under the 1 LKQ Europe plan, we are reorganizing our non-customer-facing teams and support systems through various projects including the implementation of a common Enterprise Resource Planning platform, rationalization of our product portfolio, and creation of a Europe headquarters office and central back office. We completed the organizational design and implementation projects in June 2021, with the remaining projects scheduled to be completed by the end of 2027 with a total incurred cost of between $
30
 million and $
40
 million.
Acquisition Integration Plans
After completing the acquisition of a business, we may incur costs related to integrating the acquired business into our current business structure and systems. These costs are typically incurred within a year from the acquisition date and vary in magnitude depending on the size and complexity of the related integration activities. We substantially completed the integration plan in 2024 related to the Uni-Select Acquisition in our Wholesale - North America segment.

LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 14. 
Stock-Based Compensation
In order to attract and retain employees, non-employee directors, consultants, and other persons associated with the Company, we grant equity-based awards under the LKQ Corporation 1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Incentive Plan”). The total number of shares approved by stockholders for issuance under the Equity Incentive Plan is 
70
 million shares, subject to anti-dilution and other adjustment provisions. We have granted RSUs, stock options, and restricted stock under the Equity Incentive Plan. Of the shares approved by stockholders for issuance under the Equity Incentive Plan, 
6.9
 million shares remained available for issuance as of December 31, 2024. We expect to issue new or treasury shares of common stock to cover past and future equity grants.
RSUs 
The RSUs we have issued vest over periods of up to 
five years
, subject to a continued service condition. Currently outstanding RSUs (other than PSUs, which are described below) contain either a time-based vesting condition or a combination of a performance-based vesting condition and a time-based vesting condition, in which case both conditions must be met before any RSUs vest. For all of the RSUs containing a performance-based vesting condition, we must report positive diluted earnings per share, subject to certain adjustments, during any fiscal year period within 
five years
 following the grant date. Each RSU converts into one share of LKQ common stock on the applicable vesting date. The grant date fair value of RSUs is based on the market price of LKQ stock on the grant date.
Participants who are eligible for retirement (defined as a voluntary separation of service from the Company after the participant has attained at least 60 years of age and completed at least five years of service) will continue to vest in their awards following retirement; if retirement occurs during the first year of the vesting period (for RSUs subject to a time-based vesting condition) or the first year of the performance period (for RSUs with a performance-based vesting condition), the participant vests in a prorated amount of the RSU grant based on the portion of the year employed.
Outstanding unvested RSUs earn dividend equivalents at the same rate as dividends on LKQ’s common stock. The dividend equivalents are subject to the same vesting requirements, restrictions and forfeiture provisions as the original award.
The Compensation and Human Capital Committee of our Board approved the grant of 
228,570
, 
169,511
, and 
169,605
 RSUs to our executives that included both a performance-based vesting condition and a time-based vesting condition in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The performance-based vesting conditions for the 2024, 2023, and 2022 grants to our executive officers have been satisfied.
The fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $
31
 million, $
38
 million, and $
38
 million, respectively; the fair value of RSUs vested is based on the market price of LKQ stock on the date vested.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PSUs
We grant PSUs with a 
three-year
 performance period to certain employees, including executive officers, under our Equity Incentive Plan. As these awards are performance-based, the exact number of shares to be paid out may be up to twice the grant amount, depending on our performance and the achievement of certain performance metrics (adjusted earnings per share, average organic parts and services revenue growth, and average return on invested capital) over the applicable three year performance periods.
Outstanding unvested PSUs earn dividend equivalents at the same rate as dividends on LKQ's common stock. The dividend equivalents are subject to the same vesting requirements, restrictions and forfeiture provisions as the original award.
The fair value of PSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
11
 million, $
13
 million, and $
9

Note 15. 
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share incorporate the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and the assumed vesting of RSUs. Certain of our RSUs and stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were antidilutive, but these equity instruments could be dilutive in the future.

Our policy is to reclassify the income tax effect from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the Provision for income taxes when the related gains and losses are released to the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Note 17. 
Supply Chain Financing
We utilize voluntary supply chain finance programs to support our efforts in negotiating payment term extensions with suppliers as part of our effort to improve our operating cash flows. These programs provide participating suppliers the opportunity to sell their LKQ receivables to financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions. We are not a party to the agreement between the suppliers and financial institutions. The financial institutions participate in the supply chain financing initiative on an uncommitted basis and can cease purchasing receivables from our suppliers at any time. Our obligation to our suppliers, including amount due and payment date, are not impacted by the supplier’s decision to sell amounts under these agreements. Our payment terms to the financial institutions, including the timing and amount of payments, are unchanged from the original supplier invoice. All outstanding payments owed under the supply chain finance programs with the participating financial institutions are recorded within Accounts payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $
416
 million and $
411
 million of 
Accounts payable
 outstanding under the arrangements, respectively.

Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement
On January 5, 2023, we and certain other subsidiaries of ours entered into a new credit agreement (the "Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement") which consists of (i) an unsecured revolving credit facility of up to a U.S. Dollar equivalent of $
2.0
 billion, which includes a $
150
 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $
150
 million sublimit for swing line loans and (ii) an unsecured term loan facility of up to $
500
 million. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (i.e. "SOFR") plus the applicable spread or other risk-free interest rates that are applicable for the specified currency plus a spread based on the Company's debt rating and total leverage ratio. On June 5, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement which replaced the Canadian Dollar Offer Rate ("CDOR") with the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average ("CORRA") for CAD denominated borrowings. The maturity date of the term loan is January 5, 2026 and may be extended by one additional year subject to agreement by the lenders. The term loan has no required amortization payments prior to its maturity date. The maturity date for the revolving credit facility is January 5, 2028, and may be extended by up to two additional years in one year increments. 
The Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement contains customary covenants for an unsecured credit facility for a company that has debt ratings that are investment grade, such as, requirements to comply with a total leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio, each calculated in accordance with the terms of the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, and limits on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens and indebtedness.
Proceeds from the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement were used to repay the outstanding principal amount under our prior Senior Secured Credit Agreement ("Prior Credit Agreement"), to pay fees and expenses related to the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, and for other general corporate purposes.
Senior Unsecured Term Loan Credit Agreement
For the permanent financing related to the Uni-Select Acquisition, on March 27, 2023, we entered into the Senior Unsecured Term Loan Agreement ("CAD Note") which established an unsecured term loan facility of up to CAD 
700
 million maturing in July 2026. The CAD Note was funded on July 31, 2023, which was one business day prior to the consummation of the Uni-Select Acquisition.
The CAD Note contains customary covenants for an unsecured term loan for a company that has debt ratings that are investment grade, such as requirements to comply with a total leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio, each calculated in accordance with the terms of the CAD Note, and limits on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur liens and indebtedness.
On June 12, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the CAD Note which replaced CDOR with CORRA. The variable interest rate applicable to the CAD Note may be (i) a forward-looking term rate based on CORRA for an interest period chosen by the Company of one or three months or (ii) the Canadian Prime Rate (as defined in the CAD Note), plus in each case a spread based on the Company’s debt rating and total leverage ratio. 
U.S. Notes (2028/2033)
On May 24, 2023, as part of the financing for the Uni-Select Acquisition, we completed an offering of $
1,400
 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $
800
 million senior notes due 2028 (the "U.S. Notes (2028)") and $
600
 million senior notes due 2033 (the "U.S. Notes (2033)" and together with the U.S. Notes (2028), the "U.S. Notes (2028/33)") in a private placement conducted pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933. 
The U.S. Notes (2028/33) are governed by the Indenture, dated as of May 24, 2023 (the "Indenture"), among the Company, certain of the Company's subsidiaries (the "Guarantors") and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The U.S. Notes (2028/33) will be initially fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that are guarantors under our Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated as of January 5, 2023, or the CAD Note and each of our domestic subsidiaries that in the future agrees to guarantee obligations under the Senior 
78
LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Unsecured Credit Agreement, the CAD Note, any other Credit Facility Debt or any Capital Markets Debt (as such terms are defined in the Indenture).
Each subsidiary guarantee will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future liabilities of the applicable subsidiary guarantor that are not subordinated. Each subsidiary guarantee will effectively rank junior to any secured indebtedness of its respective subsidiary guarantor to the extent of the lesser of the amount of such secured indebtedness and the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. Under the terms of any subsidiary guarantee, holders of the U.S. Notes (2028/33) will not be required to exercise their remedies against us before they proceed directly against the subsidiary guarantors.
Prior to May 15, 2028 in the case of the U.S. Notes (2028) or March 15, 2033 in the case of the U.S. Notes (2033) (each such date a "Par Call Date"), we may redeem the U.S. Notes (2028) or U.S. Notes (2033), as applicable, at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming, in each case, that such U.S. Notes (2028/33) matured on their applicable Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 40 basis points in the case of the U.S. Notes (2028) or 45 basis points in the case of the U.S. Notes (2033), less interest accrued to the date of redemption; and (ii) 
100
% of the principal amount of the U.S. Notes (2028/33) to be redeemed; plus in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding the redemption date. On or after the applicable Par Call Date we may redeem the U.S. Notes (2028/33) of the applicable series, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the U.S. Notes (2028/33) being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date.
In connection with the sale of the U.S. Notes (2028/33), we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of May 24, 2023 (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), with the Guarantors and BofA Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the initial purchasers of the U.S. Notes (2028/33) identified therein. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, on September 1, 2023, the Company and the Guarantors filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 ("Form S-4") with respect to a registered offer to exchange (the "Exchange Offer") each series of U.S. Notes (2028/33) and related guarantees for new notes of such series (the "Exchange Notes") and new related guarantees, which has terms substantially identical in all material respects to the applicable series of U.S. Notes (2028/33) (except that the Exchange Notes do not contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions and Additional Interest). The SEC declared the Form S-4 effective on September 14, 2023. The Exchange Offer closed in the fourth quarter of 2023.
The U.S. Notes (2028) and U.S. Notes (2033) bear interest at rates of 
5.75
% and 
6.25
%, respectively, per year from the date of original issuance or from the most recent payment date on which interest has been paid or provided for. Interest on the U.S. Notes (2028/33) is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2023.

Euro Notes (2026/2028)
On April 9, 2018, LKQ European Holdings B.V. ("LKQ Euro Holdings"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of LKQ Corporation, completed an offering of €
1,000
 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The offering consisted of €
750
 million senior notes due 2026 (the "Euro Notes (2026)") and €
250
 million senior notes due 2028 (the "Euro Notes (2028)" and, together with the Euro Notes (2026), the "Euro Notes (2026/28)") in a private placement conducted pursuant to Regulation S and Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The proceeds from the offering, together with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, were used (i) to finance a portion of the consideration paid for the Stahlgruber acquisition, (ii) for general corporate purposes and (iii) to pay related fees and expenses, including the refinancing of net financial debt. The Euro Notes (2026/28) are governed by the Indenture dated as of April 9, 2018 (the “Euro Notes (2026/28) Indenture”) among LKQ Euro Holdings, LKQ Corporation and certain of our subsidiaries (the “Euro Notes (2026/28) Subsidiaries”), the trustee, paying agent, transfer agent, and registrar. On April 1, 2021, we redeemed the Euro Notes (2026).
Interest on the Euro Notes (2028) is payable in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Euro Notes (2028) are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by LKQ Corporation and the Euro Notes (2028) Subsidiaries (the "Euro Notes (2028) Guarantors"). 
The Euro Notes (2028) and the related guarantees are, respectively, LKQ Euro Holdings' and each Euro Notes (2028) Guarantor's senior unsecured obligations and will be subordinated to all of LKQ Euro Holdings' and the Euro Notes (2028) Guarantors' existing and future secured debt to the extent of the assets securing that secured debt.

The Euro Notes (2028) have been listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin.
The Euro Notes (2028) are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price of 
100

Note 19. 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
We are exposed to market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Under current policies, we may use derivatives to manage our exposure to variable interest rates on our debt and changing foreign exchange rates for certain foreign currency denominated transactions. We do not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
Derivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges
In February 2023, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on our variable interest rate payments related to borrowings under our Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, we pay the fixed interest rate and receive a variable interest rate based on term SOFR that matches a contractually specified rate under the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement. The agreements include a total $
400
 million notional amount maturing in February 2025 with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
4.63
% and a total $
300
 million notional amount maturing in February 2026 with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
4.23
%. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to Interest expense when the hedged interest payments affect earnings. The activity related to the interest rate swaps is classified in operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the activity relates to normal recurring settlements to match interest payments.
In March 2023, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of changes in interest rates related to forecasted debt issuance to finance a portion of the Uni-Select Acquisition. These swaps were settled in May 2023 upon issuance of the U.S. Notes (2028/33), resulting in total payments of $
13
 million. See Note 18, "Long-Term Obligations" for additional information related to the offering of the U.S. Notes (2028/33). Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and the fair value at the termination date is being reclassified to Interest expense over the term of the debt. Payments made to settle the forward starting interest rate swaps were classified in financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as these payments were related to the forecasted debt issuance.
All of our interest rate swap contracts have been executed with counterparties that we believe are creditworthy, and we closely monitor the credit ratings of these counterparties.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the notional amounts, balance sheet classification and fair values of our derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were as follows (in millions):

The activity related to our cash flow hedges is included in Note 16, "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)." As of December 31, 2024, we estimate that $
2
 million of derivative losses (net of tax) included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into our Consolidated Statements of Income within the next 12 months. 
Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedges
To manage the foreign currency exposure related to the Uni-Select Acquisition purchase price (denominated in CAD), we entered into foreign exchange contracts in March 2023 to purchase CAD 
1.6
 billion for approximately $
1.2
 billion. These contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting, and therefore, the contracts were adjusted to fair value through the results of operations as of each balance sheet date. We reported Gains on foreign exchange contracts - acquisition related on the

Consolidated Statements of Income of $
49
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. These contracts were settled in July 2023 resulting in total payments received of $
49
 million.
To manage our foreign currency exposure on other non-functional currency denominated intercompany loans, we enter into short-term foreign currency forward contracts from time to time. We have not elected to apply hedge accounting for these transactions, and therefore the contracts are adjusted to fair value through our results of operations as of each balance sheet date. The effect on our results of operations for these contracts during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, were not material. The fair values of these short-term derivative instruments that remained outstanding as of year-end were recorded in either Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not material at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Additionally, we hold other short-term derivative instruments, including foreign currency forward contracts, to manage our exposure to variability in the cash flows related to inventory purchases denominated in a non-functional currency. We have not elected to apply hedge accounting for these transactions. The notional amount and fair value of these contracts at December 31, 2024 and 2023, along with the effect on our results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, were not material. The fair values of these contracts were recorded in either Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Gross vs. Net Presentation for Derivative Instruments
While certain derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are subject to master netting arrangements, we present our cash flow hedge and other derivative instruments on a gross basis on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The impact of netting the fair values of these contracts would result in an immaterial decrease to Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Note 20. 
Fair Value Measurements
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
We use the market and income approaches to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and during the year ended December 31, 2024, there were no significant changes in valuation techniques or inputs related to the financial assets or liabilities that we have historically recorded at fair value. The tiers in the fair value hierarchy include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as significant unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
The following table presents information about our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs we utilized to determine such fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):

LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Investments in debt and equity securities relate to our captive insurance subsidiary and are included in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The balance sheet classification of the interest rate swap agreements is presented in Note 19, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." For contingent consideration liabilities, the current portion is included in Other current liabilities and the noncurrent portion is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the expected timing of the related payments.
We value derivative instruments using a third party valuation model that performs discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contracts and market observable inputs such as current and forward interest rates and current and forward foreign exchange rates.
Our contingent consideration liabilities are related to our business acquisitions. Under the terms of the contingent consideration agreements, payments may be made at specified future dates depending on the performance of the acquired business subsequent to the acquisition. The liabilities for these payments are classified as Level 3 liabilities because the related fair value measurement, which is determined using an income approach, includes significant inputs not observable in the market.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value
Our debt is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at cost. The fair value measurements of the borrowings under the credit agreement are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy since they are determined based upon significant inputs observable in the market, including interest rates on recent financing transactions with similar terms and maturities. We estimated the fair value by calculating the upfront cash payment a market participant would require at December 31, 2024 and 2023 to assume these obligations. The fair values of the U.S. Notes (2028), U.S. Notes (2033), Euro Notes (2024), Euro Notes (2028) and Euro Notes (2031) are determined based upon observable market inputs including quoted market prices in markets that are not active, and therefore are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 
Based on market conditions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the borrowings under the Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement reasonably approximated the carrying values of $
1,164
 million and $
1,414
 million, respectively. As of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the borrowings under the CAD Note reasonably approximated the carrying values of $
487
 million and $
529
 million, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As of December 31, 2024, operating lease payments for leases that have not yet commence
d totaled $
41
 million, which primarily includes the synthetic lease arrangements discussed below
. These operating leases will commence in the n
ext 
21
 months 
with lease te
rms of 
3

to 
15
 years
. Most of these leases have not commenced because the assets are in the process of being constructed.
Synthetic Lease Arrangements
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into two synthetic leases to finance the construction of salvage yard facilities, with an aggregate estimated cost of approximately $
100
 million. These leases have an aggregate future lease commitment of approximately $
35
 million as of December 31, 2024. The leases will commence upon completion of construction of the facilities which are expected to be in the later part of 2026. Each lease term is 
five years
 after commencement. At the end of the leases' terms, we will be required to purchase the facilities or, in the event that option is not elected, to request to extend the leases, or vacate the property and relocate. Upon each lease commencement, the lease classification, right-of-use asset, and lease liability will be determined and recorded. Each lease arrangement contains a residual value guarantee of 
100
% of the total construction cost. The synthetic leases contain covenants that are consistent with our Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement. See Note 18, "Long-Term Obligations" for further information on our Senior Unsecured Credit Agreement.

(1)
    We use the fair value of our plan assets to calculate the expected return on plan assets.
(2)
    Actuarial gains and losses are amortized using a corridor approach for our pension plans. Gains and losses are amortized if, as of the beginning of the year, the cumulative net gain or loss exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining service period of active members expected to receive benefits under the plan or, in the case of closed plans, the expected future lifetime of the employees participating in the plan.
The service cost component of net periodic benefit cost was classified in SG&A expenses, while the other components of net periodic benefit cost were classified in Interest income and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
The table below summarizes the weighted-average assumptions used to calculate the net periodic benefit cost in the table above:

    Our expected long-term return on plan assets is determined based on the asset allocation and estimate of future long-term returns by asset class.
Assumed mortality is also a key assumption in determining benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost. In some of the European and Canadian plans, a price inflation index is also an assumption in determining benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As of December 31, 2024, the pretax amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of $
2
 million of net actuarial gains for our defined benefit plans that have not yet been recognized in net periodic benefit cost. Of this amount, we expect an insignificant amount

to be recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost during the year ending December 31, 2025.
Fair Value of Plan Assets
Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The tiers in the fair value hierarchy include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as significant unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. Investments that are valued using net asset value (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy disclosure.
For the unfunded pension plans, we pay the defined benefit plan obligations when they become due. 
The table below summarizes the fair value of our defined benefit plan assets by asset category within the fair value hierarchy for the funded defined benefit pension plans (in millions):

Assets for the defined benefit pension plans in Europe are invested primarily in insurance policies. For the defined benefit pension plans in Canada, a portion of the assets representing a subset of inactive plan participants are invested in insurance policies. Under these contracts, we pay premiums to the insurance company, which are based on an internal actuarial analysis performed by the insurance company; the insurance company then funds the pension payments to the plan participants upon retirement.

Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $
2,075
 million at December 31, 2024. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally provided a 
100
% participation exemption from further U.S. taxation of dividends received from 10-percent or more owned foreign corporations held by U.S. corporate shareholders. Although foreign dividend income is generally exempt from U.S. federal tax in the hands of the U.S. corporate shareholders, either as a result of the participation exemption, or due to the previous taxation of such earnings under the transition tax and GILTI regimes, companies must still apply the guidance of ASC 740: Income Taxes to account for the tax consequences of outside basis differences and other tax impacts of their investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Further, the 2017 transition tax reduced a majority of the previous outside basis differences in our foreign subsidiaries, and most of any new differences arising have extensive interaction with the GILTI regime.
Based on a review of our global financing and capital expenditure requirements as of December 31, 2024, we continue to plan to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries. Thus, no deferred U.S. income taxes or potential foreign withholding taxes have been recorded. Due to the complexity of the U.S. tax regime, it remains impractical to estimate the amount of deferred taxes potentially payable were such earnings to be repatriated. 
The OECD released a framework, referred to as Pillar Two, to implement a global minimum corporate tax rate of 
15
% on certain multinational enterprises. Certain countries have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework while several countries are considering or still announcing changes to their tax laws to implement the minimum tax directive. We have evaluated the developments and do not anticipate any material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

We have net operating loss carryforwards, primarily for certain international tax jurisdictions, the tax benefits of which totaled approximately $
38
 million and $
53
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $
15
 million decrease in net operating loss carryforwards is primarily related to the sale of certain European entities. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had tax credit carryforwards for U.S. and certain U.S. state jurisdictions, the tax benefits of which totaled approximately $
3
 million and less than $
1
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had interest deduction carryforwards in Italy the tax benefits of which totaled $
30
 million and $
32
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had capital loss carryforwards, the tax benefit of which totaled an insignificant amount at both periods. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, valuation allowances of $
51
 million and $
64
 million, respectively, were recorded for deferred tax assets related to the foreign interest deduction carryforwards, certain foreign and U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards. The $
13
 million net decrease in valuation allowances was primarily attributable to the change in the net operating loss carryforward previously noted.
91
LKQ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The majority of the net operating losses will generally carry forward until 2034 to 2043. The interest deduction carryforwards in Italy do not expire. U.S. capital losses can be carried back three years and forward for five years. Realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration dates, where applicable, or in the case of interest deduction carryforward, subject to legislative thin capitalization constraints, typically based on profitability. Based on historical and projected operating results, we believe that it is more likely than not that earnings will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets for which valuation allowances have not been provided. While we expect to realize the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, changes in tax laws or in estimates of future taxable income may alter this expectation.

During the twelve months beginning January 1, 2025, it is reasonably possible that we will reduce unrecognized tax benefits by $
17
 million, none of which would impact our effective tax rate.
Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits above as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, are approximately $
10
 million, $
8
 million and $
5
 million, respectively that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2024 includes $
18
 million, and at both December 31, 2023 and 2022, an insignificant amount of tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in adjustments to deferred taxes.
We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had accumulated interest and penalties of $
1
 million, attributable to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded $
1
 million or less of interest and penalties through the income tax provision, prior to any reversals for lapses in the statutes of limitations and settlements. 
The Company and/or its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various U.S. state and international jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or international income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2018. Adjustments from examinations, if any, are not expected to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Amounts presented include depreciation and amortization expense recorded within Cost of goods sold, SG&A expenses and Restructuring and transaction related expenses.
The key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our CODM, our Chief Executive Officer, is Segment EBITDA. The CODM uses Segment EBITDA to compare profitability among the segments and evaluate business strategies. Segment EBITDA includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. Corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue. We calculate Segment EBITDA as Net Income excluding net income and loss attributable to noncontrolling interest; income and loss from discontinued operations; depreciation; amortization; interest; gains and losses on debt extinguishment; income tax expense; restructuring and transaction related expenses; change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; other gains and losses related to acquisitions, equity method investments, or divestitures; equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries; equity investment fair value adjustments; impairment charges; and direct impacts of the Ukraine/Russia conflict.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of LKQ Corporation's management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that LKQ Corporation and subsidiaries' (the "Company") disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting dated 
February 20, 2025 
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.
Internal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices, and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
96
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board.
Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company included in this report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
