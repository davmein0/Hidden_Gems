OVERVIEW

Founded in 1927, Littelfuse is a diversified, industrial technology manufacturing company empowering a sustainable, connected, and safer world. Across more than 20 countries, and with approximately 16,000 global associates, we partner with customers to design and deliver innovative, reliable solutions. Serving over 100,000 end customers, our products are found in a variety of industrial, transportation and electronics end markets – everywhere, every day.
Segments

The Company conducts its business through three reportable segments: Electronics,
 Transportation, 
and Industrial. Within these segments, the Company designs, manufactures and sells electronic components, modules and subassemblies to empower the long-term secular growth themes of sustainability, connectivity and safety. The Company has positioned itself within the center of these global structural growth themes by helping to enable its customers’ applications focused on a more sustainable, connected, and safer world. The ever-increasing complexity of applications surrounding these themes continues to drive greater demand for the Company’s innovative, reliable products and a higher level of product content within a broad range of applications. With its expanding, diversified, product portfolio, the Company has evolved its presence across the industrial, transportation and electronics end markets it serves. The Company's exposure with each of these end markets is relatively balanced. With a deep list of target applications within each primary end market, the Company believes its balanced approach positions its business for long-term sustainability, increases diversification and creates additional growth opportunities. Across electronics end markets, product demand is largely driven by electrification, energy and power efficiency, automation, connectivity, artificial intelligence, and safety. In transportation end markets, including passenger and commercial vehicles, the ongoing electronification and electrification of applications is driving increased product demand. Across industrial end markets, product demand is driven by an ecosystem that continues to advance sustainability, safety and automation capabilities. For example, renewables, including solar and wind energy, and energy storage systems that enable lower carbon emissions, the ongoing proliferation of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, more efficient climate control units, increasing requirements for electrical safety, the rising demand for factory and process automation, and motor drives and power supplies.

MANUFACTURING
The Company’s manufacturing facilities are in China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Mexico, Philippines, the U.K., the U.S., and Vietnam. The Company performs the majority of its own fabrication and maintains in-house capabilities for metal stamping, surface mount assembly, plating (silver, nickel, zinc, and oxides) thermoplastic molding, and high-precision manufacturing, miniaturization and haptics. In addition, the Company fabricates semiconductor wafers for certain applications and maintains in-house capability for epitaxy fabrication, die attach, and wafer probe testing. After sub-components are readied for assembly, final assembly is accomplished on fully automatic and semi-automatic assembly machines. Quality assurance and operations personnel, using techniques such as statistical process control, perform tests, checks and measurements during the production process to maintain the highest levels of product quality, including safety and reliability, and customer satisfaction. Additionally, the Company utilizes external wafer foundries and subcontracted test and assembly facilities for a portion of its semiconductor business.
The principal raw materials for the Company’s products include copper and copper alloys, resin and heat-resistant plastics, zinc, melamine, glass, silver, gold, raw silicon, solder, rubber, and various gases. The Company’s strategy is to prequalify suppliers for quality assurance and supply continuity, as much as possible, to localize supply sources close to its manufacturing sites. This helps to minimize the transportation of materials, and ultimately reduces the Company’s environmental footprint by decreasing emissions, consistent with its sustainability strategy. For critical materials, the Company looks to diversify its supplier base by prequalifying second sources.
SALES AND MARKETING

CYBERSECURITY
The cybersecurity and data protection program at Littelfuse is based on foundational principles outlined in applicable industry and internationally accepted-cybersecurity frameworks.

The Company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber-attacks, attempts to breach its systems, and other similar incidents, however we do not believe that the prior cyber incidents have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company. Littelfuse faces risks from cybersecurity threats that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or reputation. Like all cybersecurity programs, there is no guarantee that every attack method and technique has been fully addressed, as these change constantly, but Littelfuse is diligent in its attempts to protect data of the Company and its stakeholders.
Littelfuse strives to assess and update its cybersecurity program on a regular basis using an Information Security Management System ("ISMS") comprised of three main elements – 1) independent internationally recognized vendors and technologies for assessments and monitoring, 2) strong internal controls based on industry standards, and 3) Board and Senior Leadership governance and support.
