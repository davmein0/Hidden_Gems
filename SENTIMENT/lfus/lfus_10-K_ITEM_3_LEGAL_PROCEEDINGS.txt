2024 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Net sales were $2,190.8 million, which decreased by $171.9 million, or 7.3%, in 2024 compared to 2023 including $7.9 million of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower volume of $163.7 million in the Electronics segment primarily driven by reduced demand and inventory rebalancing in the semiconductor business. The Company recognized net income of $100.2 million, or $4.00 per diluted share, in 2024 compared to net income of $259.5 million, or $10.34 per diluted share in 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating income of $130.7 million in the Electronics segment due to lower sales in the semiconductor business and $92.6 million of non-cash impairment charges. The non-cash impairment charges included $47.8 million for the impairment of intangible assets primarily related to certain acquired customer relationships, developed technology, and tradename in the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit within the Industrial segment, and $36.1 million and $8.6 million of non-cash goodwill impairment charges associated with the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit within the Industrial segment and the Automotive sensors reporting unit within the Transportation segment, respectively.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $367.6 million for the fiscal year 2024, a decrease of $89.8 million, compared to $457.4 million during the fiscal year 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower cash earnings.
Based on the Company’s assessment, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that, as of December 28, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the identification of the material weaknesses described below. In making this assessment, management has concluded that we did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. Specifically, at certain of our non-U.S. manufacturing locations we lacked sufficiently skilled operational and accounting personnel to ensure that internal control responsibilities were performed and aligned with internal control objectives.
The material weakness in the control environment contributed to an additional material weakness related to the design and operating effectiveness of control activities over the existence of inventory at these locations. The Company did not maintain effective controls related to inventory cycle counts to validate existence of inventory, and consequently, the completeness and accuracy of the data used in evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation of inventory and related reserves. These material weaknesses resulted in corrections through cumulative out-of-period adjustments as described in notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 28, 2024. The material weaknesses resulted in immaterial corrections to previously released financial results. For a description of the material weaknesses identified by management and the remediation efforts being implemented for the material weaknesses, see “Part II, Item 9A - Controls and Procedures.” for further discussion.
On December 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of a 200mm wafer fab located in Dortmund, Germany ("Dortmund Fab") from Elmos Semiconductor SE. The total purchase price for the Dortmund Fab was approximately 94 million Euro, of which a 37.2 million Euro down payment (approximately $40.5 million) was made in the third quarter of 2023 and recorded in

Prepaid expenses and other current assets
 in the Consolidated Balance Sheets after regulatory approvals. The payment of 56.7 million Euro was paid at closing in the beginning of the fiscal year 2025. The transaction did not have any impact on the Company's 2024 financial results and reported in the Electronics-Semiconductor business within the Company’s Electronics segment.
On October 4, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a group annuity contract, under which an insurance company will be required to pay pension payments to the Company’s United Kingdom pension plan to match required pension payments until a later buyout, at which point the insurance company will directly pay and administer the 
26
Table of Contents

benefits to the plan's participants, or to their designated beneficiaries. The purchase of this group annuity contract will reduce the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligation by approximately $23 million, representing approximately 33% of the total obligations of the Company’s qualified pension plans, and was funded with pension plan assets and additional cash on hand. In connection with this transaction, the Company currently expects to record a one-time non-cash settlement charge in 2026 estimated between $6 million and $8 million, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. The actual settlement charge could differ from this estimate due to final data and plan wind-up expenses.
Other Risk
The Company has been notified by one of its customers of a product recall potentially due to certain fuses provided by Littelfuse and incorporated in such products. The Company is currently working with its customer to investigate the cause and level of responsibility for this recall. The Company has determined pursuant to ASC 450, "Contingencies
" 
that a loss is reasonably possible. However, the Company continues to evaluate this matter and the ultimate costs of the recall and range of the potential loss cannot be determined at this time. Accordingly, no accrual has been made yet for this matter. Factors that will impact the amount of such losses include the per vehicle cost of fuse replacement, the determination of the relative liability among the customer, the Company, and any relevant third parties, as well as actual insurance recoveries
.
Further, the global trade policies and tensions could create additional complexities. Our international presence subjects us to risks associated with international trade conflicts between the United States and its trade partners, including, without limitation, China, Mexico and Canada, particularly with regard to tariffs and import/export controls. These factors in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we do not or are unable to increase prices, could result in lower margins on products sold. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted in, and could result in more, U.S. trading partners adopting responsive trade policies making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. Additionally, continued geo-political issues may result in customers outside the U.S. seeking to source products from local suppliers, which could result in lower sales or lost customers.

Critical Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company’s most critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company has identified the following as its most critical accounting policies and judgments. Although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available when they are made, and therefore, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. Significant accounting policies are more fully described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Goodwill

The Company’s methodology for allocating the purchase price of acquisitions is based on established valuation techniques that reflect the consideration of a number of factors, including valuations performed by third-party appraisers when appropriate. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Based on its current organization structure, the Company has seven reporting units for which cash flows are determinable and to which goodwill has been allocated. 

The Company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company also performs an interim review for indicators of impairment each quarter to assess whether an interim impairment review is required for any reporting unit. As part of its interim reviews, management analyzes potential changes in the value of individual reporting units based on each reporting unit’s operating results for the period compared to expected results as of the prior year’s annual impairment test. In addition, management considers how other key assumptions, including discount rates and expected long-term growth rates, used in the last annual impairment test, could be impacted by changes in market conditions and economic events. 

As a result of the 2024 annual goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded non-cash charges of $36.1 million and $8.6 million to reflect the impairment of goodwill for the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit within the Industrial segment and the Automotive sensors reporting unit within the Transportation segment, respectively. There were no impairment charges recorded during the fiscal years of 2023 and 2022.
The goodwill impairment charge for the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit was due to a reduction in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit based on lower expectations for future revenue, profitability and cash flows as compared to the expectations of the 2023 annual goodwill impairment test. These lower expectations were driven by lower-than-expected demand in the electric vehicle end market as well as reduced government funding to support charging infrastructures for electric vehicles, primarily in Europe. 
The goodwill impairment charge for the Automotive sensors reporting unit was due to reductions in the estimated fair value for the Automotive sensors reporting unit based on lower expectations for future revenue, profitability and cash flows as compared to the expectations of the 2023 annual goodwill impairment test. These lower future expectations were driven by projected  declines in end market demand and reduced revenue and profitability with existing customers.
Quantitative Assessment for Impairment

For the seven reporting units with goodwill, the Company compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value is recorded as the amount of the goodwill impairment charge. The results of the goodwill impairment test as of September 29, 2024 indicated that the estimated fair values for the Industrial controls and sensors and Automotive sensors reporting units were below their respective carrying values. Accordingly, the Company recorded non-cash charges of $36.1 million and $8.6 million, respectively, to reflect the impairment of goodwill for the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit within the Industrial segment and the Automotive sensors reporting unit within the Transportation segment. As a result of the impairment charge, the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit had $115.2 million of goodwill 
as of December 28, 2024. There was no goodwill remaining within the Automotive sensors reporting unit as of December 28, 2024. For the remainder of the Company's reporting units: Electronics-Passive Products and Sensors, Electronics-Semiconductor, Passenger Car Products, Commercial Vehicle Products, and Industrial Circuit Protection, the results of the goodwill impairment test as of September 29, 2024 indicated that their estimated fair values exceeded their respective carrying values.

As part of its impairment test for these reporting units, the Company engaged a third-party appraisal firm to assist in the Company’s determination of the estimated fair values. This determination included estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, discount rates and the allocation of shared or corporate items. The market approach estimates fair values using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. The Company weighted both the income and market approach equally to estimate the concluded fair value of each reporting unit. The determination of fair value requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions, which primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures.

Goodwill Impairment Assumptions

Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company’s equity may also result in a conclusion that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.

One measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit “passed” (fair value exceeds the carrying value) the goodwill impairment test. With the exception of the Industrial controls and sensors and the Automotive sensors reporting units, the other five reporting units passed the goodwill impairment test, with estimated fair values that exceeded the carrying values between 44% and 409%. As of the most recent annual test conducted on September 29, 2024, the Company noted that the excess of fair value over the carrying value was 108%, 82%, 96%, 44%, and 409% for its reporting units: Electronics-Passive Products and Sensors, Electronics-Semiconductor, Passenger Car Products, Commercial Vehicle Products, and Industrial Circuit Protection, respectively. Relatively small changes in the Company’s key assumptions would not have resulted in any reporting units failing the goodwill impairment test.

Generally, changes in estimates of expected future cash flows would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. That is, a 1.0% decrease in estimated annual future cash flows would decrease the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 1.0%. The estimated long-term net sales growth rate can have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows, and therefore, the fair value of each reporting unit. A 1.0% decrease in the long-term net sales growth rate would have resulted in no reporting units failing the goodwill impairment test. Of the other key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values, most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate. The estimated discount rate was 10.6% for the Electronics-Passive Products and Sensors, Electronics-Semiconductor, and Industrial Circuit Protection reporting units, 11.5% for the Passenger Car Products and Commercial Vehicle Products reporting units, 12.3% for the Automotive Sensors reporting unit, and 14.9% for the Industrial Controls and Sensors reporting unit. A 1.0% increase in the estimated discount rates would have resulted in no reporting units failing the annual goodwill impairment test. The Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows and discount rates are reasonable, but future changes in the underlying assumptions could differ due to the inherent uncertainty in making such estimates. Additionally, price deterioration or lower volume could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting units.
Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates the recoverability of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business, and a significant decrease in the market value of the assets or significant negative industry or economic trends. When the Company determines that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future 
undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. For the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $47.8 million for the impairment of intangible assets, including $47.6 million related to the impairment of certain acquired customer relationships, developed technology, and tradename intangible assets in the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit within the Industrial segment. The impairment of the intangible assets resulted from lower expectations of future revenue and cash flows driven by lower-than-expected demand in the electrical vehicle end market as well as reduced government funding to support charging infrastructures for electric vehicles, primarily in Europe. The remaining impairment charges included $0.2 million for patents and customer relationships related to the exit of a small business in China within the Industrial segment. In addition, during the first quarter of 2024, the Company recognized a $0.9 million impairment related to certain machinery and equipment in the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment. For the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, the Company recognized a $3.9 million impairment charge related to the land and building of a property in the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment that the Company made the decision to donate, a $0.9 million impairment charge substantially related to certain patents in a business within the Industrial segment, and a $0.1 million impairment on certain machinery and equipment in the semiconductor business within the Electronics segment.
Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes are recognized for the future effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes deferred taxes for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit and other tax attribute carryforwards (excluding carryforwards where usage has been determined to be remote). Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. U.S. state and non-U.S. income taxes are provided on the portion of non-U.S. income that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable (and non-U.S. income taxes are provided on the portion of non-U.S. income that is expected to be remitted to an upper-tier non-U.S. entity). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
Deferred income taxes are not provided on the excess of the investment value for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in those non-U.S. subsidiaries for which such excess is considered to be permanently reinvested in those operations. Management regularly evaluates whether non-U.S. earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. This evaluation requires judgment about the future operating and liquidity needs of the Company and its non-U.S. subsidiaries. Changes in economic and business conditions, non-U.S. or U.S. tax laws, or the Company’s financial situation could result in changes to these judgments and the need to record additional tax liabilities.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), among other things, imposed a one-time tax (the “Toll Charge”) on accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and included base broadening provisions commonly referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income provisions ("GILTI"). 
In accordance with guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") staff, the Company has adopted an accounting policy to treat any GILTI inclusions as a period cost if and when incurred. Thus, for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, deferred taxes were computed without consideration of the possible future impact of the GILTI provisions, and any current year impact was recorded as a part of the current portion of income tax expense.
Further information regarding income taxes, including a detailed reconciliation of current year activity, is provided in Note 14,

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the Company satisfies its performance obligation and control of the product is transferred to the customer. The Company’s sales arrangements with customers are predominately short term in nature and generally provide for transfer of control at the time of shipment as this is the point at which title and risk of loss of the product transfers to the customer. At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the Company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer. The amount of revenue recorded reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods and may include adjustments for customer allowance, rebates and price adjustments. The Company’s sales channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third-party distributors.

The Company has elected the practical expedient under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 340-40-25-4 to expense commissions when incurred as the amortization period of the commission asset the Company would have otherwise recognized is less than one year.

Revenue and Billing

The Company generally accepts orders from customers through receipt of purchase orders or electronic data interchange based on written sales agreements and purchasing contracts. Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs, and competition. Pricing is often negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the Company’s published price lists. The customer is invoiced when the Company’s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement. As the Company’s standard payment terms are less than one year, the Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. The Company also elected the practical expedient provided in ASC 606-10-25-18B to treat all product shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities, and therefore recognize the gross revenue associated with the contract, inclusive of any shipping and handling revenue. 
Ship and Debit Program

Some of the terms of the Company’s sales agreements and normal business conditions provide customers (distributors) the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced. This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a “ship and debit” program. This program allows the distributors to debit the Company for the difference between the distributors’ contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions. Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization for pricing allowances to reduce its price. When the Company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to “debit” its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price. The Company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity, distributor inventory levels and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
Return to Stock

The Company has a return to stock policy whereby certain customers, with prior authorization from the Company's management, can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit. The Company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity. Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.

Volume Rebates

The Company offers volume-based sales incentives to certain customers to encourage greater product sales. If customers achieve their specific quarterly or annual sales targets, they are entitled to rebates. The Company estimates the projected amount of rebates that will be achieved by the customer and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
Allowance for Credit Losses 
The Company currently measures the expected credit losses based on our historical credit loss experience. The Company has not experienced significant recent or historical credit losses and is not forecasting any significant credit losses which would require adjustments to our methodology. If current conditions and supportable forecasts indicate that our historical loss experience is not reasonable and no longer supportable, the Company may adjust its historical credit loss experience to reflect these conditions and forecasts. The Company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the Company becomes aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also analyzes all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and historical collection and loss experience. Historically, the allowance for credit losses has been adequate to cover bad debts. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
Inventory

The Company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory, which include a review of, among other factors, demand requirements, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, shelf life, and quality issues. Based on the analysis, the Company records adjustments to inventory for excess quantities, obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value. Historically, inventory reserves have been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable value.
Environmental Liabilities

Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of the probability of potential future environmental exposure. Costs related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred. If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the Company’s recorded liability for such claims, it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. The Company evaluates its reserve for coal mine remediation annually utilizing a third-party expert.

Pension Plans

The Company records annual income and expense amounts relating to its pension and postretirement benefits plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return, and compensation increases. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis as of the fiscal year-end balance sheet date (or more frequently if a significant event requiring remeasurement occurs) and modifies the assumption based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effects of modifications are recognized immediately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets but are generally amortized into operating earnings over future periods, with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and input from its actuaries and investment advisors. The Company maintains several pension plans in international locations. The expected returns on plan assets and discount rates are determined based on each plan’s investment approach, local interest rates and plan participant profiles. The weighted-average

discount rates for the Company’s defined benefit plans primarily in Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were both 5.6%.
On October 4, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a group annuity contract, under which an insurance company will be required to pay pension payments to the Company’s United Kingdom pension plan to match required pension payments until a later buyout, at which point the insurance company will directly pay and administer the benefits to the plan's participants, or to their designated beneficiaries. The purchase of this group annuity contract will reduce the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligation by approximately $23 million, representing approximately 33% of the total obligations of the Company’s qualified pension plans, and will be funded with pension plan assets and additional cash on hand. In connection with this transaction, the Company currently expects to record a one-time non-cash settlement charge in 2026 estimated between $6 million and $8 million, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. The actual settlement charge could differ from this estimate due to final data and plan wind-up expenses.
Equity-Based Compensation

Equity-based compensation expense is recorded for stock-option awards and restricted share units based upon the fair values of the awards. The fair value of stock-option awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes assumptions for volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Littelfuse stock, historical volatility of Littelfuse stock, and other factors. Historical data is used to estimate employee termination experience and the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company initiated a quarterly cash dividend in 2010 and expects to continue making cash dividend payments for the foreseeable future. The fair value of restricted share units is determined based on the Company's stock price on the grant date reduced by the present value of expected dividends through the vesting period.

Total equity-based compensation expense for all equity compensation plans was $27.4 million, $25.7 million, and $24.6 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Further information regarding this expense is provided in Note 12, 
Stock-Based Compensation

Net Sales
Net sales were $2,190.8 million, which decreased by $171.9 million, or 7.3% compared to 2023, including $7.9 million of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates for 2024 compared to 2023. The net sales decrease was primarily due to lower volume of $163.7 million in the Electronics segment, primarily driven by reduced demand and inventory rebalancing in the semiconductor business.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales was $1,403.2 million, or 64.1% of net sales, in 2024 compared to $1,462.4 million, or 61.9% of net sales, in 2023.
 As a percent of net sales, cost of sales increased 2.2% driven by 
lower volume in the Electronics segment, partially offset by improved margin from all businesses within the Transportation segment driven by favorable price, product mix and cost reduction initiatives. In addition, during the year ended December 28, 2024, the Company identified certain errors in its previously issued financial statements that have now been corrected through cumulative out-of-period adjustments in the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 28, 2024. The error that was identified by management related to the valuation and existence of inventory that originated in prior periods at certain of our non-U.S. manufacturing locations within the Transportation and Industrial segments. As a result, the Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment of  $13.5 million in the year ended December 28, 2024, of which $12.3 million was the cumulative out-of-period adjustment related to fiscal years prior to 2024. The out-of-period adjustment negatively impacted cost of sales as percentage of net sales by 0.6%.

Gross Profit

Gross profit was $787.5 million, or 35.9% of net sales, in 2024, compared to $900.2 million, or 38.1% of net sales, in 2023. The $112.7 million decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower volume in the Electronics and Industrial segments, partially offset by improved margin from all businesses within the Transportation segment driven by favorable price, product mix and cost reduction initiatives. As mentioned above, the out-of-period adjustments of $13.5 million negatively impacted gross margin by 0.6%.
Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses were $628.8 million, or 28.7% of net sales, for 2024 compared to $539.4 million, or 22.8% of net sales, for 2023. The increase in operating expenses of $89.4 million was primarily due to an increase in restructuring, impairment, and other charges of $91.9 million, which included a non-cash impairment charge of $47.8 million for the impairment of intangible assets primarily related to certain acquired customer relationships, developed technology, and tradename in the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit within the Industrial segment, and $36.1 million and $8.6 million of non-cash goodwill impairment charges associated with the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit within the Industrial segment and the Automotive sensors reporting unit within the Transportation segment, respectively. Additionally, the Company incurred higher research and development expenses of $5.3 million. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses of $4.2 million as a result of lower legal and professional fees and other integration expenses related to completed and contemplated acquisitions and lower amortization expense of $3.7 million.

Operating Income

Operating income for 2024 was $158.8 million
, a decrease of $202.1 million or 56.0% compared to $360.9 million for 2023. 
 The decrease in operating income was due to lower operating income of $130.7 million from the Electronics segment and higher operating expenses due to the non-cash charge of $92.6 million from the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill as noted above, partially offset by higher operating income of $24.9 million from the Transportation segment. 
Operating margins decreased from 15.3% in 2023 to 7.2% in 2024 primarily driven by low
er volume in the Electronics segment
 and the higher operating expenses mentioned ab
ove. The total non-cash charges of $92.6 million from the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill negatively impacted the 2024 operating margin by 4.2%.
Income Before Income Taxes

Income before income taxes for 2024 was $151.9 million, or 6.9% of net sales compared to $328.6 million, or 13.9% of net sales for 2023. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before income taxes was primarily benefited by foreign exchange gains of $9.2 million in the fiscal year 2024 compared to foreign exchange losses of $12.3 million in the fiscal year 2023, and higher interest income of $9.0 million from short-term investments in cash equivalents, partially offset by higher coal mine charges of $1.8 million and non-operating pension expense. 
Income Taxes

Income tax expense for 2024 was $51.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 34.0%, compared to income tax expense of $69.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 21.0% for 2023. The effective tax rate for 2024 is higher than the effective tax rate for 2023, 
primarily due to t
he impact of goodwill impairments and non-US losses with no related tax benefit. The effective tax rate for 2024 is higher
 than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of goodwill impairments and non-US losses with no related tax benefit as previously noted. Further information regarding these items is provided in Note 14,

The remaining impairment charges included $0.2 million for patents and customer relationships related to the exit of a small business in China within the Industrial segment. In addition, during the first quarter of 2024, the Company recognized a $0.9 million impairment charge related to certain machinery and equipment in the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment. The Company also recognized total restructuring charges of $14.9 million, primarily for employee termination costs related to the reorganization of certain manufacturing, selling and administrative functions in the semiconductor business within the Electronics segment and the reorganization of certain selling and administrative functions in the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment. See Note 8, 
Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges, 
for further discussion. Also included in "Other" Operating income was $5.1 million of legal and professional fees and other integration expenses related to completed and contemplated acquisitions, a gain of $1.0 million for the sale of two buildings within the Transportation segment, and a gain of $0.5 million recorded for the sale of a land use right within the Electronics segment.
Included in “Other” Operating income for the 2023 was $28.2 million of non-segment charges, of which $11.7 million was for legal and professional fees and other integration expenses related to completed and contemplated acquisitions, $16.5 million of restructuring, impairment and other charges, primarily related to employee termination costs and a $3.9 million impairment charge related to the land and building in the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment. See Note 8, R
estructuring, Impairment and Other Charges
, for further discussion.
Electronics Segment

Net Sales
Net sales for the Electronics segment decreased $163.7 million, or 12.1%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and included unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $4.3 million or 0.3%. The net sales decrease was mainly due to lower volume from the semiconductor business of $152.0 million and to a lesser extent the electronics products business driven by inventory rebalancing at certain distributors and reduced demand across certain electronics markets, including consumer facing and personal electronics, as well as industrial markets.
Operating Income
Operating income was $169.9 million, representing a decrease of $130.7 million, or 43.5%, in 2024 compared to $300.6 million in 2023. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower volume leverage and unfavorable product mix that were partially offset by cost control initiatives. Operating margins decreased from 22.3% in 2023 to 14.3% in 2024 primarily due to the lower volume from the semiconductor business.

Transportation Segment

Net Sales
Net sales in the Transportation segment decreased $5.9 million, or 0.9%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and included unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $2.4 million or 0.4%. The sales decrease was mainly driven by lower volume of $15.0 million and $3.2 million from the automotive sensors and the commercial vehicles businesses, respectively, due to the strategic exit of certain lower margin products and reduced demand largely due to inventory rebalancing at certain distributors and customers, partially offset by a sales increase of $12.3 million from the passenger car business driven by the ongoing electronification and electrification of vehicles and vehicle content growth.
Operating Income
Operating income was $58.6 million, representing an increase of $24.9 million, or 73.9%, in 2024 compared to $33.7 million in 2023. The increase in operating income was primarily due to favorable price and cost reduction initiatives from the commercial vehicle business. Operating margins increased from 5.0% to 8.7% primarily driven by favorable price and product mix and cost reduction initiatives from the commercial vehicle business. In addition, as mentioned above, during the year ended December 28, 2024, the Company identified certain errors in its previously issued financial statements that have now been corrected through cumulative out-of-period adjustments in the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 28, 2024. The out-of-period adjustment related to the Transportation segment was $11.1 million, which negatively impacted operating margin by 1.7%.
Industrial Segment

Net Sales
The Industrial segment net sales decreased by $2.4 million, or 0.7%, in 2024 compared to 2023 and included unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates of $1.2 million or 0.4%. The sales decrease was due to lower volume across industrial control products driven by softer end market demand in the first half of 2024.
Operating Income
Operating income was $42.3 million, representing a decrease of $12.5 million, or 22.8%, in 2024 compared to $54.8 million in 2023. The decrease in operating income was driven by lower volume due to reduced industrial end market demand across industrial control products and industrial circuit protection along with cost inflation. Operating margins were 12.8% in 2024 compared to 16.4% in 2023. The decrease in operating margin was due to cost inflation, partially offset by favorable price. In addition, as mentioned above, during the year ended December 28, 2024, the Company identified certain errors in its previously issued financial statements that have now been corrected through cumulative out-of-period adjustments in the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 28, 2024. The out-of-period adjustment related to the Industrial segment was $4.1 million, which negatively impacted operating margin by 1.2%.

Table of Contents

Net sales were $2,362.7 million, which decreased by $151.2 million, or 6.0% compared to 2022, including $0.7 million of favorable changes in foreign exchange rates for 2023 compared to 2022. The sales decrease was primarily due to lower volume in the Electronics segment and the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment that more than offset $105.1 million or 4.2% of incremental net sales from the C&K Switches and Western Automation acquisitions and higher volume from the Industrial segment. 
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales was $1,462.4 million, or 61.9% of net sales, in 2023, compared to $1,507.0 million, or 59.9% of net sales, in 2022.
 As a percent of net sales, cost of sales increased 2.0% driven by lower volume in the Electronics segment and the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment, partially offset by volume leverage and favorable product mix from the Industrial segment compared to 
2022, and $15.6 million or 0.6% of purchase accounting inventory charges recorded during 2022.
Gross Profit

Gross profit was $900.2 million, or 38.1% of net sales, in 2023, compared to $1,006.9 million, or 40.1% of net sales, in 2022. The $106.7 million decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower volume in the Electronics segment and the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment, partially offset by the acquisition of C&K Switches within the Electronics segment, and volume leverage and favorable product mix from the Industrial segment and $15.6 million or 0.6% of purchase accounting inventory charges recorded during the first nine months of 2022.
Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses were $539.4 million, or 22.8% of net sales, for 2023 compared to $506.1 million, or 20.1% of net sales, for 2022. The increase in operating expenses of $33.3 million was primarily due to higher selling, general, and administrative expenses of $9.8 million, higher amortization expense of $10.1 million and research and development expenses of $6.8 million mainly due to the C&K Switches and Western Automation acquisitions. Additionally, the Company incurred an increase in restructuring, impairment, and other charges of $6.5 million primarily related to the reorganization of certain manufacturing, selling and administrative functions within the Transportation and Industrial segments and a $3.9 million impairment charge related to the land and building of a property in the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment. This increase in operating expenses was partially offset by lower variable incentive compensation expense.

Operating Income

Operating income for 2023 was $360.9 million
, a decrease of $140.0 million or 27.9% compared to $500.8 million for 2022. 
The decrease in operating income was due to lower gross profit from the Electronics and Transportation segments and higher
operating expenses as noted above
. Operating margins decreased from 19.9% in 2022 to 15.3% in 2023 primarily driven by lower volume in the Electronics and Transportation segments and the higher operating expenses mentioned above.
Income Before Income Taxes

Income before income taxes for 2023 was $328.6 million, or 13.9% of net sales compared to $443.0 million, or 17.6% of net sales, for 2022. In addition to the factors impacting comparative results for operating income discussed above, income before income taxes was primarily benefited by lower foreign exchange losses of $12.1 million and lower unrealized losses of $13.7 million related to one of the Company's equity investments for 2023 compared to 2022.
Income Taxes

Income tax expense for 2023 was $69.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 21.0%, compared to income tax expense of $69.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 15.7% for 2022. The effective tax rate for 2023 is higher than the effective tax rate for 2022, 
primarily due to less income earned in lower tax jurisdictions in 
2023
, as well as one-time tax benefits in 
2022
 resulting from losses on investments in the stock of two of the Company's affiliates. The effective tax rate for
 2022
 was lower than the applicable U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to income earned in lower tax jurisdictions as well as the impact of the one-time deductions previously noted. Further information regarding these items is provided in Note 14, 
Income Taxes
, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and cash equivalents were $724.9 million as of December 28, 2024, an increase of $169.4 million as compared to December 30, 2023.

As of December 28, 2024, $422.8 million of the Company's $724.9 million cash and cash equivalents was held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. Of the $422.8 million, at least $228.7 million can be repatriated with minimal tax consequences, although in certain cases a non-U.S.withholding tax would be payable but subsequently refunded. With respect to the remaining $194.1 million, the Company has recognized deferred tax liabilities on approximately $49.7 million as of December 28, 2024 because the amounts are not considered to be permanently reinvested, and the Company may access additional amounts through loans and other means. Repatriation of some non-U.S. cash balances is restricted by local laws. Management regularly evaluates whether foreign earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. This evaluation requires judgment about the future operating and liquidity needs of the Company and its foreign subsidiaries. Changes in economic and business conditions and tax laws could result in changes to these judgments and the need to record additional tax liabilities.
The Company has historically supported its liquidity needs through cash flows from operations. Management expects that the Company’s (i) current level of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, (ii) current and forecasted cash flows from operations, (iii) availability under existing funding arrangements, and (iv) access to capital in the capital markets will provide sufficient funds to support the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, investments, and debt obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.

Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan
On June 30, 2022, the Company amended and restated its Credit Agreement, dated as of April 3, 2020 (as so amended and restated, the “Credit Agreement”) to effect certain changes, including, among other changes: (i) adding a $300 million unsecured term loan credit facility; (ii) making certain financial and non-financial covenants less restrictive on the Company and its subsidiaries; (iii) replacing LIBOR-based interest rate benchmarks and modifying performance-based interest rate margins; and (iv) extending the maturity date to June 30, 2027 (the “Maturity Date”). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company may, from time to time, increase the size of the revolving credit facility or enter into one or more tranches of term loans in minimum increments of $25 million if there is no event of default and the Company is in compliance with certain financial covenants.
Loans made under the available credit facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement ("the Credit Facility") bear interest at the Company’s option, at either Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), fixed for interest periods of one, two, three or six-month periods, plus 1.00% to 1.75%, plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10% or at the bank’s Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus 0.00% to 0.75%, based upon the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company is also required to pay commitment fees on unused portions of the Credit Facility ranging from 0.10% to 0.175%, based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement includes representations, covenants and events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature.
Under the Credit Agreement, revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until the Maturity Date, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company borrowed $300.0 million under a term loan on June 30, 2022. The principal balance of the term loans must be repaid in quarterly installments on the last day of each calendar quarter in the amount of $1.9 million commencing September 30, 2022, through June 30, 2024, and in the amount of $3.8 million commencing September 30, 2024, through March 31, 2027, with the remaining outstanding principal balance payable in full on the Maturity Date. Accrued interest on the loans is payable in arrears on each interest payment date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified in the Credit Agreement. Subject to certain conditions, (i) the Company may terminate or reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, as defined in the Credit Agreement, in whole or in part, and (ii) the Company may prepay the revolving loans or the term loans at any time, without premium or penalty. During the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, the Company made term loan payments of $7.5 million. The revolving loan and term loan balance under the Credit Facility was $100.0 million and $281.3 million, respectively, as of December 28, 2024.

On May 12, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk exposure, effectively converting the interest rate on the Company's SOFR based floating-rate loans to a fixed-rate. The interest rate swap, with a notional value of $200 million, was designated as a cash flow hedge against the variability of cash flows associated with the Company's SOFR based loans scheduled to mature on June 30, 2027.
As of December 28, 2024, the effective interest rate on unhedged portion of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility was 5.71%, and 4.13% on the hedged portion.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently issued accounting standards and their estimated effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are described in Note 1, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information
, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.

Interest Rate Risk
On June 30, 2022, the Company amended and restated its Credit Agreement, dated as of April 3, 2020 to effect certain changes, including, among other changes: (i) adding a $300 million unsecured term loan credit facility; (ii) making certain financial and non-financial covenants less restrictive on the Company and its subsidiaries; (iii) replacing LIBOR-based interest rate benchmarks and modifying performance-based interest rate margins; and (iv) extending the maturity date to June 30, 2027 (the “Maturity Date”). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company may, from time to time, increase the size of the revolving credit facility or enter into one or more tranches of term loans in minimum increments of $25 million if there is no event of default and the Company is in compliance with certain financial covenants.
The revolving loan and term loan balance under the Credit Facility was $100.0 million and $281.3 million, respectively, as of December 28, 2024. On May 12, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk exposure, effectively converting the interest rate on the Company's SOFR based floating-rate loans to a fixed-rate. The interest rate swap, with a notional value of $200 million, was designated as a cash flow hedge against the variability of cash flows associated with the Company's SOFR based loans scheduled to mature on June 30, 2027. The cash flow hedge reduces the Company exposure to future interest rate fluctuation. After consideration of the hedge above, the remaining borrowings of $181.3 million, which represents approximately 21% of the Company's total debt, is subject to future interest rate fluctuations which could potentially have a negative impact on the Company's cash flows. A 
prospective increase of 100 basis points in the interest rate applicable to the Company’s outstanding borrowings under its credit facility would result in an increase of approximatel
y $1.8 million in annual
 interest expense. This exposure would be partially if not fully offset by higher interest income from the Company's investments. 
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

The majority of the Company’s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries. The Company has operations in China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Mexico, Philippines, U.K., Japan, Lithuania, Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, U.S., and Vietnam. During 2024, sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 63% of total net sales. During 2023, sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 65% of total net sales. Substantially all 
44
Table of Contents

sales in Europe are denominated in euros and substantially all sales in the Asia-Pacific region are denominated in U.S. dollars, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, or Korean won.

The Company’s foreign exchange exposures result primarily from intercompany loans, external borrowings, sale of products in foreign currencies, foreign currency denominated purchases, employee-related, and other costs of running operations in foreign countries. The Company’s most significant foreign currency exposures are to the euro, Chinese renminbi, Mexican peso, and Philippine peso. Changes in foreign exchange rates could affect the Company’s sales, costs, balance sheet values, and earnings. In July 2024, the Company implemented a hedging program to manage foreign currency risk exposure related to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and Mexican peso. These foreign currency zero cost collars are designated as cash flow hedges for a portion of our Mexican peso-denominated manufacturing expenses, predominantly salary expenses, vendor payments, and utility expenses. 

At December 28, 2024, the net value of the Company’s assets with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately $26.3 million, with the largest exposure being a Japanese Yen denominated intercompany loan with a U.S. Dollars functional currency subsidiary. The reduction in earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive asset instruments would be $2.6 million at December 28, 2024. At December 28, 2024, the net value of the Company’s liabilities with exposure to foreign currency risk was $5.5 million, with the largest exposure being U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany loans with a Mexican Peso functional currency subsidiary. The reduction in earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency s
pot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive liability instrumen
ts would be $0.5 million 
at December 28, 2024. As a result of th
e mix in currencies impacting the hypothetical 10% changes, the movements in some instruments would offset movements in other instruments reducing the hypothetical exposure to the Company.

Commodity

Price Risk

The Company uses various metals in the manufacturing of its products, including copper, zinc, tin, gold, and silver. Prices of these and other commodities can rise and result in materially higher costs of producing our products. The Company believes it has adequate primary and secondary sources of supply for each of our key materials. While the Company is exposed to significant changes in certain metal prices and expects higher material costs, the Company actively monitors these exposures, has taken and may take various actions in the future, including price increases and productivity improvements to mitigate any negative impacts of these exposures.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Shareholders

Littelfuse, Inc.
Opinion on the financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Littelfuse, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 28, 2024, the related consolidated statements of net income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for the period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period ended December 28, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of  December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 13, 2025, expressed an adverse opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting because of material weaknesses.
Basis for opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical audit matter 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets– Refer to Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company engages a third-party appraisal firm to assist in the Company’s determination of the estimated fair values for each reporting unit. This determination includes estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, discount rates and the allocation of shared or corporate items. The market approach estimates fair values using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.
The Company evaluates the recoverability of other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. When the Company determines that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the assets are assessed for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. 
47
Table of Contents

We identified the valuation of goodwill and the acquired customer relationships intangible asset within the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit (“reporting unit”) as a critical audit matter because of the reporting unit’s historical performance as compared to projections and because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the respective fair values. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when auditing management’s judgments related to (1) forecasts of revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (“EBITA”), the selection of the peer group companies and associated market multiples, and the selection of the discount rate in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit, and related to (2) the forecast of revenue and the selection of the discount rate in estimating the fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to (1) the Company’s forecasts of revenue and EBITA, the selection of the peer group companies and associated market multiples, and the selection of the discount rate used by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and (2) the forecast of revenue and the selection of the discount rate in estimating the fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset, included the following, among others:
•
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the annual goodwill impairment assessment and the customer relationships intangible asset impairment assessment, including those over (1) the preparation of the revenue and EBITA forecasts, the selection of peer group companies and associated market multiples, and the selection of the discount rate to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and (2) the preparation of the revenue forecast and the selection of the discount rate to estimate the fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset.

•
We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast revenue and EBITA (“forecasts”) by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to:
◦
Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.
◦
Historical results, third-party economic research, industry performance, and peer company performance.
◦
Actual results from the September 29, 2024, annual measurement date to December 28, 2024.
•
We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate changes to both impairment tests if key assumptions are changed.
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, for the customer relationships intangible asset impairment assessment, we assessed the reasonableness of the valuation methodology and the discount rate, by:
◦
Evaluating whether the fair value model being used is appropriate considering the Company’s circumstances and valuation premise identified. 
◦
Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.
◦
Testing the underlying source information and mathematical accuracy of the calculations.
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, for the goodwill impairment assessment we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology, (2) peer group companies and resulting market multiples, and (3) the discount rate, by:
◦
Evaluating whether the fair value model being used is appropriate considering the Company’s circumstances and valuation premise identified.
◦
Evaluating the market multiples by considering the reasonableness of the selected peer group companies and comparing the multiples selected by management to management’s identified peer group companies. 
◦
Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.
◦
Testing the underlying source information and mathematical accuracy of the calculations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Shareholders
Littelfuse, Inc.

Opinion on internal control over financial reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Littelfuse, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses identified below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 28, 2024, of the Company and our report dated March 13, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Material weaknesses
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.               
Management identified a material weakness as the Company did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with its financial reporting requirements. Specifically, at certain of its non-U.S. manufacturing locations, the Company lacked sufficiently skilled operational and accounting personnel to ensure that internal control responsibilities were performed and aligned with internal control objectives.

Table of Contents

The material weakness in the control environment contributed to an additional material weakness related to the design and operating effectiveness of control activities over the existence of inventory at these locations. The Company did not maintain effective controls related to inventory cycle counts to validate existence of inventory, and consequently, the completeness and accuracy of the data used in evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation of inventory and related reserves. 
These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 28, 2024, of the Company, and this report does not affect our report on such financial statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information

Nature of Operations

Littelfuse, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a diversified, industrial technology manufacturing company empowering a sustainable, connected, and safer world. Across more than 
20
 countries, and with approximately 
16,000
 global associates, the Company partners with customers to design and deliver innovative, reliable solutions. Serving over 
100,000
 end customers, the Company’s products are found in a variety of industrial, transportation and electronics end markets – everywhere, every day.
Fiscal Year

References herein to “2024”, “fiscal 2024” or “fiscal year 2024” refer to the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024. References herein to “2023”, “fiscal 2023” or “fiscal year 2023” refer to the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. References herein to “2022”, “fiscal 2022” or “fiscal year 2022” refer to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The Company operates on a 52-53 week fiscal year (4-4-5 basis) ending on the Saturday closest to December 31.

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Littelfuse, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S.") and include the assets, liabilities, sales and expenses of all wholly owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control.

Out-of-Period Adjustments
During the year ended December 28, 2024, the Company identified certain errors in its previously issued financial statements that have now been corrected through cumulative out-of-period adjustments in the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 28, 2024. The error was identified by management and related to the valuation and existence of inventory that originated in prior periods at certain of our non-U.S. manufacturing locations within the Transportation and Industrial segments. As a result, the Company recorded an out-of-period adjustment to the prior years of $
12.3
 million in the year ended December 28, 2024. The adjustment increased cost of sales, offset by a reduction in inventory. The out-of-period adjustment resulted in a decrease to net income of $
12.3
 million. The Company evaluated the impact of the error and out-of-period adjustment and concluded it was not material to any previously issued financial statements and the adjustment was not material to the year ended December 28, 2024.
Use of Estimates

The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the accompanying notes. The Company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in its evaluation, as considered necessary. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

All highly liquid investments, with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents. The Company
 maintains 
several pools including multicurrency notional pools and physical pools internationally and a zero-balance account ("ZBA") structure in the U.S.
 In the notional pools, actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. The Company will classify any overdraft balances within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

0.6
 million and a gain $
0.5
 million from its equity method investments for both the fiscal years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, recorded in 
Other (income) expense, net,
 in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income. The balance of these equity method investments was $
13.1
 million and $

The Company has investments related to its non-qualified Supplemental Retirement and Savings Plan. The Company maintains accounts for participants through which participants make investment elections. The investment securities are subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors. The investment securities are all mutual funds. The investment securities are measured at net asset value. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the investment securities balance was $
23.3
 million and $
20.1
 million, respectively, related to the plan and are included in 
Other long-term assets
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Trade Receivables

The Company performs credit evaluations of customers’ financial condition and generally does not require collateral. A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within agreed upon invoice terms. Write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible.

The Company also maintains allowances against trade receivables for the settlement of rebates and sales discounts to customers. These allowances are based upon specific customer sales and sales discounts as well as actual historical experience.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which approximates current replacement cost. Cost is principally determined using the first-in, first-out method. The Company maintains excess and obsolete reserves against inventory to reduce the carrying value to the expected net realizable value. These reserves are based upon a combination of factors including historical sales volume, market conditions, and lower of cost or net realizable value of the inventory.

Property, Plant,

and Equipment

Land, buildings, and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method with useful lives of up to 
35
 years for buildings, 
three
 to 
20
 years for equipment, 
seven years
 for furniture and fixtures, 
five years
 for tooling, and 
three years
 for computer equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful life or the lease term. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Major overhauls that extend the useful lives of existing assets are capitalized.

Goodwill

58
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
The results of the goodwill impairment test as of September 29, 2024 indicated that the estimated fair values for the Industrial controls and sensors and Automotive sensors reporting units were below their respective carrying values. Accordingly, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $
36.1
 million and $
8.6
 million, respectively, to reflect the impairment of goodwill for the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit within the Industrial segment and the Automotive sensors reporting unit within the Transportation segment. As a result of these impairment charges, the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit had $
115.2
 million of goodwill as of December 28, 2024. There was 
no
 goodwill remaining within the Automotive sensors reporting unit as of December 28, 2024. For the remainder of the Company's reporting units: Electronics-Passive Products and Sensors, Electronics-Semiconductor, Passenger Car Products, Commercial Vehicle Products, and Industrial Circuit Protection, the results of the goodwill impairment test as of September 29, 2024 indicated that their estimated fair values exceeded their respective carrying values.
The Company compares each reporting unit’s fair value, estimated based on comparable company market valuations and expected future discounted cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit, to its carrying value. With the exception of the Industrial controls and sensors and the Automotive sensors reporting units, the other 
five
 reporting units passed the most recent annual test conducted on September 29, 2024 with estimated fair values that exceeded the carrying values by 
108
%, 
82
%, 
96
%, 
44
%, and 
409
% for its reporting units: Electronics-Passive Products and Sensors, Electronics-Semiconductor, Passenger Car Products, Commercial Vehicle Products, and Industrial Circuit Protection, respectively. Relatively small changes in the Company’s key assumptions would not have resulted in any reporting units failing the goodwill impairment test. See Note 5, 
Goodwill

and Other Intangible Assets,
 for additional information. 
There were 
no
 impairment charges recorded during the fiscal years of 2023 and 2022.
The Company also performs an interim review for indicators of impairment each quarter to assess whether an interim impairment review is required for any reporting unit. As part of its interim reviews, management analyzes potential changes in the value of individual reporting units based on each reporting unit’s operating results for the period compared to expected results as of the prior year’s annual impairment test. In addition, management considers how other key assumptions, including discount rates and expected long-term growth rates, used in the last annual impairment test, could be impacted by changes in market conditions and economic events. Based on the interim assessments as of December 28, 2024, management concluded that no events or changes in circumstances indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value for any reporting unit had declined below its carrying value.

Long-Lived Assets

During the fourth quarter of  2024, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $
47.8
 million for the impairment of intangible assets, including $
47.6
 million related to the 
impairment
 of certain acquired customer relationships, developed technology, and tradename in the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit within the Industrial segment. The impairment of the intangible assets resulted from lower expectations of future revenue and cash flows driven by lower-than-expected demand in the electrical vehicle end market as well as reduced government funding to support charging infrastructures for electric vehicles, primarily in Europe. The fair value was determined using Level 3 inputs and estimated based on cash flow analyses, which included management’s assumptions related to future revenues and profitability. The remaining impairment charges included $
0.2
 million for patents and customer relationships related to exit of a small business in China within the Industrial segment. See Note 5, 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 for additional information. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2024, the Company recognized a $
0.9
 million impairment related to certain machinery and equipment in the commercial vehicle business within the Transportation segment. 
Customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives that have a range of 
3
 to 
20
 years. Patents, licenses, and software are amortized using the straight-line method or an accelerated method over estimated useful lives that have a range of 
4
 to 
17
 years. The distribution networks are amortized on either a straight-line or accelerated basis over estimated useful lives that have a range of 
4
 to 
10
 years. Land use rights are amortized using the straight-line method up to 
50
 years which is the term of the land use rights.

The Company assesses potential impairments to its long-lived assets if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based upon the most recent information available. Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows. Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other intangible assets, which are held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or the fair market value less the estimated cost to sell.

Environmental Liabilities

Environmental liabilities are accrued based on engineering studies estimating the cost of remediating sites. Expenses related to on-going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred. If actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the Company’s recorded liability for such claims, the Company would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.

Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits

The Company records annual income and expense amounts relating to its pension and post-retirement benefits plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected long-term rates of return and compensation increases. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis as of the fiscal year-end balance sheet date (or more frequently if a significant event requiring remeasurement occurs) and modifies the assumption based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effects of modifications are recognized immediately on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, but are generally amortized into operating earnings over future periods, with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and input from its actuaries and investment advisors.

Segment Information,
 for net sales by segment and country.

The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the Company satisfies its performance obligation and control of the product is transferred to the customer. The Company’s sales arrangements with customers are predominately short term in nature and generally provide for transfer of control at the time of shipment as this is the point at which title and risk of loss of the product transfers to the customer. At the end of each period, for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer, the Company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer. The amount of revenue recorded reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods and may include adjustments for customer allowance, rebates, and price adjustments. The Company’s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third-party distributors.

The Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 to expense commissions when incurred as the amortization period of the commission asset the Company would have otherwise recognized is less than one year.

Revenue and Billing

The Company generally accepts orders from customers through receipt of purchase orders or electronic data interchange based on written sales agreements and purchasing contracts. Contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors, costs, and competition. Pricing is often negotiated as an adjustment (premium or discount) from the Company’s published price lists. The customer is invoiced when the Company’s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement. As the Company’s standard payment terms are less than one year, the Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. The Company also elected the practical expedient provided in ASC 606-10-25-18B to treat all product shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities, and therefore recognize the gross revenue associated with the contract, inclusive of any shipping and handling revenue.

Ship and Debit Program

Some of the terms of the Company’s sales agreements and normal business conditions provide customers (distributors) the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced. This practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a “ship and debit” program. This program allows the distributors to debit the Company for the difference between the distributors’ contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions. Under certain circumstances (usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity), a distributor will request authorization for pricing allowances to reduce its price. When the Company approves such a reduction, the distributor is authorized to “debit” its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price. The Company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity, distributor inventory levels and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue.
Return to Stock

The Company has a return to stock policy whereby certain customers, with prior authorization from the Company's management, can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit. The Company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity. Sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns.

Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Volume Rebates

The Company offers volume-based sales incentives to certain customers to encourage greater product sales. If customers achieve their specific quarterly or annual sales targets, they are entitled to rebates. The Company estimates the projected amount of rebates that will be achieved by the customer and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company currently measures the expected credit losses based on our historical credit loss experience. The Company has not experienced significant recent or historical credit losses and is not forecasting any significant credit losses which would require adjustments to our methodology. If current conditions and supportable forecasts indicate that our historical loss experience is not reasonable and no longer supportable, the Company may adjust its historical credit loss experience and to reflect these conditions and forecasts. The Company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and, when the Company becomes aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible. The Company also analyzes all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, macroeconomic considerations and historical collection and loss experience. Historically, the allowance for credit losses has been adequate to cover bad debts. If circumstances related to specific customers change, the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company’s allowance for credit losses was $
1.6
 million and $
2.2
 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company had $
3.8
 million and $
5.4
 million of trade receivables greater than 90 days past due as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.
Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred,
 which amounted to $
5.0
 million, $
4.0
 million, and $
3.8
 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs

Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as revenue. Costs incurred for shipping and handlin
g of $
15.3
 million, $
15.4
 million, and $
13.9
 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, are classified in selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Foreign Currency Translation

/

Remeasurement

The Company’s foreign subsidiaries use the local currency or the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, as appropriate. Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average rates. Adjustments from the translation process are recognized in Shareholders’ equity as a component of 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
.
 The amount of foreign currency (gain) or loss recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income were (gain) loss of $(
9.2
) million, $
12.3
 million, and $
24.4
 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes compensation expense for the cost of awards of equity compensation using a fair value method. Benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported as operating cash flows. See Note 12, 
Stock-Based Compensation
, for additional information on stock-based compensation.
Coal Mining Liability
Included in accrued liabilities is an accrual related to former coal mining operations at Littelfuse GmbH (formerly known as Heinrich Industries, AG) for the amounts of €
2.2
 million ($
2.3
 million) and €
2.5
 million ($
2.7
 million) at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. Management, in conjunction with an independent third-party, performs an annual evaluation of the former coal mining operations in order to develop an estimate of the probable future obligations in regard to remediating the dangers (such as a shaft collapse) of abandoned coal mine shafts in the former coal mining operations. Management accrues for costs associated with such remediation efforts based on management's best estimate when such costs

are probable and reasonably able to be estimated. The ultimate determination can only be done after respective investigations because the concrete conditions are mostly unknown at this time.

Other (Income) Expense, Net

Other (income) expense, net generally consists of interest income, royalties, change in fair value of available-for-sale securities, pension non-service costs and settlements and other non-operating (income) expense.
 The amount of interest income included in Other (income) expense, net, was $
28.0
 million, $
18.9
 million, and $
5.0
 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes are recognized for the future effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes deferred taxes for temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards, and tax credit and other tax attribute carryforwards (excluding carryforwards where usage has been determined to be remote). Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. U.S. state and non-U.S. income taxes are provided on the portion of non-U.S. income that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable (and non-U.S. income taxes are provided on the portion of non-U.S. income that is expected to be remitted to an upper-tier non-U.S. entity). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
Deferred U.S. income taxes and non-U.S. taxes are not provided on the excess of the investment value for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in those non-U.S. subsidiaries for which such excess is considered to be permanently reinvested in those operations. Management regularly evaluates whether non-U.S. earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. This evaluation requires judgment about the future operating and liquidity needs of the Company and its non-U.S. subsidiaries. Changes in economic and business conditions, tax laws, or the Company’s financial situation could result in changes to these judgments and the need to record additional tax liabilities.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), among other things, imposed a one-time tax (the “Toll Charge”) on accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and included base broadening provisions commonly referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income provisions ("GILTI"). 
T
he Company elected to pay the 2017 Littelfuse Toll Charge over the eight-year period prescribed by the Tax Act. The anticipated 2025 annual installment payment of this Toll Charge of $
8.2
 million, which represents the eighth and final required installment, is included in 
Accrued income taxes
, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 28, 2024.
In accordance with guidance issued by the FASB staff, the Company has adopted an accounting policy to treat any GILTI inclusions as a period cost if and when incurred. Thus, for the fiscal years ended 
December 28, 2024
, December 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, deferred taxes were computed without consideration of the possible future impact of the GILTI provisions, and any current year impact was recorded as a part of the current portion of income tax expen
se.

Fair Value Measurements

Certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company records the fair value of its available-for-sale securities and pension plan assets on a recurring basis. Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include long-lived assets held and used, long-lived assets held for sale, goodwill, and other intangible assets. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying values. The three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes valuation methodologies based on the reliability of the inputs, is:

Level 1
 – Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
63
Table of Contents
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Level 2
 – Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3
 – Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.

Recently

Adopted

Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Updates ("ASU") No. 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures." The amendments in this update require additional detailed and enhanced information about reportable segments' expense, including significant segment expenses and other segment items that bridge segment revenue, significant expenses to segment profit or loss. The ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) on an annual basis as well as an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures and other disclosures. The amendments in this update do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 modified the Company's disclosures in its Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 16, 
Segment Information
, for more details. 
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-01, "Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements." The standard requires that leasehold improvements associated with common control leases be: 1) Amortized by the lessee over the useful life of the leasehold improvements to the common control group (regardless of the lease term) as long as the lessee controls the use of the underlying asset (the leased asset) through a lease. However, if the lessor obtained the right to control the use of the underlying asset through a lease with another entity not within the same common control group, the amortization period may not exceed the amortization period of the common control group. 2) Accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control through an adjustment to equity (or net assets for not-for-profit entities) if, and when, the lessee no longer controls the use of the underlying asset. Additionally, those leasehold improvements are subject to the impairment guidance in Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2023-01 did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)." The amendments in this update require disclosure, in the notes to financial statements, of specified information about certain costs and expenses. The amendments require that at each interim and annual reporting period an entity (a) disclose the amounts of (i) purchases of inventory, (ii) employee compensation, (iii) depreciation, (iv) intangible asset amortization, and (v) depreciation, depletion, and amortization recognized as part of oil and gas producing activities ("DD&A") included in each relevant expense caption. A relevant expense caption is an expense caption presented on the face of the income statement within continuing operations that contains any of the expense categories listed in (i)–(v); (b) include certain amounts that are already required to be disclosed under current Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") in the same disclosure as the other disaggregation requirements; (c) disclose a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively; (d) disclose the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance will increase the Company's disclosures in its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on the disclosures in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures." The amendments in this update provide more transparency about income tax information through improvements to the income tax disclosure primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. These requirements include: (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The other amendments in this update improve the effectiveness and comparability of disclosures by (3) adding disclosures of pretax income (or loss) and income tax expense (or benefit), and (4) removing disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial or relevant. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance will modify our disclosures in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, "Disclosure Improvements." The amendments in this update represent changes to clarify or improve the disclosure or presentation requirements of a variety of Topics in the ASC. The Company may be affected by one or more of those amendments. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively and will not be effective until June 30, 2027. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of these amendments on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Acquisitions

The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” in which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. The operating results of the acquired businesses are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition.

Dortmund Fab
On December 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of a 200mm wafer fab located in Dortmund, Germany (“Dortmund Fab”) from Elmos Semiconductor SE. The total purchase price for the Dortmund Fab is approximately 
94
 million Euro, of which a 
37.2
 million Euro down payment (approximately $
40.5
 million) was recorded in 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets
 in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The down payment was paid in the third quarter of 2023 after regulatory approvals, and 
56.7

(a) The additions resulted from the acquisitions of Western Automation and C&K Switches.

The Company tests its goodwill annually for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The results of the goodwill impairment test as of September 29, 2024 indicated that the estimated fair values for the Industrial controls and sensors and Automotive sensors reporting units were below their respective carrying values. Accordingly, the Company recorded non-cash charges of $
36.1
 million and $
8.6
 million, respectively, to reflect the impairment of goodwill for the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit within the Industrial segment and the Automotive sensors reporting unit within the Transportation segment. There were 
no
 impairment charges recorded during the fiscal years of 2023 and 2022.
The goodwill impairment charge for the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit was due to reduction in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit based on lower expectations for future revenue, profitability and cash flows as compared to the expectations of the 2023 annual goodwill impairment test driven by lower-than-expected demand in the electric vehicle end market as well as reduced government funding to support charging infrastructures for electric vehicles, primarily in Europe. 
69
The goodwill impairment charge for the Automotive sensors reporting unit was due to reductions in the estimated fair value for the automotive sensors reporting unit based on lower expectations for future revenue, profitability and cash flows as compared to the expectations of the 2023 annual goodwill impairment test. These lower future expectations were driven by projected declines in end market demand and reduced revenue and profitability with existing customers.
The goodwill impairment charge was determined using Level 3 inputs, including discounted cash flow analysis and comparable marketplace fair value data. As of December 28, 2024, the Industrial controls and sensors reporting unit had $
115.2
 million of remaining goodwill, and the Automotive sensors reporting unit had 
no
 remaining goodwill.

The remaining impairment charges included $
0.2
 million for patents and customer relationships related to the exit of a small business in China within Industrial segment. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company recognized a $

7. 
Lease Commitments
Under ASC 842, a contract contains a lease if there is an identified asset and the Company has the right to control the asset. The Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at contract inception. The Company leases office and production space under various non-cancellable operating leases that expire 
no later
 than 2036. Certain real estate leases include 
one
 or more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion. Options to extend the lease are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. The Company also has production equipment, office equipment and vehicles under operating leases and finance leases that were acquired through the C&K acquisition. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option that is reasonably certain of exercise. Certain leases include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. The lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantee or material restrictive covenants. The Company has elected to use the available practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease components of its leases as a single component. As the Company elected not to separate lease and non-lease components and instead to account for them as a single lease component, the variable lease cost primarily represents variable payments such as common area maintenance and utilities.
The Company does not have a published credit rating because it has no publicly traded debt; therefore, the Company is generating its incremental borrowing rate ("IBR"), using a synthetic credit rating model that compares its credit quality to other rated companies based on certain financial metrics and ratios. The reference rate will be based on the yield curve of companies with similar credit quality based on the metrics and adjusted for currency in regions where we have significant operations.
All leases with an initial term of 12 months or less that do not include an option to extend or purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise (“short-term leases”) are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Short-term lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan
On June 30, 2022, the Company amended and restated its Credit Agreement, dated as of April 3, 2020 (as so amended and restated, the “Credit Agreement”) to effect certain changes, including, among other changes: (i) adding a $
300
 million unsecured term loan credit facility; (ii) making certain financial and non-financial covenants less restrictive on the Company and its subsidiaries; (iii) replacing LIBOR-based interest rate benchmarks and modifying performance-based interest rate margins; and (iv) extending the maturity date to June 30, 2027 (the “Maturity Date”). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Company may, from time to time, increase the size of the revolving credit facility or enter into one or more tranches of term loans in minimum increments of $
25
 million if there is no event of default and the Company is in compliance with certain financial covenants.
Loans made under the available credit facility pursuant to the Credit Agreement ("the Credit Facility") bear interest at the Company’s option, at either SOFR, fixed for interest periods of one, two, three or six-month periods, plus 
1.00
% to 
1.75
%, plus a SOFR adjustment of 
0.10
% or at the bank’s Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus 
0.00
% to 
0.75
%, based upon the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company is also required to pay commitment fees on unused portions of the Credit Facility ranging from 
0.10
% to 
0.175
%, based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement includes representations, covenants and events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature.
Under the Credit Agreement, revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until the Maturity Date, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. The Company borrowed $
300.0
 million under a term loan on June 30, 2022. The principal balance of the term loans must be repaid in quarterly installments on the last day of each calendar quarter in the amount of $
1.9
 million commencing September 30, 2022, through June 30, 2024, and in the amount of $
3.8
 million commencing September 30, 2024, through March 31, 2027, with the remaining outstanding principal balance payable in full on the Maturity Date. Accrued interest on the loans is payable in arrears on each interest payment date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified in the Credit Agreement. Subject to certain conditions, (i) the Company may terminate or reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, as defined in the Credit Agreement, in whole or in part, and (ii) the Company may prepay the revolving loans or the term loans at any time, without premium or penalty. During the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, the Company made term loan payments of $
7.5
 million. The revolving loan and term loan balance under the Credit Facility was $
100.0
 million and $
281.3
 million, respectively, as of December 28, 2024.
On May 12, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk exposure, effectively converting the interest rate on the Company's SOFR based floating-rate loans to a fixed-rate. The interest rate swap, with a notional value of $
200
 million, was designated as a cash flow hedge against the variability of cash flows associated with the Company's SOFR based loans scheduled to mature on June 30, 2027.
As of December 28, 2024, the effective interest rate on unhedged portion of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility was 
5.71
%, and 
4.13
% on the hedged portion. 
75
As of December 28, 2024, the Company had $
0.1
 million outstanding in letters of credit and had available $
599.9
 million of borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. As of December 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement.

Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities
For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis, a three-level hierarchy of measurements based upon observable and unobservable inputs is used to arrive at fair value. Observable inputs are developed based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s assumptions about valuation based on the best information available in the circumstances. Depending on the inputs, the Company classifies each fair value measurement as follows:

Level 1
—Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;

Level 2
—Valuations based upon quoted prices for similar instruments, prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-derived valuations, all of whose significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data;

Level 3
—Valuations based upon one or more significant unobservable inputs;

There were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year ended 
December 28, 2024
.
Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value and their classification in the valuation hierarchy.
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds, certificates of deposit, and short-term time deposits, which are held with institutions with sound credit ratings and are highly liquid. The Company classified cash equivalents as Level 1 and are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.

Investments in Equity Securities

Investments in equity securities listed on a national market or exchange are valued at the last sales price and classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Such securities are further detailed in Note 1, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information
.
Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments
For derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective, and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at the inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. For highly effective cash flow hedges, ASC 815 requires the entire 
77
change in fair value of the hedging instrument included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to be recorded in other comprehensive income. No components of the Company's hedging instruments were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
Zero Cost Collar Agreement
In July 2024, the Company implemented a hedging program to manage foreign currency risk exposure related to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and Mexican peso. These foreign currency zero cost collars are designated as cash flow hedges for a portion of our Mexican peso-denominated manufacturing expenses, predominantly salary expenses, vendor payments, and utility expenses. The collars that were entered on July 3, 2024, mature on August 29, 2025 at a weighted-average ceiling of 
19.435
 and a weighted-average floor of 
18.000
. The collars that were entered on August 5, 2024, mature on September 29, 2025 at a weighted-average ceiling of 
21.000
 and a weighted-average floor of 
19.655
. The collars that were entered on September 3, 2024, mature on November 3, 2025 at a weighted-average ceiling of 
21.757
 and a weighted-average floor of 
20.082
. The collars that were entered on September 30, 2024, mature on November 26, 2025 at a weighted-average ceiling of 
21.365
 and a weighted-average floor of 
19.870
. The collars that were entered on November 4, 2024, mature on January 2, 2026 at a weighted-average ceiling of 
21.690
 and a weighted-average floor of 
20.120
. The collars that were entered on December 2, 2024, mature on February 2, 2026 at a weighted-average ceiling of 
22.0377
 and a weighted-average floor of 
20.425
. If the spot rate is between the weighted-average ceiling and floor rates on the date of maturity, then the Company would not owe or receive any payments under these collars. The Company plans to continue executing zero cost collars with 14-month rolling maturities as an ongoing strategy to hedge peso-denominated manufacturing expenses.
The fair value of the collars was determined using an independent third-party valuation model. Pursuant to this model, changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the underlying transactions are recognized in earnings. For the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, the Company recorded a pre-tax unrealized loss on the collars of $
3.5
 million. The Company estimates that approximately $
3.6
 million of pre-tax losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be recognized in earnings over the next 12 months. The amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to earnings should the hedge no longer be considered effective. No amount of ineffectiveness was included in net income for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024. The Company will continue to assess the effectiveness of the hedge on an ongoing basis. The primary inputs into the valuation of the collars are interest yield curves, interest rate volatilities, foreign exchange rates, foreign exchange volatilities, credit risk, credit spreads and other market information. The collars are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy since all significant inputs are corroborated by market observable data.
Interest Rate Swap
On May 12, 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk exposure, effectively converting the interest rate on the Company's SOFR based floating-rate loans to a fixed-rate. The interest rate swap, with a notional value of $
200
 million, was designated as a cash flow hedge against the variability of cash flows associated with the Company's SOFR based loans scheduled to mature on June 30, 2027. The fair value of the interest rate swap was valued using an independent third-party valuation model. Pursuant to this model, c
hanges in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income until the underlying transactions are recognized in earnings.
 For the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, the Company recorded a pre-tax unrealized gain on the interest rate swap of $
0.3
 million. The Company estimates that approximately $
2.7
 million of pre-tax gain currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be recognized in earnings over the next 12 months. The primary inputs into the valuation of the interest rate swap are interest yield curves, interest rate volatility, credit risk, credit spreads and other market information. The interest rate swap is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy since all significant inputs are corroborated by observable market data. 
The use of derivatives creates exposure to credit risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized in the event that the counterparties to these instruments fail to perform their obligations under the contracts. The Company seeks to minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings and monitoring the total value of positions with individual counterparties. In the event of a default by one of our counterparties, the Company may not receive payments provided for under the terms of our derivatives.
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
On July 14, 2022, the Company entered into a foreign currency exchange forward contract to mitigate the currency fluctuation risk between the Euro and U.S. dollar on its Euro denominated Senior Notes, Series A due 2023. The notional value of the forward contract at July 14, 2022 was €
117
 million and expired on December 7, 2023 with the final settlement value of $
6.3
 million which the Company used to convert USD to Euro to pay down the €
117
 million of Euro Senior Notes, Series A due 2023. The foreign currency contract was not designated as a hedge instrument and was marked to market on a monthly 
78
basis. As a result, changes in fair value during 2023 were reported in 
Foreign exchange loss 
in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income. The fair value of the foreign currency forward contract was valued by a third party using market exchange rates and classified as a Level 2 input under the fair value hierarchy.
As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the fair values of our derivative financial instrument and their classifications on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

In addition to the methods and assumptions used for the financial instruments recorded at fair value as discussed above, the following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of other financial instruments that are not marked to market on a recurring basis. The Company’s other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables and its long-term debt. Due to their short-term maturity, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and trade receivables approximate their fair values. The Company’s revolving and term loan debt facilities’ fair values approximate book value at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, as the rates on these borrowings are variable in nature.

The carrying value and estimated fair values of the Company’s Euro Senior Notes, Series B and USD Senior Notes, Series A and Series B, as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were as follows:

Benefit Plans

The Company has Company-sponsored and mandatory defined benefit pension plans covering employees in the United Kingdom ("U.K."), Germany, the Philippines, China, Japan, Mexico, Italy, and France. The amount of the retirement benefits provided under the plans is generally based on years of service and final average pay.
On October 4, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a group annuity contract, under which an insurance company will be required to pay pension payments to the Company’s United Kingdom pension plan to match required pension payments until a later buyout, at which point the insurance company will directly pay and administer the benefits to the plan's participants, or to their designated beneficiaries. The purchase of this group annuity contract will reduce the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligation by approximately $
23
 million, representing approximately 
33
% of the total obligations of the Company’s qualified pension plans, and will be funded with pension plan assets and additional cash on 
81
hand. In connection with this transaction, the Company currently expects to record a one-time non-cash settlement charge in 2026 estimated between $
6
 million and $
8
 million, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. The actual settlement charge could differ from this estimate due to final data and plan wind-up expenses.

Defined Benefit Plan Assets

Based upon analysis of the target asset allocation and historical returns by type of investment, the Company has assumed that the expected long-term rate of return will be 
5.5
% on plan assets. Assets are invested to maximize long-term return taking into consideration timing of settlement of the retirement liabilities and liquidity needs for benefits payments.

The Company segregated its plan assets by the following major categories and level for determining their fair value as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. All plan assets that are valued using the net asset value per share (“NAV”) practical expedient have not been included within the fair value hierarchy, but are separately disclosed.
Cash and cash equivalents –
 Carrying value approximates fair value. As such, these assets were classified as Level 1. The Company also invests in certain short-term investments which are valued using the amortized cost method. Lastly, the Company has certain pooled pension funds that have short-term investments with third party mutual funds that are valued at unit value per share at measurement date.

As such, these assets were classified as Level 2.
Equity –
 The values of individual equity securities were based on quoted prices in active markets. As such, these assets are classified as Level 1. The Company has certain pooled pension funds which have mutual funds with underlying investments in certain equity securities that are not quoted on active markets; therefore, they were classified as Level 2.
Fixed income
 – Fixed income securities are typically priced based on a last trade basis and are exchange-traded. Accordingly, the Company classified fixed income securities as Level 1. The Company has certain pooled pension funds which have mutual funds with underlying investments in fixed income securities and funds priced based on a valuation model rather than a last trade basis and are not exchange-traded.

As such, they were classified as Level 2.

The Company also invests in certain fixed income funds which are valued at the NAV.
Insurance contracts and other 
– This category includes pooled pension funds which have mutual funds with underlying investments in other assets and liabilities including alternatives priced based on a valuation model and are not exchange-traded.

These were classified as Level 2. This category also includes insurance contracts that are valued by the re-insurer with the valuation inputs being not highly observable or traded on an open market.

Accordingly, insurance contracts were categorized as Level 3.

Lastly, this category includes other assets and liabilities including futures or swaps. 
Bulk Annuity Contract – 
Bulk annuity contract includes a U.K insurance policy issued by an authorized U.K. life insurer. This bulk annuity contract is valued by the re-insurer with the valuation inputs being not highly observable or traded on an open market. Accordingly, this contract was categorized as Level 3.
For any Level 2 and Level 3 plan assets, management reviews significant investments on a periodic basis including investigation of unusual fluctuations in price or returns and obtaining an understanding of the pricing methodology to assess the reliability of third-party pricing estimates.
The valuation methodologies described above may generate a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or future fair values. While the Company believes the valuation methodologies used are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions in calculating fair value could result in different amounts. The Company invests in assets in which valuation is determined by the NAV. The Company believes that the NAV is representative of fair value at the reporting date, as there are no significant restrictions on redemption of these investments or other reasons to indicate that the investment would be redeemed at an amount different than the NAV.

Defined Contribution Plan

The Company also maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. The Company matches 
100
% of the employee’s annual contributions for the first 
4
% of the employee’s eligible compensation. The Company may provide an additional discretionary match to participants and made discretionary matches of 
2
% of the employee’s eligible compensation for each of the fiscal years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Employees are immediately vested in their contributi
ons plus actual earnings thereon, as well as the Company contributions. Company matching contributions amounted to
 $
6.5
 million, $
7.7
 million, and $
5.5
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Non-qualified Supplemental Retirement and Savings Plan

The Company has a non-qualified Supplemental Retirement and Savings Plan which provides additional retirement benefits for certain management employees and named executive officers by allowing participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation. The Company maintains accounts for participants through which participants make investment elections. The investments are subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors and the Company is responsible for the payment of all benefits under the plan from its general assets. As of December 28, 2024, there was $
23.3
 million of marketable securities related to the plan included in 
Other long-term assets
 and $
23.3
 million of accrued compensation benefits included in 
Other long-term liabilities
. The marketable securities are classified as Level 1 under the fair value hierarchy as they are maintained in mutual funds with readily determinable fair value. The Company made matching contributions to the plan of $
0.5
 million, $
0.6
 million, and $
0.2
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock price. The expected life of options is based on historical data for options granted by the Company. The risk-free rates are based on yields available at the time of grant on U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities consistent with the expected life assumption. Historical nonvested forfeiture information is the basis for the forfeiture rate assumptions.
The fair value of RSU is determined based on the Company's stock price on the grant date reduced by the present value of expected dividends through the vesting period.

On October 4, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a group annuity contract, under which an insurance company will be required to pay pension payments to the Company’s United Kingdom pension plan to match required pension payments until a later buyout, at which point the insurance company will directly pay and administer the benefits to the plan's participants, or to their designated beneficiaries. The purchase of this group annuity contract will reduce the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligation by approximately $
23
 million, representing approximately 
33
% of the total obligations of the Company’s qualified pension plans, and will be funded with pension plan assets and additional cash on hand. In connection with this transaction, the Company currently expects to record a one-time non-cash settlement charge in 2026 estimated between $
6
 million and $
8
 million, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. The actual settlement charge could differ from this estimate due to final data and plan wind-up expenses.
Due to the signing of the group annuity contract for the U.K. pension plan, the liabilities of the plan were remeasured as of October 4, 2024 resulting in an increase of $
3.8
 million to unamortized actuarial loss within other comprehensive income (loss). See Note 11, 
Benefits Plans
 for further discussion.
Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 were as follows:

Income Taxes

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), among other things, imposed a one-time tax (the “Toll Charge”) on accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries and included base broadening provisions commonly referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income provisions ("GILTI"). 
T
he Company elected to pay the 2017 Littelfuse Toll Charge over the eight-year period prescribed by the Tax Act. The anticipated 2025 annual installment payment of this Toll Charge of $
8.2
 million, which represents the eighth and final required installment, is included in 
Accrued income taxes
, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 28, 2024.
In accordance with guidance issued by the FASB staff, the Company has adopted an accounting policy to treat any GILTI inclusions as a period cost if and when incurred. Thus, for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2024, December 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, deferred taxes were computed without consideration of the possible future impact of the GILTI provisions, and any current year impact was recorded as a part of the current portion of income tax expense.

The deferred tax asset valuation allowance is mainly related to certain U.S. and non-U.S. net operating loss and non-U.S. interest expense carryforwards which are not more likely that not to be realized. The remaining U.S. and non-U.S. net operating loss and interest expense carryforwards either have no expiration date or are expected to be utilized prior to expiration (which begin expiring in 2025). No deferred tax asset nor valuation allowance has been recorded for certain U.S. and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for which the possibility of usage has been determined to be remote.

The Company paid income taxes of $
88.1
 million, $
81.1
 million, and $
96.8
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and received income tax refunds of $
4.3
 million, $
7.2
 million, and $
3.2
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Deferred income taxes are not provided on the excess of the investment value for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in those subsidiaries for which such excess is considered to be permanently reinvested in those operations. The Company believes the determination of the amount of such deferred income taxes is impractical as it would depend upon income tax laws and circumstances at the time of the hypothetical distributions or dispo
sitions. As of December 28, 2024, unremitted earnings of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries were approximately $
1.5
 billion. A distribution of such earnings will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. The Company recognized deferred tax liabilities of $
14.6
 million as of December 28, 2024 and $
18.6
 million as of December 30, 2023, related to taxes on certain non-U.S. earnings which are not considered to be permanently reinvested. 

The Company has two subsidiaries in China which benefit from lower tax rates due to “tax holidays” which apply for three-year periods. The tax holiday for one of the subsidiaries expired at the end of 2023, but was later extended for an additional three years, retroactive to include all of 2024, as well as 2025 and 2026, and for the other subsidiary the tax holiday will expire at the end of 2025. Together, the tax holidays contributed $
5.0
 million in tax benefits, or $
0.20
 per diluted share, during 2024. Future year tax benefits will depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain extensions, after the three-year periods expire. There can be no assurance that future extensions will be granted.

The December 28, 2024 total in the table above represents the net amount of tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in future periods. Of this amount, approximately $
6.3
 million

may be recognized in 2025 based upon the possible lapse in the statute of limitations. None of the positions included in unrecognized tax benefits are related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense. The Company recognized such interest benefit of $
2.7
 million (including a $
4.1
 million decrease due to a lapse in the statute of limitations), $
0.5
 million expense (net of a $
1.7
 million decrease due to a lapse in the statute of limitations) and $
1.4
 million expense (net of a $
0.2
 million decrease due to a lapse in the statute of limitations) in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Accrued interest for such matters included in 
Other long-term liabilities 
within the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $
11.1
 million and $
14.4
 million as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.

The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the Company for the 2018 tax year and later years. Non-U.S. and U.S. state statutes of limitations generally range from three to seven years, although certain jurisdictions do not have a statute expiration. Tax examinations occur from time to time, including examinations currently in process in Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, other non-U.S. jurisdictions and certain U.S. states. The Company does not expect to recognize a significant amount of additional tax expense as a result of concluding these examinations.

16. 
Segment Information

The Company and its subsidiaries design, manufacture and sell component, modules and subassemblies to empower the long-term structural themes of sustainability, connectivity and safety. The Company aggregated its operating segments into the reportable segments: Electronics, Transportation, and Industrial. An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, and about which separate financial information is regularly evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources. The CODM is the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The CODM allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about its revenue and operating income (loss) before interest and taxes, but does not evaluate the operating segments using discrete balance sheet information and as such, segment asset information is not disclosed. The CODM’s key decisions involve the allocation of resources, such as acquisitions, divestitures, investments, capital expenditures, significant customer contracts, and other key management resources, and assessment of performance, such as executive officer hiring, promotion, and compensation. The CODM uses operating income as the key metric when establishing targets in the annual budget and in evaluating the allocation of resources to each segment. The CODM regularly reviews each segment's operating income against the forecast, budget and previous quarterly results to assess performance and make decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment. 

Sales, marketing, and research and development expenses are charged directly into each operating segment. Finance, information technology, and human resources are shared functions that are allocated back to the operating segments. The Company does not report inter-segment revenue because the operating segments do not record it. Certain expenses, determined by the CODM to be strategic in nature and not directly related to segments current results, are not allocated but identified as “Other.” Additionally, the Company does not allocate interest and other income, interest expense, or taxes to operating segments. These costs are not allocated to the segments, as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments. Except as discussed above, the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for the Company as a whole.

Commitments and Contingencies
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 28, 2024, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules. Specifically, the Company was not liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties, the Company was not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity and the Company did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets. The Company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.
Product Warranty Liabilities
The Company's policy is to accrue for warranty claims when a loss is both probable and estimable. Liabilities for warranty claims have historically not been material and in limited instances, customers may make claims for costs they incurred or other damages related to a claim.
The Company carries insurance for potential product liability claims at coverage levels based on the Company's prior claims experience. This coverage is subject to deductibles, and various terms and conditions. The Company cannot assure that the level of coverage will be sufficient to cover every possible claim that can arise in its businesses, now or in the future, or that such coverage always will be available should the Company, now or in the future, wish to extend, increase or otherwise adjust its insurance.
The Company has been notified by one of its customers of a product recall potentially due to certain fuses provided by Littelfuse and incorporated in such products. The Company is currently working with its customer to investigate the cause and level of responsibility for this recall. The Company has determined pursuant to ASC 450, "Contingencies
", 
that a loss is reasonably possible. However, the Company continues to evaluate this matter and the ultimate costs of the recall and range of the potential loss cannot be determined at this time. Accordingly, no accrual has been made yet for this matter. Factors that will impact the amount of such losses include the per vehicle cost of fuse replacement, the determination of the relative liability among the customer, the Company, and any relevant third parties, as well as actual insurance recoveries
.
Environmental Remediation Liabilities 
Refer to Note 1: 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Information 
related to environmental liabilities. Our operations and facilities are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and our employees, including those governing air emissions, chemical usage, water discharges, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, or third-party property damage or personal injury claims, in the event of violations or liabilities under these laws and regulations, or non-compliance with the environmental permits required at our facilities. Potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with environmental laws that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are, however, not aware of any threatened or pending material environmental investigations, lawsuits, or claims involving the Company or its operations.
Legal Proceedings
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may be involved in a number of claims and litigation matters. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters, based upon our experience and current information known to us, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and/or cash flows.
The Company accounts for litigation and claims losses in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450, 
Contingencies 
where loss contingency provisions are recognized for probable and estimable losses at our best estimate of a loss or, when a best estimate cannot be made, at our estimate of the minimum loss. These estimates require the application of considerable judgment and are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known. We are often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount, which could be an immaterial amount, is recognized. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, or a best estimate can be made, resulting in additional loss provisions. A best estimate may be changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. 
Pending Litigation and Claims
There are no material pending litigation or claims outstanding as of December 28, 2024.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Company recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and the Company is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As required by SEC Rule 15d-15(b), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to SEC Rule 13a-15 and based upon the updated framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 28, 2024

due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below.
Notwithstanding the conclusion by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 28, 2024 were not effective, and notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements for all periods involved fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows at and for the periods presented. 
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
99
Table of Contents

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“the COSO Framework). The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to its management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024. This report is included with this Form 10-K.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal controls over financial reporting are subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, and the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may be inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.
Material Weakness
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statement will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Based on the Company’s assessment, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that, as of December 28, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the identification of the material weaknesses described below. In making this assessment, management has concluded that we did not design and maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. Specifically, at certain of our non-U.S. manufacturing locations we lacked sufficiently skilled operational and accounting personnel to ensure that internal control responsibilities were performed and aligned with internal control objectives.
The material weakness in the control environment contributed to an additional material weakness related to the design and operating effectiveness of control activities over the existence of inventory at these locations. The Company did not maintain effective controls related to inventory cycle counts to validate existence of inventory, and consequently, the completeness and accuracy of the data used in evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation of inventory and related reserves. These material weaknesses resulted in corrections through cumulative out-of-period adjustments as described in notes to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 28, 2024. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Except as otherwise described above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control performed during the fiscal quarter ended December 28, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses
Our management team is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. The Company, with oversight from our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, is taking comprehensive actions to remediate the material weaknesses. The Company has developed and is in the process of implementing its remediation plan, which will include the following steps:
Control environment
•
recruiting of personnel with appropriate internal controls, and accounting knowledge and experience commensurate with our accounting and reporting requirements;
•
enhanced supervision of personnel at certain locations to ensure compliance with established Company policies; and
100
Table of Contents

•
evaluating and updating (as appropriate) the sufficiency of policies and training provided to personnel to ensure the appropriate segregation of duties and adherence to the Code of Conduct. 
Control activities 
•
augmentation of training and clear instruction as to the process for recording of adjustments to inventories; 
•
full physical inventory observations, facilitated by independent counters, until the cycle count and related inventory existence controls at certain of our non-U.S. manufacturing locations are operating effectively;
•
implementation of a management review control over inventory movements;
•
examination and enhancement of the procedures to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of data and assumptions utilized in computing inventory reserves.
We intend to remediate the material weaknesses as soon as possible; however, the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the appropriate controls are operating effectively.

In connection with the acquisition of IXYS, we assumed the IXYS Corporation 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, IXYS Corporation 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, IXYS Corporation 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, IXYS Corporation 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and outstanding unvested stock options originally granted by IXYS Corporation under the IXYS Plans that were held by continuing employees. At the time of the acquisition of IXYS Corporation, these awards were converted to Littelfuse stock options, with adjustments made to the exercise price of the stock options and the number of shares subject to stock options as agreed upon in the Acquisition Agreement. These unvested options vest in accordance with their original terms, generally vesting in equal annual installments over a four-year period from the original grant date. The options, once granted, generally expire ten years from the date of grant. Under the IXYS Plans, we may grant to former employees of IXYS Corporation or its subsidiaries restricted stock awards, RSUs, stock options and stock appreciation rights with an exercise price that is no less than the fair market value on the date of grant. Equity awards granted under the IXYS Plans following the acquisition have been on similar terms and consistent with grants made pursuant to the Littelfuse, Inc Long-Term Incentive Plan. The IXYS Corporation 2009, 2011, 2013 Equity Incentive Plans expired in June 2019, June 2021 and June 2023, respectively, with no additional grants made after the expiration date. As of December 28, 2024, 114,134 shares remained available for issuance under the IXYS Plans.
Zilog Plans
In connection with the acquisition of IXYS Corporation, we assumed the Zilog, Inc. 2004 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and outstanding stock options originally granted by IXYS Corporation under the Zilog Plan that were held by continuing employees of Zilog. At the time of the acquisition of IXYS Corporation, these awards were converted to Littelfuse stock options, with adjustments made to the exercise price of the stock options and the number of shares subject to stock options as agreed upon in the Acquisition Agreement. These options vested in accordance with their original terms, generally in equal annual installments over a four-year period from the original grant date. The options generally expire ten years from the date of grant. The Zilog 2004 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan expired in February 2014 and no additional grants have been made thereunder. Therefore,
