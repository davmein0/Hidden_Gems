MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
 AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.
Principal Market
Our Class A ordinary shares are listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “KNSA.”
Holders
As of February 21, 2025, there were four holders of record of our Class A ordinary shares, one holder of record of our Class B ordinary shares, one holder of record of our Class A1 ordinary shares and one holder of record of our Class B1 ordinary shares. The actual number of shareholders is greater than this number of record holders, and includes shareholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees. The number of holders of record also does not include shareholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities.
Dividends Policy
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares. We intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare and pay dividends to holders of our ordinary shares will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, which may take into account several factors, including general economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the implications of the payment of dividends by us to our shareholders and any other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, pursuant to the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006 a company may not declare or pay dividends unless (1) it has profits available to make the distribution and (2) the distribution must be justified by reference to relevant accounts. Under our articles of association, each of our ordinary shares is entitled to dividends if, as and when dividends are declared by our board of directors, subject to any preferred dividend right of the holders of any preferred shares.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the risks identified in Part I-Item 1A “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report and our other filings with the SEC, our actual results could differ materially from the results, performance or achievements expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing novel therapies for diseases with unmet need, with a focus on cardiovascular indications. Our portfolio of assets is based on strong biologic rationale or validated mechanisms and offers the potential for differentiation. 
ARCALYST is an IL-1α and IL-1β cytokine trap. In 2017, we licensed ARCALYST from Regeneron, which discovered and initially developed the drug. Our exclusive license to ARCALYST from Regeneron includes worldwide rights, excluding the Middle East and North Africa, for all applications other than those in oncology and local administration to the eye or ear. We received FDA approval of ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis and reduction in risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years and older in March 2021. Recurrent pericarditis is a painful inflammatory cardiovascular disease with an estimated United States prevalent population of approximately 40,000 patients seeking and receiving medical treatment. ARCALYST is also approved in the United States for the treatment of CAPS, including FCAS and Muckle-Wells Syndrome in adults and children 12 years and older, and the maintenance of remission in DIRA in adults and children weighing 10 kg or more. ARCALYST is commercially available across the United States through a select network of specialty pharmacies. We are responsible for sales and distribution of ARCALYST in all approved indications in the United States, and evenly split profits on sales as well as third party proceeds with Regeneron. In 2022, we granted Huadong exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ARCALYST in the Huadong Territory. In 2023, Regeneron initiated a technology transfer of the manufacturing process for ARCALYST drug substance, and we are working to qualify Samsung as our replacement CDMO.
KPL-387 is an investigational, fully human immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody that binds IL1-R1, inhibiting IL-1α and IL-1β mediated signaling. KPL-387 is an independently developed asset that we believe 
has the potential to 
further advance recurrent pericarditis treatment options for patients by providing the added convenience of monthly subcutaneous dosing with a liquid formulation. In June 2024, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of KPL-387 in normal healthy volunteers. In February 2025, we announced our plan to initiate a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of KPL-387 in recurrent pericarditis in mid-2025. We expect data from the Phase 2 portion of the trial in the second half of 2026.
KPL-1161 is an independently developed, pre-clinical, Fc-modified immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody that binds IL-1R1, inhibiting IL-1α- and IL-1β-mediated signaling. KPL-1161 is a modified version of KPL-387 designed to have an increased drug half-life that we believe could support quarterly subcutaneous dosing.
Abiprubart is an investigational monoclonal antibody inhibitor of CD40-CD154 costimulatory interaction, which we believe to be an attractive approach to address multiple autoimmune disease pathologies. We hold an exclusive worldwide license to abiprubart from 
BIDMC. We previously announced a Phase 2b clinical trial of abiprubart in Sjögren’s Disease. In February 2025, we announced our plans to discontinue development of abiprubart in the indication and explore strategic alternatives for the asset. 
Mavrilimumab is an investigational monoclonal antibody inhibitor targeting GM-CSFRα. In 2017, we licensed exclusive worldwide rights in all indications to mavrilimumab from MedImmune. In February 2025, we announced our termination of our license agreement from MedImmune for convenience, effective in May 2025. In addition, in February 2025, we provided written notice to Huadong that Huadong has not conducted material development activity with respect to mavrilimumab in the People’s Republic of China for a continuous period in excess of six months as required under the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement. Unless Huadong conducts material development activity within 60 days of the notice, the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement will terminate in April 2025.

Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to sustain our organization will depend heavily on a number of factors, including the continued commercialization of ARCALYST, the development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates, if approved, and the management of our costs consistent with our current operating plan. 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, our net loss was $43.2 million, as compared to net income of
 $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $521.1 million compared to an accumulated deficit of $478.0 million as of December 31, 2023. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $243.6 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. See 
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results Of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources
.” 
Components
 of Our Results of Operations
Product revenue, net 
We have been generating product revenue from sales of ARCALYST since April 2021. ARCALYST is sold through a third party logistics provider that distributes primarily through a select network of specialty pharmacies (collectively, “customers”), which deliver the medication to patients by mail. 
​
Net revenue from product sales is recognized at the transaction price when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon shipment of the product from the third party logistics provider. 
​
Our net revenues represent total revenues adjusted for discounts and allowances, including estimated cash discounts, chargebacks, rebates, returns, copay assistance, and specialty pharmacy and distributor fees. These adjustments represent variable consideration under ASC 606 and are estimated using the expected value method and are recorded when revenue is recognized on the sale of the product. These adjustments are established by management as its best estimate based on available information and will be adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such allowances. Adjustments for variable consideration are determined based on the contractual terms with customers, historical trends, communications with customers and the levels of inventory remaining in the distribution channel, as well as expectations about the market for the product and anticipated introduction of competitive products.
​
License and collaboration revenue
​
License and collaboration revenue includes amounts recognized related to upfront payments, royalty revenue, milestone payments and products sold under collaboration agreements. 
​
In February 2022, we entered into the Huadong Collaboration Agreements, pursuant to which we granted Huadong exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the Huadong Licensed Products in the Huadong Territory. In February 2025, we provided written notice to Huadong that Huadong has not conducted material development activity with respect to mavrilimumab in the People’s Republic of China for a continuous period in excess of six months as required under the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement. Unless Huadong conducts material development activity within 60 days of the notice, the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement will terminate on April 25, 2025. We otherwise retain our current rights to the Huadong Licensed Products outside the Huadong Territory. For more information, see “
Business –License and Acquisition Agreements—Out-Licensing Agreements—Huadong Collaboration Agreements
”.
​
Under the Huadong Collaboration Agreements, we received a total upfront cash payment of $22.0 million, which includes $12.0 million for the Huadong Territory license of ARCALYST and $10.0 million for the Huadong Territory license of mavrilimumab. In the fourth quarter of 2024, following the achievement of a regulatory milestone under the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement, Huadong became obligated to make an additional cash payment of $20.0 million, which was received in the first quarter of 2025. In addition, we will be eligible to receive additional contingent sales-based milestones payments related to ARCALYST. Huadong will also be obligated to pay us tiered percentage royalties on ARCALYST ranging from the low-to-mid teens on annual net sales in the Huadong 
104

Table of Contents
Territory, subject to certain reductions tied to ARCALYST manufacturing costs and certain other customary reductions, with an aggregate minimum floor. Royalties will be payable on a country-by-country or region-by-region basis until the later of (i) 12 years after the first commercial sale of ARCALYST in such country or region in the Huadong Territory, (ii) the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim of our patent rights or any joint collaboration patent rights that covers ARCALYST in such country or region in the Huadong Territory, and (iii) the expiration of the last regulatory exclusivity for ARCALYST in such country or region in the Huadong Territory. We recognized the $10.0 million related to the mavrilimumab license during the year ended December 31, 2022 and do not expect to recognize any additional license and collaboration revenue following the termination of the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement. We have recognized $0.2 million of revenue of the $32.0 million transaction price under the ARCALYST license agreement as of December 31, 2024, and will recognize the remaining revenue as materials are shipped. 
In August 2022, we entered into the Genentech License Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Genentech exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize the Genentech Licensed Products. For more information, see “
Business –License and Acquisition Agreements—Out-Licensing Agreements—Genentech License Agreement
”.
Under the Genentech License Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $80.0 million for the license. Additionally, in 2023, we received a total of $35.0 million in additional payments from Genentech related to delivery of certain drug material to Genentech and Genentech’s achievement of a development milestone. In the fourth quarter of 2023, following the achievement of a development milestone related to a second indication under the Genentech License Agreement, Genentech became obligated to make an additional cash payment of $10.0 million, which was received in the first quarter of 2024. In the second quarter of 2024, we received $5.0 million following the achievement of a development milestone related to a third indication under the Genentech License Agreement. We will be eligible to receive up to a total of approximately $600.0 million in contingent payments, including specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, of which approximately $570.0 million remains as of December 31, 2024. We will also be eligible to receive tiered percentage royalties on a Genentech Licensed Product-by-Genentech Licensed Product basis ranging from low-double digits to mid-teens on annual net sales of each Genentech Licensed Product, subject to certain customary reductions, with an aggregate minimum floor, before fulfilling our upstream financial obligations. Royalties will be payable on a Genentech Licensed Product-by-Genentech Licensed Product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of the expiration of certain patents that cover a Genentech Licensed Product, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such Genentech Licensed Product, or the tenth anniversary of first commercial sale of such Genentech Licensed Product in such country. As of December 31, 2024, we have recognized the $130.0 million received from Genentech under the Genentech License Agreement as revenue.
​
Operating Expenses
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold includes production and distribution costs of ARCALYST, amortization of the $20.0 million payment we made to Regeneron in the first quarter of 2021 upon achievement of a regulatory milestone and other miscellaneous product costs associated with ARCALYST. Cost of goods sold also includes labor and overhead costs associated with the production of ARCALYST associated with supply chain, quality, and regulatory activities, and the technology transfer of the manufacturing process for the ARCALYST drug substance. 
Collaboration expenses
Collaboration expenses consist of Regeneron’s share of the profit related to ARCALYST sales under the Regeneron Agreement and the cost of products sold under collaboration agreements. We evenly split profits on sales of ARCALYST with Regeneron, where profits are determined after deducting from net sales of ARCALYST certain costs related to the manufacturing and commercialization of ARCALYST. Such costs include but are not limited to (i) our cost of goods sold for product used, sold or otherwise distributed for patient use by us; (ii) customary commercialization expenses, including the cost of our field force, and (iii) our cost to market, advertise and otherwise promote ARCALYST, with such costs identified in subsection (iii) subject to specified limits. With respect to the technology transfer of ARCALYST drug substance manufacturing initiated by Regeneron in March 2023, to the extent permitted by the Regeneron Agreement, the fully-burdened costs of each of us and Regeneron incurred in performing such technology 
105

Table of Contents
transfer shall also be deducted from net sales of ARCALYST to determine profit. We also evenly split with Regeneron any proceeds received by us from any licensees, sublicensees and distributors in consideration for the sale, license or other disposition of rights with respect to ARCALYST, including upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the research and development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses may include:
●
expenses incurred to conduct the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval;
●
expenses incurred under agreements with CROs that are primarily engaged in the oversight and conduct of our clinical trials and CDMOs that are primarily engaged to provide preclinical and clinical drug substance and product for our research and development programs for our product candidates;
●
other costs related to acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials, including manufacturing validation batches, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other scientific development services;
●
payments made in cash or equity securities under third party licensing, acquisition and other similar agreements;
●
employee-related expenses, including salaries and benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;
●
costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and
●
allocated facilities-related costs, which include rent and utilities, depreciation and other expenses.
We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service providers. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered.
Our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis for our product candidates and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to outside consultants, CROs, CDMOs and research laboratories in connection with our preclinical development, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. Our direct research and development expenses by program also include fees incurred under license, acquisition and other similar agreements. We do not allocate employee costs or facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific programs because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources primarily to conduct our research and discovery activities as well as for managing our preclinical and clinical development, process development and manufacturing clinical and preclinical materials.
Research and development activities are central to our business. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. As a result, we expect that our research and development 
106

Table of Contents
expenses will be substantial over the next several years as we conduct our ongoing and/or planned clinical trials for our product candidates, as well as conduct other preclinical and clinical development, and make regulatory filings for our product candidates. 
At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the clinical development of our current or future product candidates or when, if ever, we will realize revenue from the sale of our current or future product candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, including share based compensation expense for personnel in selling, marketing, medical, executive, business development, finance, human resources, legal and support personnel functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include external commercialization, marketing, and professional fees for legal, patent, and accounting services.
We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future as we continue to expand our infrastructure related to the commercialization of ARCALYST and our other product candidates, if approved.
Other Income
Other income consists of interest income recognized from investments in money market funds, United States Treasury notes and other miscellaneous income offset by expenses related to investments.
Income Taxes
Prior to the Redomiciliation, our principal holding company was incorporated and principally subject to taxation in Bermuda. Following the Redomiciliation, our principal holding company is incorporated and principally subject to taxation in the United Kingdom. Under the current laws of Bermuda, there is no corporate income tax levied on an exempted company’s income, resulting in an effective zero percent tax rate. As a result, we have not recorded any income tax benefits from our losses incurred in Bermuda during each reporting periods in which it was incorporated there, and no net operating loss carryforwards are currently available to us for those losses. Following the Redomiciliation, our income is subject to the enacted United Kingdom statutory corporate tax rate and net operating losses incurred have an indefinite carryforward. Our wholly owned United States subsidiaries, Kiniksa US, and Primatope Therapeutics, Inc. are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. Our wholly owned subsidiary Kiniksa UK, its Swiss branch office, and Kiniksa UK’s wholly owned subsidiaries, Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (Germany) GmbH, Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (France) SARL, and Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, GmbH (“Kiniksa Switzerland”) are subject to taxation in their respective countries.
​
In the first quarter of 2022, Kiniksa Bermuda transferred exclusive rights to develop and commercialize mavrilimumab in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, to Kiniksa UK. In the third quarter of 2022, Kiniksa Bermuda transferred exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize vixarelimab to Kiniksa UK. In the fourth quarter of 2023, all rights, title and interest in, among other things, certain contracts, intellectual property rights, product filings and approvals and other information, plans and inventory owned insofar as they related exclusively or primarily to ARCALYST were allocated by Kiniksa UK to its Swiss branch office. 
In the first quarter of 2024, Kiniksa Bermuda transferred to Kiniksa Switzerland all rights, title and interest in, among other things, certain contracts, intellectual property rights, product filings and approvals and other information, plans and materials owned insofar as they related exclusively or primarily to abiprubart, mavrilimumab, KPL-387, KPL-1161 and other preclinical assets, with such exceptions as necessary to allow the completion of Cohort 4 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of abiprubart in rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”).
 In connection with each of the foregoing transfers and /or allocations, we recognized a step-up in basis and did not incur any material tax liabilities. 

​
107

Table of Contents
In the second quarter of 2024, Kiniksa UK terminated its exclusive rights to develop and commercialize mavrilimumab in the Huadong Territory, with such rights reverting to Kiniksa Switzerland. Thereafter, Kiniksa Switzerland held worldwide rights to develop and commercialize mavrilimumab. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Kiniksa UK contributed all of its rights, title and interest in, among other things, certain contracts, intellectual property rights, product filings and approvals and other information, plans and materials owned or controlled by Kiniksa UK insofar as they related exclusively or primarily to vixarelimab to Kiniksa Switzerland. In connection with the termination of Kiniksa UK rights and the contribution, we revalued the assets at fair market value and did not incur any material tax liabilities.

Product Revenue, Net
We recognized net revenue from the sale of ARCALYST of $417.0 million, $233.2 million and $122.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increases in 2024 and 2023 were primarily driven by an increase in patient enrollment. 
​
License and Collaboration Revenue 
​
We reported $6.2 million of license and collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024
, primarily driven by the achievement of a $5.0 million development milestone related to a third indication under the Genentech License Agreement, $0.7 million of products sold under the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreements, and $0.2 million of deferred revenue recognized related to the delivery of such materials. 
We reported $37.1 million of license 
108

Table of Contents
and collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, related to the Genentech License Agreement primarily driven by the achievement of $25.0 million in development milestones related to two new indications, materials delivered and our ongoing recognition of the transaction price related to the in-progress Phase 2b clinical trial of vixarelimab in prurigo nodularis. We reported $97.7 million of license and collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, which primarily consisted of $87.7 million for revenue related to the Genentech License Agreement and $10.0 million in revenue recognized upon the signing of the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement in February of 2022. We expect to recognize $31.8 million of deferred revenue related to the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement over the life of the agreement as materials are delivered.
​
Cost of Goods Sold
We recognized cost of goods sold of $60.9 million, $33.4 million, and $22.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase of $27.5 million in 2024 from 2023 related primarily to the increase in sales of ARCALYST and a $12.6 million increase related to the technology transfer of the manufacturing process offset by a decrease in average cost per unit resulting from favorable production variances. The increase of $10.5 million in 2023 from 2022
 related primarily to the increase in sales of ARCALYST and $3.3 million related to the initiation of the technology transfer of the manufacturing process offset by a decrease in average cost per unit resulting from favorable production variances.
​
Collaboration Expenses 
We recognized collaboration expenses of $128.3 million, $56.5 million and $24.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase of $71.8 million in 2024 from 2023 relates primarily to increased revenue from sales of ARCALYST driving higher profits under the Regeneron agreement and to a $10.0 million payment due to Regeneron related to a regulatory milestone achieved under the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement. The increase of $32.5 million in 2023 from 2022 relates primarily to an increase in revenue from the sales of ARCALYST and improved profitability under the Regeneron agreement.

Other Income
Other income was $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024,

compared to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.
 The increase of $1.0 million was primarily due to interest earned on higher cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances.
 Other income was $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to other income of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due primarily to higher interest rates on U.S. Treasury notes and a higher average balance in short term investments. 
Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded an income tax provision of $7.0 million relating primarily to income earned in Switzerland and the U.S., net of Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) deduction and U.S. federal and state R&D Credits utilized.
​
For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded an income tax benefit of $30.7 million relating to a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $33.8 million primarily associated with Kiniksa UK’s allocation of its ARCALYST assets to its Swiss branch office and the release of the valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets offset by the establishment of a partial valuation allowance on our UK deferred tax assets. The net benefit in the net deferred tax asset was offset by current income tax expense of $3.1 million primarily associated with income earned in the UK and the United States.

​
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded an income tax benefit of $172.3 million relating to a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $185.5 million primarily associated with the release of the valuation allowance on our UK deferred tax assets. Our UK deferred tax asset consists primarily of the tax basis of the intangible assets that were transferred to our wholly-owned UK subsidiary in 2021 and 2022.

​
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, our principal source of liquidity was cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which totaled $243.6 million. Our net income (losses) were ($43.2) million, $14.1 million and $183.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
We expect our cash balance and our expected cash inflows from operations to allow us to meet our current operating plan.
Under various agreements with third parties, we have agreed to make milestone payments, pay royalties, pay annual maintenance fees and to meet due diligence requirements, each based upon specified events. Pursuant to the Regeneron Agreement, we have entered into a supply agreement with Regeneron to purchase both clinical and commercial product. We have committed to minimum payments to Regeneron of $40.7 million, all of which are due within one year. We have entered into lease agreements for office and laboratory space, and vehicles, with total future lease payments of $11.3 million, $2.7 million of which are due within one year. In connection with our ongoing technology transfer of ARCALYST drug substance manufacturing, we have entered into a manufacturing commitment with Samsung to establish a new manufacturing site for ARCALYST drug substance. Such commitment, which includes the purchase of raw materials and related service fees, obligates us to minimum payments of $151.0 million, $15.2 million of which are due within one year. We have additionally entered into agreements with several CDMOs to provide us with preclinical and clinical trial materials for our non-ARCALYST assets, which obligate us to minimum payments of $40.8 million, $39.0 million of which are due within one year. In February 2025 we issued termination notices to several of these CDMOs to terminate clinical supply agreements for the production of abiprubart. The terminations will be effective in March 2025, and we are currently performing an analysis of the financial impact of the terminations. As of the date of this report, we expect to pay between $14.0 million and $17.0 million in termination cost.
​
Under various agreements with third parties, we are entitled to receive upfront payments, milestone payments, and royalties, each based upon specified milestones. During the year ended December 31, 2024 we received $10.0 million, following Genentech’s achievement of a development milestone in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to a second indication under the Genentech License Agreement and $5.0 million following Genentech’s achievement of a development milestone related to a third indication under the Genentech License Agreement. In the fourth quarter of

Funding Requirements
We expect to incur significant expenses in connection with our ongoing and planned activities as we continue to commercialize ARCALYST and advance our current and future product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval and commercialize one or more of our current or future product candidates, if approved. We may also incur expenses in connection with the in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates. As a result, we expect to incur additional expenses related to milestone, royalty and other payments payable 
112

Table of Contents
to third parties with whom we have entered into license, acquisition and other similar agreements to acquire the rights to our product candidates. We expect to incur expenses as we:
●
support our sales, marketing and distribution 
capabilities, infrastructure and organization 
to commercialize ARCALYST and any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;
●
conduct new and ongoing research and pre-clinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including our planned Phase 2/3 clinical trial of KPL-387 in recurrent pericarditis, our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of KPL-387 in normal healthy volunteers and our pre-clinical investigations of KPL-1161;
●
manufacture our products and product candidates for clinical or commercial use, increase our manufacturing capabilities, add additional manufacturers or suppliers and perform activities related to our technology transfer of the process for manufacturing ARCALYST drug substance; 
●
seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;
●
identify, assess and study new or expanded indications for our products and product candidates and/or new or alternative dosing levels, dosing frequencies or administrations of our products and product candidates;
●
make milestone or other payments under any current or future license, acquisition, collaboration or other strategic transaction agreement; 
●
seek to identify, assess and study new or expanded indications for our products or product candidates, new or alternative dosing levels and frequency for our products or product candidates, or new or alternative administration of our products or product candidates, including method, mode or delivery device;
●
seek to identify, assess, acquire or develop additional product candidates;
●
address litigation arising out of, but not limited to, product liability claims, intellectual property disputes, disputes arising from our collaboration and license agreements and employment-related disputes;
●
enter into licensing, acquisition, collaboration or other strategic transaction agreements; 
●
seek to maintain, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio;
●
seek to attract and retain skilled personnel;
●
create additional infrastructure to support our product development and commercialization efforts; and
●
experience delays or encounter issues with any of the above, including but not limited to failed trials, complex results, safety issues, regulatory challenges that require longer follow-up of existing trials, additional major trials, additional supportive trials in order to pursue marketing approval, a pandemic or other outbreak of disease or disruptions to the national or global economy. 
We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. The future viability of our company is dependent on our ability to fund our operations through sales of ARCALYST and/or raise additional capital, such as through debt or equity offerings, as needed. We anticipate that we may require additional capital if we choose to pursue in-licenses or acquisitions of other product candidates and technologies or their related businesses. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to product manufacturing, including technology transfer costs, sales, marketing and distribution of ARCALYST. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our current or future product candidates, pursue additional indications or additional territories for our products or any of our current or future 
113

Table of Contents
product candidates, we expect to incur significant expenses related to product development and manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, depending on where we choose to commercialize.
Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of biologic products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements may be impacted by a number of factors, including those described in Part I, Item 1A. “
Risk Factors
” in this Annual Report.
Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial and sustained product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, or other sources, including, licensing, collaboration, marketing, distribution or other strategic transactions or arrangements with third parties. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our shareholders’ ownership interest may be materially diluted, and the terms of such securities could include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our shareholders’ rights as an ordinary shareholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specified actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. In addition, debt financing would result in fixed payment obligations.
If we raise funds through licensing, collaboration, marketing, distribution or other strategic transactions or arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, product candidates or future revenue streams, or otherwise agree to terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to obtain funding, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs for product candidates, product portfolio expansion or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business prospects, or we may be unable to continue operations.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
​
Revenue Recognition
​
ASC 606 outlines a five-step process for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue associated with the performance obligations as they are satisfied.
We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, we determine the performance obligations that are distinct. We recognize as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, our performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon receipt of the product by the customer.
114

Table of Contents
ASC 606 requires entities to record a contract asset when a performance obligation has been satisfied or partially satisfied, but the amount of consideration has not yet been received because the receipt of the consideration is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. ASC 606 also requires an entity to present a revenue contract as a contract liability in instances when a customer pays consideration, or an entity has a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (e.g. receivable), before the entity transfers a good or service to the customer.
Product Revenue, Net
Net revenue from product sales is recognized at the transaction price when the specialty pharmacy or specialty distributors obtains control of our products, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon shipment of the product from the third party logistics provider. 
​
Our net revenues represent total revenues adjusted for discounts and allowances, including estimated cash discounts, chargebacks, rebates, returns, copay assistance, and specialty pharmacy and distributor fees. These adjustments represent variable consideration under ASC 606 and are estimated using the expected value method and are recorded when revenue is recognized on the sale of the product. These adjustments are established by us as our best estimate based on available information and will be adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such allowances. Adjustments for variable consideration are determined based on the contractual terms with customers, historical trends, communications with customers and the levels of inventory remaining in the distribution channel, as well as expectations about the market for the product and anticipated introduction of competitive products.
​
As of December 31, 2024, a 10% change in our product revenue allowance and reserve would not result in a material change in our net revenue.
​
Accrued Research and Development Expenses
As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advanced payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:
●
vendors, including research laboratories, in connection with preclinical development activities;
●
CROs and investigative sites in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials; 
●
third parties in the connection with the achievement of milestones due under license acquisition and other similar agreements; and
●
CDMOs in connection with drug substance and drug product formulation and manufacturing of materials.
We base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of participants and the completion of clinical trial milestones. Non-refundable prepayments determined to be used within one year for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. 
115

Table of Contents
Non-refundable prepayments or minimum balance requirements associated to clinical trials determined to not be used within one year are classified as other long-term assets. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses.
As of December 31, 2024, we have accrued $11 million of estimated research and development expenses. 
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or in our tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the benefit (provision) for income taxes. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe, based upon the weighting of both positive and negative evidence available, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits expected, cumulative recent earnings and considering prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Significant judgment is required in assessing both positive and negative evidence available and, to the extent that a reversal of any portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is deemed appropriate, a tax benefit will be recorded in our income tax benefit (provision) in the period of such reversal.
We believe our estimates for the valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets recognized in our financial statements are appropriate based upon our assessment of the factors mentioned above. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of money market funds and United States Treasury notes. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of United States interest rates. Such interest rates have and in the future may be subject to significant volatility. However, because of the short-term nature of the instruments in our portfolio, an immediate 100 basis point change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of our investment portfolio or on our financial position or results of operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals International, plc
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals International, plc and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Table of Contents
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Accrued Research and Development Costs
As described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into various research and development-related contracts with companies both inside and outside of the United States. When billing terms under these contracts do not coincide with the timing of when the work is performed, management is required to make estimates of outstanding obligations to those third parties as of the end of the reporting period. Within accrued expenses, total accrued research and development expenses amounted to $11.0 million as of December 31, 2024, which include accruals for these estimated research and development obligations. Accrual estimates are based on a number of factors, including management’s assessment of progress towards completion of the research and development activities, invoicing to date under the contracts, communication from the research institution or other companies of any actual costs incurred during the period that have not yet been invoiced, and the costs included in the contracts. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accrued research and development costs is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in estimating the accrued research and development costs and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence for these accrued costs and the factors related to management’s assessment of progress towards completion of the research and development activities, invoicing to date under the contracts and communication from the research institution or other companies of any actual costs incurred during the period that have not yet been invoiced.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to accrued research and development costs, including controls over the review of contracts, accumulating information on actual costs incurred during the period, and assessment of progress towards completion of the research and development activities. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for estimating accrued research and development costs; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology used by management to determine the estimate; (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the factors related to management’s assessment of progress towards completion of the research and development activities, invoicing to date under the contracts and communication from the research institution or other companies of any actual costs incurred during the period that have not yet been invoiced by testing, on a sample basis, specific tasks and the associated cost incurred for services the Company has not yet been invoiced for or otherwise notified of the actual cost at period end, and (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the data inputs to the estimate, including total costs included within executed contracts and actual billed expenses under these contracts.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
​
1.           Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation
Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals International, plc (the “Company” or “Kiniksa International”) is a biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing novel therapies for diseases with unmet need, with a focus on cardiovascular indications. The Company’s portfolio of immune-modulating assets is based on strong biologic rationale or validated mechanisms, targets a spectrum of underserved cardiovascular and autoimmune conditions and offers the potential for differentiation.
The Company is the successor issuer to Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (“Kiniksa Bermuda”). On June 27, 2024, the Company and Kiniksa Bermuda completed a transaction pursuant to a Bermuda court-approved scheme of arrangement (the “Scheme”), which had been previously approved by Kiniksa Bermuda’s shareholders. Pursuant to the Scheme, the shareholders of Kiniksa Bermuda became the shareholders of the Company and the Company became the ultimate parent and holding company of the Kiniksa organization, thereby effecting a change of incorporation from Bermuda to the United Kingdom (the “Redomiciliation”). As used herein, and unless the context otherwise requires, references to the “Company” prior to the Redomiciliation shall refer to Kiniksa Bermuda and from and after the Redomiciliation, to Kiniksa International. In addition, references to “ordinary shares” prior to the Redomiciliation are to Kiniksa Bermuda’s common shares and from and after the Redomiciliation are to Kiniksa International’s ordinary shares.
The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the biopharmaceuticals industry including, but not limited to, commercialization of existing and new products, conducting clinical research and development, its current and future products and product candidates, risks from existing or new competition, protection of proprietary intellectual and other technology and compliance with US and foreign regulations and approval requirements.
Principles of Consolidation
The Redomiciliation was accounted for as a change in the reporting entity between entities under common control and the historical basis of accounting was retained as if the entities had always been combined for financial reporting purposes. The consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the Redomiciliation are the consolidated statements of Kiniksa Bermuda as the predecessor to the Company for accounting and reporting purposes and, upon completion of the Redomiciliation, such historical consolidated financial statements became Kiniksa International’s historical consolidated financial statements.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“Kiniksa US”), Kiniksa Bermuda and Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (UK), Ltd. (“Kiniksa UK”) as well as the subsidiary of Kiniksa US, Primatope Therapeutics, Inc. (“Primatope”) and subsidiaries of Kiniksa UK, Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (Germany) GmbH (“Kiniksa Germany”), Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (France) SARL (“Kiniksa France”), and Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals, GmbH (“Kiniksa Switzerland”), after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. Where the Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals International, plc entity is referred to in its single, unconsolidated form, it is referred to as “Kiniksa International”.

​
Reclassifications 
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations and comprehensive loss or cash flows. A reclassification has been made to the Consolidated Balance Sheet for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, to reclassify the collaboration accrued expenses to be a separate line item.

(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
​
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the recognition of revenue, the accrual for research and development expenses, and the valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets. Estimates are periodically reviewed in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reporting and Functional Currency
The financial results of the Company’s global activities are reported in U.S. dollars (“USD”) and its foreign subsidiaries other than Kiniksa UK and Kiniksa Switzerland generally utilize their respective local currency to be their functional currency.
Transactions in other currencies are recorded in the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing when the transactions occur. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are re-measured into the functional currency at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate gains and losses arising from re-measurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in income or losses in the period in which they occur.
For the Company’s foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies are translated into USD at end-of-period exchange rates and the resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders’ equity.
Liquidity
The Company has evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $
521,143
. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a net loss of $
43,193
 and provided $
25,689
 of cash from operating activities. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $
243,627
. 
Based on its current operating plan, the Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditure requirements for at least twelve months from the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements. The future viability of the Company beyond that point is dependent on its ability to fund its operations through sales of ARCALYST and/or raise additional capital, as needed. If the Company is unable to grow or sustain ARCALYST commercial revenue in future periods, the Company would need to seek additional financing through public or private securities offerings, debt financings, or other sources, which may include licensing, collaborations or other strategic transactions or arrangements. Although the Company has been successful in raising capital in the past, there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its commercialization efforts, research and development programs for product candidates or product portfolio expansion, which could adversely affect its business prospects, or the Company may be unable to continue operations.

2.           Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company classifies deposits in banks, money market funds and cash invested temporarily in various instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023 cash and cash equivalents consisted principally of U.S. Treasury notes, amounts held in money market accounts and cash on deposit at commercial banks.
Short-Term Investments
The Company generally invests its excess cash in money market funds and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury notes. Such investments which are included in short-term investments on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets are considered available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity, net of related tax effects. Realized gains and losses, if any, on short-term investments are included in interest income.
If the AFS debt security’s fair value declines below its amortized cost the Company considers all available evidence to evaluate the extent to which the decline is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. If the decline is due to noncredit-related factors then no credit loss is recorded and the unrealized loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity, net of the related tax effects. If the decline is considered to be a credit-related impairment, it is recognized as an allowance on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding charge to the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The credit allowance is limited to the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost basis. No credit-related allowances or impairments have been recognized on the Company’s investments in available-for-sale debt securities. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, substantially all of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held at 
two
 financial institutions. The Company generally maintains balances in various operating accounts at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality, in amounts that may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses related to its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships.
The Company is also subject to credit risk from the accounts receivable related to product revenue. The majority of trade accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for cash discounts associated with prompt payments from customers. All trade accounts receivable arise from product revenue in the United States due from the Company’s third party logistics provider. There were no material write-offs charged against the allowance for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Fair Value Measurements
Certain assets and liabilities of the Company are carried at fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the 
F-11

Table of Contents
KINIKSA PHARMACEUTICALS, LTD.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
​
following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:
●
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
●
Level 2—Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices), such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
●
Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.
The Company’s cash equivalents and short-term investments, consisting of money market accounts and U.S. Treasury notes, are carried at fair value, determined based on Level 1 and 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy described above (see Note 3). The carrying values of the Company’s prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
Leases
At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a “lease” as defined by ASC 842. A lease is an arrangement, or part of an arrangement, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company determines if the arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time. It assesses throughout the period of use whether the Company has both of the following (1) the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset and (2) the right to direct the use of the identified asset. This determination is reassessed if the terms of the arrangement are changed. Leases are classified as operating or finance leases based on the terms of the lease agreement and certain characteristics of the identified asset. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement date based on the present value of the minimum future lease payments.
Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as ROU assets with corresponding lease liabilities and, if applicable, long-term lease liabilities. The Company has elected not to recognize leases with a term of one year or less on its balance sheet, the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating leases, ROU assets and their corresponding lease liabilities are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. However, certain adjustments to the ROU assets may be required for items such as incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease arrangements is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. 
In accordance with the guidance in ASU 2016-02, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components (e.g., land, building, etc.), non-lease components (e.g., common area maintenance, consumables, etc.), and non-components (e.g., property taxes, insurance, etc.); then the fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any related to non-components) must be allocated based on fair values to the lease components and non-lease components.
The Company has elected to account for the lease and non-lease components of each of its operating leases as a single lease component and allocate all of the arrangement consideration to the lease component only. The lease

​
component results in an operating ROU asset being recorded on the balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis as lease expense.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of these assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gains or losses are included in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the period of disposal. The expected useful lives of the respective assets are as follows:
​
​
​
​
​
​
Estimated Useful Life
Computer hardware and software
​
3
 - 
5 years
Laboratory equipment
​
5 years
Furniture, fixtures and vehicles
​
5
 - 
7 years
Leasehold improvements
​
Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term
​
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value with cost based on the first-in first-out method. The Company classifies inventory as long-term when the inventory is expected to be utilized beyond the Company’s normal operating cycle and includes such amounts in other long-term assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Prior to the regulatory approval of its drug candidates, the Company incurs expenses for the manufacture of product candidate supplies to support clinical development that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of those therapeutics. Until the date at which regulatory approval has been received or is otherwise considered probable, the Company records all such costs as research and development expenses. The Company performs an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventories during each reporting period and writes down any excess and obsolete inventory to its net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified. Such impairment charges, should they occur, are recorded as a component of cost of sales in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires the use of estimates by management. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional writedown of inventory may be required.
​
Finished goods that can be used in either the production of clinical or commercial products is expensed as research and development costs when identified and labeled for use in clinical trials as the products are required to be re-labeled for alternative uses. The finished goods inventory that will ultimately be distributed free of charge under the Company’s patient assistance program are recognized as selling expense when they are labeled as free goods.
​
The Company is conducting a technology transfer of ARCALYST drug substance manufacturing from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Regeneron”) to Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”). Costs associated with the establishment of ARCALYST production at a new manufacturing site that do not meet the criteria for research and development or capitalization into inventory, including raw materials consumed, are included in cost of goods sold in the period incurred.
 During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 the Company incurred $
15,849
 and $
3,265
, respectively, of expense related to the technology transfer of ARCALYST drug substance manufacturing in cost of goods sold. 
No
 expenses were incurred in the year ending December 31, 2022.

​
Revenue Recognition
​
ASC 606 outlines a five-step process for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue associated with the performance obligations as they are satisfied.
​
The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company determines the performance obligations that are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied. Generally, the Company’s performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery of the product to the customer.
​
ASC 606 requires entities to record a contract asset when a performance obligation has been satisfied or partially satisfied, but the amount of consideration has not yet been received because the receipt of the consideration is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. ASC 606 also requires an entity to present a revenue contract as a contract liability in instances when a customer pays consideration, or an entity has a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (e.g. receivable), before the entity transfers a good or service to the customer. 
​
Product Revenue, Net
Following the FDA approval of ARCALYST in March 2021, the Company began generating product revenue from sales of ARCALYST in April 2021. ARCALYST is sold through a third party logistics provider that distributes primarily through a network of authorized specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors (“customer”), which deliver the medication to patients by mail. The Company’s payment terms are between 30 to 35 days. 
​
Net revenue from product sales is recognized at the transaction price when the specialty pharmacy or specialty distributors obtains control of the Company’s products, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon shipment of the product from the third party logistics provider. 
​
The Company’s net revenues represent total revenues adjusted for discounts and allowances, including estimated cash discounts, chargebacks, rebates, returns, copay assistance, and specialty pharmacy and distributor fees. These adjustments represent variable consideration under ASC 606 and are estimated using the expected value method and are recorded when revenue is recognized on the sale of the product. These adjustments are established by management as its best estimate based on available information and will be adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such allowances. Adjustments for variable consideration are determined based on the contractual terms with customers, historical trends, communications with customers and the levels of inventory remaining in the distribution channel, as well as expectations about the market for the product and anticipated introduction of competitive products.
​
Discounts and Allowances
​
Revenue from product sales is recorded at the transaction price, which includes estimates for discounts and allowances and includes cash discounts, chargebacks, rebates, returns, copay assistance, and specialty pharmacy and distributor fees. These reserves are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the Customer and right of offset exists) or a current liability (if the right of offset does not exist, the amount is payable to a third party, or is related to a future return). These allowances are established by management as its best estimate based on historical experience and data points available and are adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves. Allowances for customer credits, chargebacks, rebates, data fees for services, returns, and discounts are

established based on contractual terms with customers and analyses of historical usage of these items. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company’s estimates. If actual results in the future vary from the Company’s estimates, the Company will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. The nature of the allowances and accruals requiring estimates, and the specific considerations the Company uses in estimating these amounts are as follows:
​
Government Chargebacks and Rebates
​
Government and other rebates and chargebacks include amounts payable to payors and healthcare professionals under various programs and by payor and individual payor plans. Rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which may vary by product, payor and individual payor plans. For qualified programs that can purchase products through wholesalers or other distributors at a lower contractual price, the wholesalers or distributors charge back to the Company the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price.
​
Rebates and chargebacks are estimated primarily based on product sales, and expected payor mix and discount rates, which require significant estimates and judgment. Additionally, in developing the estimates the Company considers: historical and estimated payor mix; statutory discount requirements and contractual terms; historical claims experience and processing time lags; estimated patient population; known market events or trends; market research; channel inventory data obtained from customers; and other pertinent internal or external information. The Company assesses and updates the estimates every quarter to reflect actual claims and other current information.
​
Government and other chargebacks are recognized as reduction of revenue upon the sale to the Customers. These items are payable to customers and other rebates that are payable to other third party payors and healthcare professionals are classified as accrued expense liabilities.
​
Cash Discounts
​
The Company estimates cash discounts based on contractual terms and expectations regarding future customer payment patterns. 
​
Specialty Pharmacy & Distributor Fees
​
Under the inventory management agreements with specialty pharmacies and distributors, the Company pays a fee primarily for compliance with certain contractually determined covenants such as the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels. These specialty pharmacy and distributor fees are based on a contractually determined fixed percentage of sales. 
​
The Company has contracted with certain specialty pharmacies to obtain transactional data related to the products in order to develop a better understanding of the selling channel as well as patient activity and utilization by the Medicaid program and other government agencies and managed care organizations. The Company pays a variable fee to the specialty pharmacies to provide the data. The Company also pay the specialty pharmacies a fee in exchange for providing distribution and inventory management services, including the provision of inventory management data to the Company. The Company estimates the fee for service accruals and allowances based on sales to each specialty pharmacy and the applicable contracted rate.
​
Sales Returns
​
Allowances are made for estimated sales returns by the customers and are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. The Company typically permit returns if the product is out of date or damaged during transition to

​
the common carrier. The Company’s estimates of sales returns are based primarily on the Company’s historical return rate. The Company also takes into consideration known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to ARCALYST.
​
Shipping and Handling
​
Shipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities and not considered to be a separate performance obligation.
​
Other Incentives
​
Other incentives include a co-pay assistance program for eligible patients with commercial insurance in the U.S. The co-pay assistance programs assist certain commercially insured patients by reducing each participating patient’s financial responsibility for the purchase price, up to a specified dollar amount of assistance. 
​
Collaboration Expenses
Collaboration expenses consist of Regeneron’s share of the profit related to ARCALYST sales under the license agreement (the “Regeneron Agreement”) with Regeneron (see Note 13) and the cost of products sold under collaboration agreements. The Company also evenly split with Regeneron any proceeds received by the Company from any licensees, sublicensees and distributors in consideration for the sale, license or other disposition of rights with respect to ARCALYST, including upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties.
License and Collaboration Revenue 
License and collaboration revenue includes amounts recognized related to upfront payments, royalty revenue, milestone payments and products sold under collaboration agreements.

The Company analyzes its collaboration arrangements to assess whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities and therefore within the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements (“Topic 808”). This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of Topic 808 that contain multiple elements, the Company first determines which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of Topic 808 and which elements of the collaboration are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of Topic 606.
For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 606, the Company identifies the performance obligations and allocate the total consideration the Company expects to receive on a relative standalone selling price basis to each performance obligation. Variable consideration such as performance-based milestones will be included in the total consideration if the Company expects to receive such consideration and if it is probable that the inclusion of the variable consideration will not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized under the arrangement. The Company’s estimate of the total consideration the Company expects to receive under each collaboration arrangement is updated for each reporting period, and any adjustments to revenue are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis. The Company excludes sales-based royalty and milestone payments from the total consideration the Company expects to receive until the underlying sales occur because the license to the Company’s intellectual property is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties or milestones relate as it is the primary driver of value in the Company’s collaboration arrangements.
Key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.

​
The Company recognize revenue associated with each performance obligation as the control over the promised goods or services transfer to the Company’s collaboration partner which occurs either at a point in time or over time. If control transfers over time, revenue is recognized by using a method of measuring progress that best depicts the transfer of goods or services. The Company evaluates the measure of progress and related inputs each reporting period and any resulting adjustments to revenue are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis.
Consideration received that does not meet the requirements to satisfy ASC 808 or ASC 606 revenue recognition criteria is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, classified as either short-term (less than 12 months) or long-term (more than 12 months) deferred revenue based on the Company’s best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized.
​
Intangible Assets
Upon FDA approval and commercial launch of ARCALYST in March 2021, the Company capitalized the 
$
20,000
 milestone payment to Regeneron for a specified regulatory milestone as a f
inite-lived
 intangible asset (see Note 13). The intangible asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the underlying intellectual property of 
20 years
. Amortization expense will be recorded as cost of goods sold in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and property and equipment, whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. When such events occur, the Company determines whether there has been an impairment in value by comparing the asset’s carrying value with its fair value, as measured by the anticipated undiscounted net cash flows of the asset. If an impairment in value exists, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. The Company has not recognized any impairment losses through December 31, 2024 and there have been no events that triggered an impairment analysis.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to discover, research and develop drug candidates, including personnel expenses, share-based compensation expense, allocated facility-related and depreciation expenses, third party license fees and external costs of outside vendors engaged to conduct preclinical and clinical development activities and clinical trials as well as to manufacture clinical trial materials. Non-refundable prepayments determined to be used within one year for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. Non-refundable prepayments or minimum balance requirements associated to clinical trials determined to not be used within one year are classified as other long-term assets. Such amounts are recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered, or the services rendered. Milestone and other payments made to third parties with respect to in-process research and development, in accordance with the Company’s license, acquisition and other similar agreements are expensed when determined to be probable and estimable. 
Research Contract Costs
The Company has entered into various research and development-related contracts with companies both inside and outside of the United States. The related costs are recorded as research and development expenses as incurred. The Company records accruals for estimated ongoing research and development costs. When billing terms under these contracts do not coincide with the timing of when the work is performed, the Company is required to make estimates of 
F-17

Table of Contents
KINIKSA PHARMACEUTICALS, LTD.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
​
outstanding obligations to those third parties as of the end of the reporting period. Any accrual estimates are based on a number of factors, including the Company’s knowledge of the progress towards completion of the research and development activities, invoicing to date under the contracts, communication from the research institution or other companies of any actual costs incurred during the period that have not yet been invoiced, and the costs included in the contracts. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from the Company’s estimates. 
Patent Costs
The Company charges patent-related costs in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications to operations as incurred as their realization is uncertain. These costs are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, including share based compensation expense for personnel in selling, marketing, medical, executive, business development, finance, human resources, legal and support personnel functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include external commercialization, marketing, and professional fees for legal, patent, and accounting services.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, advertising costs totaled $
11,433
, $
9,066
 and $
5,725
, respectively.

Share-Based Compensation
The Company measures all share-based awards granted to employees and directors based on their fair value on the date of grant. The Company issues share-based awards with both service-based, performance-based and market-based vesting conditions. The Company recognizes compensation expense for awards with service and market conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards that contain performance conditions, the Company determines the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of performance targets, which requires judgment, including forecasting the achievement of future specified targets. At the date performance conditions are determined to be probable of achievement, the Company records a cumulative expense catch-up, with remaining expense amortized over the remaining service period. Throughout the performance period, the Company re-assesses the estimated performance and updates the number of performance-based awards that the Company believes will ultimately vest. 
For share-based awards granted to consultants and non-employees, compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the awards, which is generally the period during which services are rendered by such consultants and non-employees until completed. 
The Company classifies share-based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the same manner in which the award recipient’s payroll costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified. 
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires inputs based on certain subjective assumptions, including the expected share price volatility, the expected term of the award, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends (see Note 11). Prior to May 2018, the Company was a private company and, accordingly, lacked company-specific historical and implied volatility information for its shares. Therefore, it estimated its expected share price volatility based on the historical volatility of the Company and historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies until such time as it had adequate historical data regarding the 
F-18

Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
​
volatility of its own traded share price. The expected term of the Company’s options has been determined utilizing the “simplified” method for awards that qualify as “plain-vanilla” options. The expected term of options granted to non-employees is equal to the contractual term of the option award. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends on ordinary shares and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
​
The fair value of each restricted share unit award is based on the closing price of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares on the date of grant, with the exception of PSUs with market conditions, which are measured using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The Monte-Carlo valuation model requires the use of assumptions, including but not limited to the expected volatility, correlation coefficients, risk free rate, expected dividend yield and expected term.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) as well as other changes in shareholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with shareholders. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) was comprised of unrealized gain (loss) on short-term investments and currency translation adjustments, net of tax. 
Net Income (Loss) per Share
Basic net income (loss) per share attributable to ordinary shareholders is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders is computed by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders to reallocate undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities. Diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to ordinary shareholders is computed based on the treasury method by dividing the diluted net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period, including potential dilutive ordinary shares. For purpose of this calculation, outstanding share options and unvested restricted share units are considered potential dilutive ordinary shares.
In periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders, diluted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders, since dilutive ordinary shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company reported a net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or in the Company’s tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the (provision) benefit for income taxes. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weighting of the positive and negative available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits expected, cumulative recent earnings and considering prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.

​
Prior to the Redomiciliation, the Company was incorporated and principally subject to taxation in Bermuda. Following the Redomiciliation, the Company is incorporated and principally subject to taxation in the United Kingdom. Under the current laws of Bermuda, tax on a company’s income is assessed at a 
zero
 percent tax rate. As a result, the Company has not recorded any income tax benefits from its losses incurred in Bermuda during the reporting periods in which it was incorporated there, and 
no
 net operating loss carryforwards will be available to the Company for those losses. Following the Redomiciliation, the Company’s income is subject to the enacted United Kingdom statutory corporate tax rate and net operating losses incurred have an indefinite carryforward. The Company’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, Kiniksa US and Primatope, are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Kiniksa Bermuda remains subject to taxation, if any, in Bermuda. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Kiniksa UK, and Kiniksa UK’s wholly owned subsidiaries, Kiniksa Germany, Kiniksa France, and Kiniksa Switzerland are subject to taxation in their respective countries. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries operate under cost plus arrangements. 
​
The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

0.01
 per share (the “KNSA Bermuda Ordinary Share”) and 
50,000
 redeemable preference shares with a nominal value of £

2018 Incentive Award Plan
In May 2018, the Company’s board of directors and shareholders approved the 2018 Incentive Award Plan (the “2018 Plan”), which became effective on May 23, 2018. The 2018 Plan provides for the grant of incentive share options, nonqualified share options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, dividend equivalents, restricted share units and other share- or cash- based awards. Upon the effectiveness of the 2018 Plan, the Company ceased granting awards under its 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the “2015 Plan” together with the 2018 Plan, the “Plans”).
A total of 
4,466,500
 Class A ordinary shares were initially reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan. The number of Class A ordinary shares that may be issued under the 2018 Plan will automatically increase on each January 1, beginning in 2019 and continuing for each fiscal year until, and including, the fiscal year ending December 31, 2028, equal to the lesser of (1) 
4
% of the Class A ordinary shares outstanding (on an as-converted basis)

​
on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year and (2) a smaller number of Class A ordinary shares determined by the Company’s board of directors. As of December 31, 2024, 
5,205,357
 shares remained available for future grant. On January 1, 2025, the Class A ordinary shares issuable pursuant to the 2018 Plan increased by 
2,900,642
 shares, equal to 
4
% of the as-converted Class A ordinary shares outstanding on December 31, 2024. The Class A ordinary shares underlying any awards issued under the 2018 Plan or the 2015 Plan that on or after the effective date of the 2018 Plan expire, lapse unexercised or are terminated, exchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased, canceled without having been fully exercised, or forfeited under the 2018 Plan or the 2015 Plan will be added back to the Class A ordinary shares available for issuance under the 2018 Plan. 
2015 Equity Incentive Plan
Until May 23, 2018 (the effective date of the 2018 Plan), the 2015 Plan provided for the Company to grant incentive share options, nonqualified share options, share grants and other share-based awards to employees and non-employees to purchase the Company’s Class A ordinary shares. On the effective date of the 2018 Plan, the Company ceased granting awards under the 2015 Plan. At that time, the 
4,691,213
 Class A ordinary shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2015 Plan remained reserved for issuance under the plan pursuant to such awards and the 
92,170
 Class A ordinary shares that had been available for future grant under the 2015 Plan were no longer authorized and reserved for issuance or available for future grant under the 2015 Plan.
As of December 31, 2024, there were 
1,433,203
 Class A ordinary shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2015 Plan and reserved for issuance thereunder pursuant to such awards. The 2015 Plan continues to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards granted under it. Class A ordinary shares subject to awards granted under the 2015 Plan that expire, lapse unexercised or are terminated, exchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased, canceled without having been fully exercised, or forfeited become available for issuance under the 2018 Plan.
The exercise price for share options granted under the 2015 Plan was determined by the Company’s board of directors. All incentive share options granted to any person possessing 
10
% or less of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares could not have an exercise price of less than 
100
% of the fair market value of the Class A ordinary shares on the grant date. All incentive share options granted to any person possessing more than 
10
% of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares could not have an exercise price of less than 
110
% of the fair market value of the Class A ordinary shares on the grant date. The option term for incentive share options could not be greater than 
10 years
. Incentive share options granted to persons possessing more than 
10
% of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares could not have an option term of greater than 
five years
. The vesting period for equity-based awards was determined by the board of directors, which was generally 
four
 to 
six years
. For awards granted to employees and non-employees with 
four year
 vesting terms, 
25
% of the option vests on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remaining shares vest equally each month for 
three years
 thereafter. For awards granted to employees with 
six year
 vesting terms, 
16
% of the option vests on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remaining shares vest based on a predetermined vesting schedule for 
five years
 thereafter.
2018 Employee Share Purchase Plan
In May 2018, the Company’s board of directors and shareholders approved the 2018 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the “2018 ESPP”), which became effective on May 23, 2018. A total of 
670,000
 Class A ordinary shares were initially reserved for issuance under the 2018 ESPP. The number of Class A ordinary shares that may be issued under the 2018 ESPP automatically increases on each January 1, beginning in 2019 and continuing for each fiscal year until, and including, the fiscal year ending December 31, 2028, equal to the lesser of (1) 
1
% of the Class A ordinary shares outstanding (on an as-converted basis) on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year and (2) a smaller number of Class A ordinary shares determined by the Company’s board of directors, provided that no more than 
6,420,000
 Class A ordinary shares may be issued under the 2018 ESPP. In December 2024, the Company’s board of directors approved an increase as of January 1, 2025 of 
90,000
 Class A ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2024, 
671,515
 Class A ordinary shares were available for future issuance under the 2018 ESPP.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not grant share options to non-employees. 
Restricted Share Units
RSUs represent the right to receive shares of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares upon vesting of the RSUs. The fair value of each RSU award is based on the closing price of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares on the date of grant.
Starting March 2021, the Company granted RSUs with service conditions (“Time-Based RSUs”) to eligible employees. The Time-Based RSUs vest 
25
% on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to continued employment through such dates.
Rilonacept Long-Term Incentive Plan

In December 2019, the compensation committee of the Company’s board of directors approved the Company’s Rilonacept Long-Term Incentive Plan (“RLTIP”) under the Company’s 2018 Plan to incentivize eligible employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to achieve FDA approval for the commercial sale and marketing of ARCALYST for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis in the United States (“RLTIP Milestone”). The RLTIP provided for eligible employees to receive a cash award and 
two
 grants of RSU awards covering Class A ordinary shares under the 2018 Plan. 

The cash award was eligible to be earned and paid upon the date the RLTIP Milestone was achieved (the “Achievement Date”) with respect to an amount determined in accordance with the RLTIP based on the earnout percentage. The number of Class A ordinary shares issuable under the first RSU award (“First RSU Award”) as a result of the achievement of the RLTIP Milestone was determined in accordance with the RLTIP based on the earnout percentage, and such RSUs vested on the first anniversary of the Achievement Date, subject to continued employment on such date. The second RSU award was granted on the Achievement Date with respect to a number of shares determined in accordance with the RLTIP, based on both the earnout percentage and the upside earnout percentage, and vested on the second anniversary of the Achievement Date, subject to continued employment on such date. 
​
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company granted the First RSU Awards as part of the RLTIP to eligible employees. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the RLTIP Milestone was achieved and 
187,682
 of Class A ordinary shares were issued under the First RSU Awards in accordance with the RLTIP and vested in one installment in March 2022 (on the first anniversary of the Achievement Date). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Second RSU Awards were granted to eligible employees on the Achievement Date with 
142,283
 shares granted in accordance with the RLTIP which vested in one installment in March 2023.

Out-Licensing Agreements
Genentech License Agreement
In August 2022, the Company entered into a license agreement (the “Genentech License Agreement”) with Genentech, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (collectively, “Genentech”), pursuant to which the Company granted Genentech exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize vixarelimab and related antibodies (each, a “Genentech Licensed Product”). The Genentech License Agreement became effective in September 2022 (the “Genentech Effective Date”) following termination of the statutory waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act.
Under the Genentech License Agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $
80,000
 for the license. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company received cash payments of $
20,000
 following delivery of certain drug supplies to Genentech and $
15,000
 following Genentech’s achievement of a development milestone related to a new indication under the Genentech License Agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2023, following the achievement of a development milestone related to a second indication under the Genentech License Agreement, Genentech became obligated to make an additional cash payment of $
10,000
 which the Company received in 2024. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company received a cash payment of $
5,000
 following the achievement of a development milestone related to the third indication under the Genentech License Agreement. Under the terms of the Genentech License Agreement, the Company is eligible to receive a total of approximately $
600,000
 in contingent payments, including specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, before fulfilling the Company’s upstream financial obligations, of which approximately $
570,000
 remain as of December 31, 2024. The Company will also be eligible to receive tiered percentage royalties on a Genentech Licensed Product-by-Genentech Licensed Product basis ranging from low-double digits to mid-teens on annual net sales of each Genentech Licensed Product, subject to certain customary reductions, with an aggregate minimum floor, before fulfilling the Company’s upstream financial obligations. Royalties will be payable on a Genentech Licensed Product-by-Genentech Licensed Product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of the expiration of certain patents that cover a Genentech Licensed Product, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such Genentech Licensed Product, or the tenth anniversary of first commercial sale of such Genentech Licensed Product in such country.
Pursuant and subject to the terms of the Genentech License Agreement, Genentech has the exclusive worldwide right to conduct development and commercialization activities for Genentech Licensed Products at its sole cost. In 2024, the Company fulfilled its responsibility under the Genentech License Agreement with respect to completing its Phase 2b clinical trial assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of vixarelimab in reducing pruritis in prurigo nodularis. 
Under the Genentech License Agreement, Genentech has the right to assume manufacturing responsibilities for Genentech Licensed Products.

​
Absent early termination, the Genentech License Agreement will continue until there are no more royalty or other payment obligations owed to the Company. Genentech has the right to terminate the Genentech License Agreement at its discretion with prior written notice and either party may terminate the Genentech License Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach of the other party or in the case of insolvency of the other party. In addition, the Genentech License Agreement will terminate upon termination of the Biogen Agreement (as defined below).
The Company concluded that Genentech is a customer in this license agreement, and as such, the Genentech License Agreement falls within the scope of the revenue recognition guidance in ASC 606.
Accounting for Genentech License Agreement
As of the Genentech Effective Date, the Company identified the following material promises in the Genentech License Agreement: (i) the delivery of the exclusive license for vixarelimab; (ii) an initial drug supply delivery; (iii) a drug product resupply delivery; and (iv) completion of the Phase 2b clinical trial for vixarelimab.
The Company also evaluated whether certain options outlined within the Genentech License Agreement represented material rights that would give rise to a performance obligation, including the option to purchase additional drug substance, and concluded that none of the options convey a material right to Genentech and therefore are not considered separate performance obligations within the Genentech License Agreement. 
The Company assessed the above promises and determined that the exclusive license for vixarelimab is reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore represents a performance obligation. The exclusive license for vixarelimab is considered functional intellectual property and distinct from other promises under the Genentech License Agreement as Genentech can benefit from the license on its own or together with other readily available resources and the license is separately identifiable from the other promises. The initial drug supply and drug product resupply are considered distinct from the exclusive license for vixarelimab as Genentech can benefit from such supply together with the license transferred by the Company at the inception of the Genentech License Agreement. The completion of the Phase 2b clinical trial is considered distinct from the exclusive license for vixarelimab as Genentech can benefit from the data generated by such trial together with such license. Therefore, each represents a separate performance obligation within a contract with a customer at contract inception.
The Company determined the transaction price at the inception of the Genentech License Agreement which consists of the $
80,000
 upfront payment. The Company determined that the $
20,000
 variable consideration related to the delivery of the initial drug supply and drug product resupply was no longer constrained during the fourth quarter of 2022, as the Company determined that it could assert it was not probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would occur. The Company met the milestone obligation in the first quarter of 2023 and invoiced Genentech for the related $
20,000
 payment for the delivery of certain drug material. In 2023 and 2024, the Company added $
25,000
 and $
5,000
, respectively, to the transaction price following Genentech’s achievement of development milestones under the Genentech License Agreement. The Company determined that all other variable considerations related to the future development and regulatory milestones, are deemed fully constrained and therefore excluded from the transaction price due to the high degree of uncertainty and risk associated with these potential payments, as the Company also determined that it could not assert that it was not probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would occur. The Company also determined that royalties and sales milestones relate solely to the license of intellectual property. Revenue related to these royalties and sales milestones will only be recognized when the associated sales occur, and relevant thresholds are met, under the sales or usage-based royalty exception of Topic 606.
As noted above, the Company identified 
four
 performance obligations in the Genentech License Agreement: (i) the delivery of the exclusive license for vixarelimab; (ii) an initial drug supply delivery; (iii) a drug product resupply delivery; and (iv) completion of the Phase 2b clinical trial for vixarelimab. The selling price of each performance

​
obligation in the Genentech License Agreement was determined based on the Company’s standalone selling price (“SSP”) with the objective of determining the price at which it would sell such an item if it were to be sold regularly on a standalone basis. The Company allocated the transaction price to each of the 
four
 performance obligations noted above.

​
The Company recognized $
5,261
, $
37,083
 and $
87,656
 of collaboration revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, under the Genentech License Agreement related to the license, completed portion of the Phase 2b clinical trial for vixarelimab, and materials delivered. As a result of the $
5,000
 in development milestones achieved by Genentech, the Company recognized revenue of $
4,989
, during the year ended December 31, 2024, related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. The remaining revenue was recognized as a result of the completed portion of the Phase 2b clinical trial for vixarelimab. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has recognized as revenue all of the transaction price associated with the Genentech License Agreement. 
Huadong Collaboration Agreements
In February 2022 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into two collaboration and license agreements (each, a “Huadong Collaboration Agreement” and together, the “Huadong Collaboration Agreements”) with Hangzhou Zhongmei Huadong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Huadong”), pursuant to which the Company granted Huadong exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ARCALYST and develop, manufacture and commercialize mavrilimumab (each, a “Huadong Licensed Product” and together, the “Huadong Licensed Products”) 
in the following countries: People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong SAR, Macao SAR, Taiwan Region, South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, The Philippines, Thailand, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, India, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam (collectively, the “Huadong Territory”).
 The Company otherwise retained its current rights to the Huadong Licensed Products outside the Huadong Territory.
In February 2025, the Company provided written notice to Huadong that Huadong has not conducted material development activity with respect to mavrilimumab in the People’s Republic of China for a continuous period in excess of six months as required under the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement. Unless Huadong conducts material development activity within a prescribed time period, the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement will terminate on April 25, 2025. The Company does not expect to record any significant charges related to the termination of the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement.
Under the Huadong Collaboration Agreements, the Company received a total upfront cash payment of $
22,000
, which included $
12,000
 for the Huadong Territory license of ARCALYST and $
10,000
 for the Huadong Territory license of mavrilimumab. In 2024, following the achievement of a regulatory milestone under the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement, Huadong became obligated to make an additional cash payment of $
20,000
 to the Company. The Company will be eligible to receive up to approximately $
50,000
 in contingent sales-based milestone payments for ARCALYST, all of which remain as of December 31, 2024. Due to its termination, the Company does not expect to

​
receive any future payments under the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement. The Company was eligible to receive up to approximately $
576,000
 in payments for mavrilimumab, including specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, all of which remained as of December 31, 2024. Huadong was also obligated to pay the company tiered percentage royalties ranging from mid-teens to low twenties on annual net sales of mavrilimumab in the Huadong territory. Huadong will also be obligated to pay the Company tiered percentage royalties ranging from the low-to-mid teens on annual net sales of ARCALYST in the Huadong Territory, subject to certain reductions tied to ARCALYST manufacturing costs and certain other customary reductions, with an aggregate minimum floor. Royalties will be payable on ARCALYST on a country-by-country or region-by-region basis until the later of (i) 
12
 years after the first commercial sale of ARCALYST in such country or region in the Huadong Territory, (ii) the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim of the Company’s patent rights or any joint collaboration patent rights that covers ARCALYST in such country or region in the Huadong Territory, and (iii) the expiration of the last regulatory exclusivity for ARCALYST in such country or region in the Huadong Territory.
Pursuant and subject to the terms of the Huadong Collaboration Agreements, Huadong has the exclusive right to conduct Huadong Territory-specific development activities for ARCALYST in the Huadong Territory, the first right to support global development of ARCALYST by serving as the sponsor of the global clinical trials conducted in the Huadong Territory and the exclusive right to commercialize ARCALYST in the Huadong Territory. Huadong will be responsible for all costs of development activities and commercialization in the Huadong Territory. Both the Company and Huadong participate in a joint steering committee, which coordinates and oversees the exploitation of ARCALYST in the Huadong Territory. 
The Company will supply certain materials to support development and commercialization activities for ARCALYST. 
Absent early termination, the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement will continue on a country-by-country or region-by-region basis until there are no more royalty payments owed to the Company in such country or region. Huadong has the right to terminate the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement at its discretion upon 
12
 months’ notice and either party may terminate the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach of the other party or in the case of insolvency of the other party. In addition, the Company may terminate the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement if Huadong or its affiliates or sublicensees challenges the scope, validity, or enforceability of the Company’s patent rights being licensed to Huadong. If Huadong and its affiliates do not conduct any material development or commercialization activities with respect to ARCALYST in the People’s Republic of China for a continuous period of longer than 
six months
, then, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may terminate the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement with 
60 days
’ prior written notice. In addition, Huadong’s rights under the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement in certain regions within the Huadong Territory may be subject to termination upon failure by Huadong to perform certain clinical, development or commercialization activities, as applicable, with respect to the applicable Huadong Licensed Product in such regions. 
The Company concluded that Huadong is a customer in these Huadong Collaboration Agreements, and as such, each Huadong Collaboration Agreement falls within the scope of the revenue recognition guidance in ASC 606. The Company concluded that the Huadong Collaboration Agreements should not be combined and treated as a single arrangement for accounting purposes as the Huadong Collaboration Agreements were negotiated separately with separate and distinct commercial objectives, the amount of consideration in one Huadong Collaboration Agreement is not dependent on the price or performance of the other Huadong Collaboration Agreement, and the goods and services promised in the Huadong Collaboration Agreements are not a single performance obligation.

Accounting for Mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement
As of the Effective Date, the Company identified the following material promises in the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement: delivery of (i) exclusive license for mavrilimumab in the Huadong Territory and (ii) clinical manufacturing supply of certain materials for mavrilimumab products in the Huadong Territory. 
The Company also evaluated whether certain options outlined within the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement represented material rights that would give rise to a performance obligation and concluded that none of the options convey a material right to Huadong and therefore are not considered separate performance obligations within the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement. 
The Company assessed the above promises and determined that the exclusive license for mavrilimumab in the Huadong Territory is reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore represents a performance obligation. The exclusive license for mavrilimumab in the Huadong Territory is considered functional intellectual property and distinct from other promises under the Huadong Collaboration Agreement as Huadong can benefit from the license on its own or together with other readily available resources and the license is separately identifiable from the other promises. The clinical manufacturing supply of certain materials for mavrilimumab products in the Huadong Territory is considered distinct from the exclusive license for mavrilimumab as Huadong can benefit from the manufacturing services together with the license transferred by the Company at the inception of the Huadong Collaboration Agreement. Therefore, each represents a separate performance obligation within a contract with a customer at contract inception. 
The Company determined the transaction price at the inception of the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement which includes $
10,000
, consisting of the upfront payment. The Company also includes an estimate of variable consideration associated with the clinical manufacturing supply of certain materials when those materials are shipped. The Company determined that any variable consideration related to development and regulatory milestones is deemed fully constrained and therefore excluded from the transaction price due to the high degree of uncertainty and risk associated with these potential payments, as the Company determined that it could not assert that it was probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company also determined that royalties and sales milestones relate solely to the licenses of intellectual property. Revenue related to these royalties and sales milestones will only be recognized when the associated sales occur, and relevant thresholds are met, under the sales or usage-based royalty exception of Topic 606.
As noted above, the Company identified 
two
 performance obligations in the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement: (i) the delivery of the exclusive license for mavrilimumab in the Huadong Territory; and (ii) the clinical manufacturing supply of certain materials for mavrilimumab products in the Huadong Territory. The selling price of each performance obligation in the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement was determined based on the Company’s standalone selling price (“SSP”) with the objective of determining the price at which it would sell such an item if it were to be sold regularly on a standalone basis. The Company allocated the variable consideration related to the manufacturing obligations to the future clinical supply of mavrilimumab products in the Huadong Territory and the remaining fixed and variable consideration to the license obligation. The Company recognizes revenue for the license performance obligations at a point in time, that is upon transfer of the license to Huadong. As control of the license was transferred on the Effective Date and Huadong could begin to use and benefit from the license, the Company recognized 
$
10,000
 of collaboration revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022 under the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement. The Company will recognize revenue for the clinical manufacturing supply obligations at a point in time, that is upon each delivery of the supply to Huadong. 
The Company has 
no
t recognized any revenue under the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 as there has been no delivery of clinical manufacturing supply of certain materials under the mavrilimumab Huadong Collaboration Agreement to date.

Accounting for ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement
As of the Effective Date, the Company identified the following material promises in the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement that were evaluated: delivery of (i) exclusive license for ARCALYST in the Huadong Territory; (ii) clinical manufacturing supply of certain materials for ARCALYST products in the Huadong Territory; and (iii) commercial manufacturing supply of certain material for ARCALYST products in the Huadong Territory. 
The Company also evaluated whether certain options outlined within the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement represented material rights that would give rise to a performance obligation and concluded that none of the options convey a material right to Huadong and therefore are not considered separate performance obligations within the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement. 
The Company assessed the above promises and determined that there is 
one
 combined performance obligation for the exclusive license for ARCALYST and clinical and commercial manufacturing obligations for ARCALYST products in the Huadong Territory. Huadong cannot exploit the value of the exclusive license for ARCALYST products in the Huadong Territory without receipt of supply as the exclusive license for ARCALYST products in the Huadong Territory does not convey to Huadong the right to manufacture and therefore the Company has combined the exclusive license for ARCALYST products in the Huadong Territory and the manufacturing obligations into 
one
 performance obligation. 
​
The Company determined the transaction price at the inception of the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement which includes $
12,000
, consisting of the upfront payment. In 2024 the Company added 
20,000
 to the transaction price following the achievement of a regulatory milestone. The Company also includes an estimate of variable consideration associated with the clinical and commercial manufacturing supply of certain materials when those materials are shipped. The Company determined that any variable consideration related to development and regulatory milestones, sales milestones and royalties are deemed fully constrained and therefore excluded from the transaction price due to the high degree of uncertainty and risk associated with these potential payments, as the Company determined that it could not assert that it was probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Royalties and sales milestones will be recognized as the Company delivers the commercial manufactured product to Huadong. Any changes in estimates may result in a cumulative catch-up based on the number of units of manufactured product delivered.
​
As noted above, the Company identified a single combined performance obligation in the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement consisting of the exclusive license for ARCALYST and clinical and commercial manufacturing obligations for ARCALYST products in the Huadong Territory. The Company recognizes revenue for the combined performance obligation consisting of the exclusive license for ARCALYST and clinical and commercial manufacturing obligations for ARCALYST products in the Huadong Territory at a point in time, upon which control of materials are transferred to Huadong for each delivery of the associated materials. The Company currently expects to recognize the revenue over the life of the agreement. This estimate considers the timing of development and commercial activities under the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement and may be reduced or increased based on changes in the various activities. 
​
The Company recognized $
189
 of the transaction price in collaboration revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024, under the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement related to materials delivered. The Company has 
no
t recognized any revenue under the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 as there were 
no
 deliveries of materials under the ARCALYST Huadong Collaboration Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, $
31,811
 is recorded in non-current deferred revenue, based upon timing of anticipated future shipments.

13.           License and Acquisition Agreements 
Biogen Asset Purchase Agreement
In September 2016, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Biogen Agreement”) with Biogen MA Inc. (“Biogen”) to acquire all of Biogen’s right, title and interest in and to certain assets used in or relating to vixarelimab and other antibodies covered by certain patent rights, including patents and other intellectual property rights, clinical data, know-how, and clinical drug supply. In addition, Biogen granted to the Company a non-exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain background patent rights related to the vixarelimab program. The Company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize such acquired products.
In exchange for these rights, the Company made an upfront payment to Biogen of $
11,500
 and a technology transfer payment of $
500
. The Company accounted for the acquisition of technology as an asset acquisition because it did not meet the definition of a business. The Company recorded the upfront payment and technology transfer payment as research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) because the acquired technology represented in-process research and development and had no alternative future use.
Under the Biogen Agreement, the Company is obligated to make milestone payments to Biogen of up to $
179,000
 upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones in multiple indications in various territories, of which $
165,000
 remains as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, the Company could be obligated to make up to an aggregate of up to $
150,000
 of payments upon the achievement of specified annual net sales milestones and to pay tiered royalties on escalating tiers of annual net sales of licensed products starting in the high single-digit percentages and ending below the teens.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
​
The Company also agreed to pay certain obligations under third party contracts retained by Biogen that relate to the vixarelimab program. Under these retained contracts, the Company paid a one-time upfront sublicense fee of $
150
 and is obligated to pay insignificant annual maintenance fees as well as clinical and regulatory milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $
1,575
. The Biogen Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of all payment obligations with respect to the last product in all countries in the territory. The Company has the right to terminate the agreement with 
90 days
’ prior written notice. Both parties may terminate by mutual written consent or in the event of material breach of the agreement by the other party that remains uncured for 
90 days
 (or 
30 days
 for payment-related breaches).
In July 2017, the Company and Biogen entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Biogen Agreement, which clarified the scope of the antibodies subject to the Biogen Agreement.
In August 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Biogen Agreement (the “Second Biogen Amendment”). Pursuant to the terms of the Second Biogen Amendment, commencing on the effective date of the Genentech License Agreement, certain defined terms in the Biogen Agreement were amended, including “Net Sales”, “Indication”, “Product”, “Combination Product” and “Valid Claim”. In addition, the tiered royalty rates to be paid by the Company to Biogen increased by an amount equal to less than 
one
 percent.
Upon the termination or expiration of the Genentech License Agreement, the amendments to the terms of the Biogen Agreement, as set forth in the Second Biogen Amendment, will terminate and all terms of the Biogen Agreement will revert to the version of such terms in effect as of immediately prior to the effective date of the Genentech License Agreement.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded expenses of $
144
, $
94
 and $
56
 respectively, related to a milestone and the annual maintenance fee in connection with the retained contracts. 
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center License Agreement
 In 2019, the Company acquired all of the outstanding securities of Primatope Therapeutics, Inc. (“Primatope”), the company that owned or controlled the intellectual property related to abiprubart (
also known as KPL-404). In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Primatope, the Company acquired the rights to an exclusive license to certain intellectual property rights controlled by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Inc. (“BIDMC”) to make, use, develop and commercialize abiprubart (the “BIDMC Agreement”). Under the BIDMC Agreement, the Company is solely responsible for all development, regulatory and commercial activities and costs. The Company is also responsible for costs related to filing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patent rights. Under the BIDMC Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay an insignificant annual maintenance fee as well as clinical and regulatory milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $
1,200
 to BIDMC. The Company is also obligated to pay a low single-digit royalty on annual net sales of products licensed under the agreement.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded expenses of $
10
, $
40
 and $
10
, respectively in connection with the BIDMC Agreement.
Regeneron License Agreement

Upon receiving positive data in RHAPSODY, the Company’s pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of ARCALYST, Regeneron transferred the biologics license application (“BLA”) for ARCALYST to the Company.

treatment of recurrent pericarditis and reduction in risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years and older, the Company assumed the sales and distribution of ARCALYST for CAPS and DIRA in the United States.
The Company has made $
32,500
 in payments under the Regeneron Agreement in connection with upfront fees and achievement of regulatory milestones, including a $
20,000
 payment in the first quarter of 2021 in connection with the achievement of a regulatory milestone. The Company accounted for the acquisition of technology as an asset acquisition because it did not meet the definition of a business.
​
The Company evenly splits profits on sales of ARCALYST with Regeneron, where profits are determined after deducting from net sales of ARCALYST certain costs related to the manufacturing and commercialization of ARCALYST. Such costs include but are not limited to (i) the Company’s cost of goods sold for product used, sold or otherwise distributed for patient use by the Company; (ii) customary commercialization expenses, including the cost of the Company’s field force, and (iii) the Company’s cost to market, advertise and otherwise promote ARCALYST, with such costs identified in subsection (iii) subject to specified limits.  To the extent permitted in accordance with the Regeneron Agreement, the fully-burdened costs incurred by each of the Company and Regeneron in performing (or having performed) the technology transfer of the manufacturing process for ARCALYST drug substance will also be deducted from net sales of ARCALYST to determine profit. The Company also evenly splits with Regeneron any proceeds received by the Company from any licensees, sublicensees and distributors in consideration for the sale, license or other disposition of rights with respect to ARCALYST, including upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $
127,375
, $
56,524
 and $
24,071
 respectively, of expenses related to the profit sharing agreement presented within collaboration expenses. 
​
Pursuant to the Regeneron Agreement, in September 2017, the parties entered into a clinical supply agreement under which Regeneron agreed to manufacture product solely for the Company’s use in development activities. Pursuant to the Regeneron Agreement, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into a commercial supply agreement under which Regeneron agreed to manufacture product for the Company’s use, including for commercial sales. The commercial supply agreement terminates upon the sooner of the termination of the Regeneron Agreement and the date of completion of the transfer of technology related to the manufacture of ARCALYST. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred $
1,356
 of research and development expense related to the purchase of drug materials under the clinical supply agreement. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022, the Company did 
no
t incur any research and development expense related to the purchase of drug materials under the clinical supply agreement. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded inventory of $
21,246
 and $
31,122
 related to the purchase of commercial product under the commercial supply agreement (see Note 5). As of December 31, 2024, the Company had non-cancelable purchase commitments under the commercial supply agreement (see Note 16). 
The Regeneron Agreement will expire when the Company is no longer developing or commercializing any licensed product under the Regeneron Agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy or for material breach of the agreement by the other party that remains uncured for 
90 days
 (or 
30 days
 for payment related breaches). Regeneron has the right to terminate the agreement if the Company suspends its development or commercialization activities for a consecutive 
12 month
 period or does not grant a sublicense to a third party to perform such activities, or if the Company challenges any of the licensed patent rights. The Company may terminate the agreement at any time with 
one year
’s written notice. The Company may also terminate the agreement with 
three months
’ written notice if the licensed product is determined to have certain safety concerns.
MedImmune License Agreement
In December 2017, the Company entered into a license agreement (as amended from time to time, the “MedImmune Agreement”) with MedImmune, Limited (subsequently acquired by AstraZeneca PLC) (“MedImmune”), pursuant to which MedImmune granted the Company an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain intellectual property rights to make, use, develop and commercialize mavrilimumab. Under the MedImmune Agreement, 
F-39

Table of Contents
KINIKSA PHARMACEUTICALS, LTD.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
​
the Company also acquired reference rights to relevant manufacturing and regulatory documents and MedImmune’s existing supply of mavrilimumab drug substance and product. The Company was obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed products.
In February 2025, the Company delivered a notice of termination to MedImmune, notifying them of its intent to terminate the MedImmune Agreement, for convenience, effective May 22, 2025. Following such date, the exclusive worldwide sublicense rights to certain intellectual property rights to make, use, develop and commercialize mavrilimumab will be returned to MedImmune. The Company does not expect to record any significant charges related to the termination of the MedImmune Agreement. 
In exchange for these rights, the Company made an upfront payment of 
$
8,000
. The Company accounted for the acquisition of technology as an asset acquisition because it did not meet the definition of a business. The Company recorded the upfront payment as research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) because the acquired technology represented in-process research and development and had no alternative future use.
​
Under the terms of the MedImmune Agreement, the Company was obligated to make clinical, regulatory and initial sales milestone payments of up to 
$
72,500
 in aggregate for the first two indications, including, a 
$
5,000
 pass-through payment due upon the achievement of a specified clinical milestone event which was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018. Also included was a milestone payment of 
$
10,000
 due upon the earlier to occur of a specified regulatory milestone and December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company made both the 
$
5,000
 and 
$
10,000
 previously accrued milestone payments in accordance with the MedImmune Agreement. In addition, the Company was obligated to make clinical and regulatory milestone payments of up to 
$
15,000
 in the aggregate for each subsequent indication. In July 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to the MedImmune Agreement to establish a new coronavirus field and defer the payment of certain development and regulatory milestones as applied to the new coronavirus field. 
​
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did 
no
t record expenses in connection with milestone payments due under the MedImmune Agreement. 
​

​
14.         Income Taxes 
Prior to the Redomiciliation, the Company was incorporated and principally subject to taxation in Bermuda. Following the Redomiciliation, the Company is incorporated and principally subject to taxation in the United Kingdom. Under the current laws of Bermuda, tax on a company’s income is assessed at a 
zero
 percent tax rate. As a result, the Company has 
no
t recorded any income tax benefits from its losses incurred in Bermuda during the reporting periods in which it was incorporated there, and 
no
 net operating loss carryforwards will be available to the Company for those losses. Following the Redomiciliation, the Company’s income is subject to the enacted United Kingdom statutory corporate tax rate and net operating losses incurred have an indefinite carryforward. The Company’s wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, Kiniksa US and Primatope, are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Kiniksa Bermuda remains subject to taxation, if any, in Bermuda. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Kiniksa UK, and Kiniksa UK’s wholly owned subsidiaries, Kiniksa Germany, Kiniksa France, and Kiniksa Switzerland are subject to taxation in their respective countries. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries operate under cost plus arrangements. 
Since 2021, the Company has engaged in a series of intra-entity asset transfers and allocations to contribute assets to its wholly owned Switzerland subsidiary, UK subsidiary and its UK Swiss branch office. 
In January 2021, in connection with its launch readiness activities, Kiniksa Bermuda contributed all of its rights, title and interest in, among other things, certain contracts (including the Regeneron Agreement), intellectual

(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
​
property rights, product filings and approvals and other information, plans and materials owned or controlled by Kiniksa Bermuda insofar as they related exclusively or primarily to ARCALYST to Kiniksa UK. 
In February 2022, Kiniksa Bermuda contributed its exclusive rights to develop and commercialize mavrilimumab in the Huadong Territory to Kiniksa UK. 
In July 2022, Kiniksa Bermuda contributed all of its rights, title and interest in, among other things, certain contracts (including the Biogen Agreement), intellectual property rights, product filings and approvals and other information, plans and materials owned or controlled by Kiniksa Bermuda insofar as they related exclusively or primarily to vixarelimab to Kiniksa UK.
The consolidated Company did not incur tax liabilities on any of these intra-entity transfers since the transferor, Kiniksa Bermuda, is exempt from income tax in Bermuda, its jurisdiction of incorporation. Kiniksa UK accounted for the 2021 and 2022 intra-entity transfers as transfers of assets between related parties and received stepped up tax bases in the contributed intellectual property assets, equal to the fair value of the assets at the time of transfer. The Company recorded UK deferred tax assets as a result of these contributions, which represent the difference between the stepped-up tax bases and the book bases for financial statement purposes. At the time of the 2021 and 2022 transfers of the relevant assets, the Company recorded a valuation allowance on the full amount of the recognized deferred tax assets.

The fair value of the January 2021 transfer of ARCALYST intellectual property assets was determined utilizing forecasted cash flows attributable to commercial operations and estimated probabilities of success of such cash flows, discounted to present value utilizing the discounted cash flow method. The fair values of the transferred mavrilimumab and vixarelimab intellectual property assets were determined utilizing future cash flows related to agreements with third parties for the use of the applicable intellectual property and estimated probabilities of success of such cash flows, discounted to present value utilizing the discounted cash flow method.
In December 2023, Kiniksa UK allocated all of its rights, title and interest in, among other things, certain contracts (including the Regeneron Agreement), intellectual property rights, product filings and approvals and other information, plans and inventory owned or controlled by the Company insofar as they related exclusively or primarily to ARCALYST to Kiniksa UK’s Swiss branch office.
The December 2023 allocation of the assets to the Swiss branch did not result in a taxable disposal for Kiniksa UK as the allocation was to a branch within the entity. The future results of Kiniksa UK’s Swiss branch office are subject to income taxes in Switzerland and the Company expects it will not be subject to tax in the UK. Kiniksa UK’s Swiss branch office received a step up in basis resulting in a Swiss deferred tax asset. The fair value of the allocated ARCALYST intellectual property assets was determined utilizing forecasted cash flows attributable to commercial operations and estimated probabilities of success of such cash flows, discounted to present value utilizing the discounted cash flow method. The fair value of the ARCALYST inventory was determined utilizing the average net selling price less estimated costs to sell.

In January 2024, Kiniksa Bermuda transferred to Kiniksa Switzerland all rights, title and interest in, among other things, certain contracts, intellectual property rights, product filings and approvals and other information, plans and materials owned insofar as they related exclusively or primarily to abiprubart, mavrilimumab, KPL-387 and certain preclinical assets, excluding certain rights necessary for the completion of Cohort 4 of the Company’s ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of abiprubart in rheumatoid arthritis
.
 In June 2024, Kiniksa UK terminated its exclusive rights to develop and commercialize mavrilimumab in the Huadong Territory, with such rights reverting to Kiniksa Switzerland. Thereafter Kiniksa Switzerland held worldwide rights to develop and commercialize mavrilimumab. In October 2024, Kiniksa UK contributed all of its rights, title and interest in, among other things, certain contracts (including the Biogen Agreement), intellectual property rights, product filings and approvals and other information, plans and materials owned or controlled by Kiniksa UK insofar as they related exclusively or primarily to vixarelimab to Kiniksa Switzerland.

​
The consolidated Company did not incur tax liabilities on any of the January 2024 intra-entity transfers since the transferor, Kiniksa Bermuda, is exempt from income tax in Bermuda. Kiniksa Switzerland accounted for the intra-entity transfers as transfers of assets between related parties and received stepped up tax bases in the contributed intellectual property assets, equal to the fair value of the assets at the time of transfer. In relation to the June 2024 transaction, Kiniksa UK received consideration in exchange for the termination of exclusive rights. Neither Kiniksa UK nor Kiniksa Switzerland incurred any tax liabilities as a result of the transaction. The consolidated Company did not incur tax liabilities on any of the October 2024 intra-entity transfers since the transferor, Kiniksa UK, is the sole direct shareholder of Kiniksa Switzerland. Kiniksa Switzerland accounted for the intra-entity transfers as transfers of assets between related parties and received stepped up tax bases in the contributed intellectual property assets, equal to the fair value of the assets at the time of transfer.
The fair values of the transferred assets were determined utilizing future cash flows of projected operations and estimated probabilities of success of such cash flows, discounted to present value utilizing the discounted cash flow method. The Company recorded deferred tax assets as a result of these contributions, which represent the difference between the stepped-up tax bases and the book bases for financial statement purposes. Subsequent to the contribution there was a triggering event resulting in decreases to the tax asset balance related to mavrilimumab intangible assets. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on the full amount of the Kiniksa Switzerland deferred tax assets. There are 
no
 material deferred tax assets in the jurisdictions outside the United States, UK and Switzerland.

As required by ASC 740 management regularly reassesses the valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred income tax assets. Valuation allowances require an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to recover its deferred tax assets. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.
In the third quarter of 2022, the Company assessed the valuation allowance on its UK deferred tax assets and considered positive evidence, including, among other things, cumulative UK income in recent years, estimates of sales related to the Company’s commercial product ARCALYST, and future profitability by jurisdiction. After assessing both the positive evidence and negative evidence, the Company determined it was more likely than not that its UK deferred tax assets would be realized in the future and released the associated valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2022. This resulted in a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $
185,495
. As of December 31, 2022, the Company maintained a full valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets.

​
In the second quarter of 2023, the Company assessed the valuation allowance on its U.S. deferred tax assets and considered positive evidence, including cumulative U.S. income in recent years, primarily related to cost plus arrangements and expectations regarding future profitability. The Company determined it was more likely than not that its U.S. deferred tax assets are realizable in the future and released the associated valuation allowance as of June 30, 2023. 
​
In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company assessed the valuation allowance on its Kiniksa UK deferred tax assets and considered positive and negative evidence, including among other things, the impact of future profitability decreasing in the UK as a result of the allocation of ARCALYST to the Swiss branch office. After assessing both the positive and negative evidence, the Company determined it was more likely than not that a portion of the UK deferred tax assets would not be realized in the future and established a partial valuation allowance on those assets during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
​
The Company recognized a non-cash deferred tax benefit of $
33,788
 during the year ended December 31, 2023. This benefit primarily resulted from the step up in basis of intangible assets and inventory received in Switzerland associated with the allocation of ARCALYST to the Swiss branch office and the release of the U.S. valuation allowance. This was partially offset by the establishment of a partial UK valuation allowance. There are no material deferred tax assets in the jurisdictions outside the United States, UK and Switzerland.
​
Utilization of the state research and development tax credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 due to ownership changes that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders or public groups in the shares of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period.
Changes in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes were as follows:

 in 2023 primarily as a result of the establishment of the valuation allowance for the UK deferred tax assets which primarily consisted of the tax basis in intellectual property transferred from Bermuda and net operating losses.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $
13,390
, $
1,794
 and $

 as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The net change in 2024, 2023 and 2022 relate to tax positions on the Company’s intellectual property transfers and positions on research and development credits.

The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties related to income taxes as part of its income tax provision. The Company had recorded immaterial interest on the tax positions during the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
The Company files U.S. federal income tax returns and income tax returns in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s income tax returns are subject to tax examinations for the tax years ended December 31, 2021 and subsequent years. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period.
No additional provision has been made for withholding taxes related to undistributed foreign earnings of the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries. The Company has determined that unremitted foreign earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested to the extent foreign earnings can be distributed without a significant tax cost. As such, the Company has estimated that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings.

​
15.        Net Income (Loss) per Share 
The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A, Class B, Class A1 and Class B1 ordinary shares are identical, except with respect to voting, transferability and conversion (see Note 10). As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, losses are allocated on a proportionate basis and the resulting net income (loss) per share attributed to ordinary shareholders will, therefore, be the same for both Class A and Class B ordinary shares on an individual or combined basis.

The Company’s unvested RSUs and PSUs have been excluded from the computation of basic net income (loss) per share attributable to ordinary shareholders.
Diluted earnings per share includes the assumed exercise of dilutive options and the assumed issuance of unvested RSUs and performance-based awards for which the performance condition has been met as of the date of determination, using the treasury stock method unless the effect is anti-dilutive. The treasury stock method assumes that proceeds, including cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and the average unrecognized compensation expense for unvested share-based compensation awards, would be used to purchase the Company’s ordinary stock at the average market price during the period.
For year ended December 31, 2024 the Company’s potentially dilutive securities, which include options, unvested RSUs and unvested PSUs, have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders for the periods indicated as the effect would be to reduce the net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders. Therefore, the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders is the same. The Company excluded the following potential ordinary shares, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to ordinary shareholders for the periods indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:

Indemnification Agreements
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its board of directors, officers and other key personnel that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or other key personnel. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any claims under indemnification arrangements will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and it has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.
Legal Proceedings

17. 
Segment Information
The Company manages its operations as a single operating segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company’s singular focus is on developing and commercializing novel therapies that target cardiovascular diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer. The Company’s CODM reviews consolidated operating results and decides how to allocate resources based on net income that also is reported on the income statement as consolidated net income. The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets. The CODM utilizes net income to make key decisions about how to allocate resources across the Company’s commercial product and development programs.
