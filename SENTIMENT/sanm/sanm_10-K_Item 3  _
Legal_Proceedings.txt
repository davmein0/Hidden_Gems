Overview

We are a leading global provider of integrated manufacturing solutions, components, products and repair, logistics and after-market services. Our revenue is generated from sales of our products and services primarily to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that serve the industrial, medical, defense and aerospace, automotive, communications networks and cloud solutions industries.
Our operations are managed as two businesses:  
1)  Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (“IMS”). IMS is a single operating segment consisting of printed circuit board (“PCB”) assembly and test, high-level assembly and test and direct-order-fulfillment. 
2)  Components, Products and Services (“CPS”). Components include advanced PCBs, backplanes and backplane assemblies, cable assemblies, fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts. Products include optical, radio frequency (“RF”) and microelectronic design and manufacturing services from our Advanced Microsystems Technologies division; multi-chip package memory solutions from our Viking Technology division; high-performance storage platforms for hyperscale and enterprise solutions from our Viking Enterprise Solutions division; defense and aerospace products, design, manufacturing, repair and refurbishment services from our SCI Technology, Inc. (“SCI”) subsidiary; and cloud-based smart manufacturing execution software from our 42Q division. Services include design, engineering, and logistics and repair. 
Our only reportable segment for financial reporting purposes is IMS, which represented approximately 80% of our total revenue in 2025. Our CPS business consists of multiple operating segments which do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for being presented as reportable segments. Therefore, financial information for these operating segments is combined and presented in a single category called “CPS”.

Our strategy is to leverage our comprehensive product and service offerings, advanced technologies and global capabilities to further penetrate diverse end markets that we believe offer significant growth opportunities and have complex products that require higher value-added services. We believe this strategy differentiates us from our competitors and will help drive more sustainable revenue growth and provide opportunities for us to achieve operating margins that exceed industry standards. 
A core component of our business strategy is to secure and retain long-term customer partnerships with leading companies in growth industries, capitalizing on our global/regional footprint and unique value proposition in advanced electronics manufacturing. We provide tailored solutions by leveraging our technical capabilities in design, technology, assembly, integration, and after-sales services, aligning them with facilities globally. Historically, we have had substantial recurring sales to existing customers. Sales to our ten largest customers represent approximately 50% of net sales. 
We typically enter into long-term supply agreements with our major OEM customers. These agreements generally have terms ranging from three to five years and cover the manufacture of a range of products. Under these agreements, we manufacture products to customers’ unique specification leveraging our global factory footprint in locations chosen by our customers. However, these agreements generally do not obligate the customer to purchase minimum quantities of products. In addition, some customer contracts contain cost reduction objectives, which can have the effect of reducing revenue from such customers.
We generate about 80% of our net sales from products manufactured in our foreign operations. The concentration of foreign operations has resulted primarily from a desire on the part of many of our customers to manufacture in lower-cost locations in regions such as Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe and we plan to expand our presence as appropriate to meet the needs of our customers. We also intend to continue to invest in factory automation, process improvements, robotics and artificial intelligence, keeping up with the trends in technology to further enhance our efficiency output. 
Trends and Uncertainties

We believe our end-to-end manufacturing solutions combined with our global supply chain management expertise differentiate us from our competitors and enable us to better serve the needs of OEM customers. However, our business faces many challenges. For example, we compete with a number of companies in each of our key end markets. This includes companies that are much larger than we are and smaller companies that focus on a particular niche product, service or end market. Although we believe we are well-positioned in each of our key end markets and offer many advantages compared to our competitors, profitably growing revenues are often constrained by intense competition. Additionally, we are impacted by macroeconomic challenges such as tariffs, inflation, supply chain constraints, foreign currency fluctuations, high interest rates, market volatility and recession concerns that have been and could be in the future exacerbated by geopolitical environment such as the tensions between the U.S. and other nations, conflict in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine.
Further, uncertainties around U.S. tariffs, retaliatory tariffs from other countries, and import/export restrictions may impact customer decisions to use our services in certain manufacturing locations and increase the complexity and cost of our supply chain. Although our customers are generally liable for tariffs we pay for components and finished products, our gross margins could be impacted if we are unable to fully recover these costs. The timing of tariff recovery from customers could adversely affect our operating cash flow in a given period.
Despite these challenges, we remain focused on improving our operations, building flexibility and efficiencies in our processes and adjusting our business models to changing circumstances. We intend to continue diversifying into mission critical markets and creating a portfolio of more complex, higher technology products with longer product life cycles. As our end markets evolve and grow, our ability to optimize our product and portfolio mix towards higher value opportunities will continue to be an important driver for our business going forward. 
Acquisition of ZT Systems
In line with our strategic intent to expand our presence in the Cloud and Artificial Intelligence ecosystem, we acquired the data center infrastructure manufacturing business, excluding certain research and development functions, of ZT Group Int’l, Inc. (“ZT Systems”), from AMD Design, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. On October 27, 2025 (the “Closing Date”), we completed the acquisition of ZT Systems (the “ZT Acquisition”) for an aggregate consideration of $1.6 billion consisting of $1.46 billion in cash consideration (subject to adjustment for certain working capital and other items), a number of shares of our common stock valued at $150 million and up to $450 million contingent cash consideration upon the achievement of certain financial metrics during the three-year period following the closing of ZT Systems acquisition.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). We review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the processes used to develop estimates related to accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, environmental matters, litigation and other contingencies, as well as estimates related to costs expected to be incurred to satisfy performance obligations under long-term contracts and variable consideration related to such contracts. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We have considered information available to us as of the date of issuance of these financial statements and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that would require an update to our estimates or judgments, or a revision to the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. Our estimates may change as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 

We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used by us in preparing our consolidated financial statements:
Revenue Recognition
— We recognize revenue for the majority of our contracts on an over time basis. This is primarily due to the fact that we do not have an alternative use for the end products we manufacture for our customers and have an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit, for work in progress upon a customer’s cancellation of a contract for convenience. In certain circumstances, we recognize over time because our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by our services or, our customer controls the end product as we perform manufacturing services (continuous transfer of control).
In our Defense and Aerospace division, we apply the cost-to-cost method for government contracts which requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs included in the total estimated costs at completion. Additionally, we evaluate whether contract modifications for claims have been approved and, if so, estimate the amount, if any, of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price of the contract.
Estimates of materials, labor and subcontractor costs expected to be incurred to satisfy a performance obligation are updated on a quarterly basis. These estimates consider costs incurred to date and estimated costs to be incurred over the remaining expected period of performance to satisfy a performance obligation. There is inherent uncertainty in estimating the amount of costs that will be required to complete a contract. Factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in estimates include, among others, (1) the long-term duration of contracts, (2) the highly-complex nature of the products we manufacture, (3) the readiness of our customer’s design for manufacturing, (4) the cost and availability of purchased materials, (5) labor cost, availability and productivity, (6) subcontractor performance and (7) the risk of delayed performance/completion. Therefore, such estimates are reviewed each quarter by a group of employees that includes representatives from numerous functions such as engineering, materials, contracts, manufacturing, program management, finance and senior management. If a change in estimate is deemed necessary, the impact of the change is recognized in the period of change. Additionally, contract modifications for claims are assessed each quarter to determine whether the claims have been approved. If it is determined that a claim has been approved, the amount of the claim, if any, that can be included in transaction price is estimated considering a number of factors such as the length of time expected to lapse until uncertainty about the claim has been resolved and the extent to which our experience with claims for similar contracts has predictive value.
Changes in our estimates of transaction price and/or costs to complete may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to revenue and operating income. The impact of changes in estimates on revenue and operating income resulting from application of the cost-to-cost method for recognizing revenue was as follows:

For contracts for which revenue is required to be recognized at a point-in-time, we recognize revenue when we have transferred control of the related goods, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of the goods to the customer. Revenue streams for which revenue is recognized at a point-in-time include our proprietary products and sales of raw materials.
Inventories—
 We state inventories at the lower of cost (based on standard cost, which approximates first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Cost includes raw materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. We regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and make provisions to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. The ultimate realization of inventory carrying amounts is affected by changes in customer demand for inventory that customers are not contractually obligated to purchase and inventory held for specific customers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Inventory write-downs are recorded based on forecasted demand, past experience with specific customers, the ability to redistribute inventory to other programs or return inventories to our suppliers, and whether customers are contractually obligated and have the ability to pay for the related inventory. 

We generally procure inventory based on specific customer orders and forecasts. Customers generally have limited rights of modification (for example, rescheduling or cancellations) with respect to specific orders. Customer modifications of orders affecting inventory previously procured by us and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs may result in excess and obsolete inventory. Although we may be able to use some excess inventory for other products we manufacture, a portion of this excess inventory may not be returnable to vendors or recoverable from customers. In certain instances, in accordance with agreed terms, we receive advances from customers to offset our working capital investment in raw materials. Write-offs or write-downs of inventory could be caused by:
•
changes in customer demand for inventory, such as cancellation of orders, and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs that result in excess quantities on hand that we are not able to return to the vendor, use to fulfill orders from other customers or charge back to the customer;
•
financial difficulties experienced by specific customers for whom we hold inventory; and
•
declines in the market value of inventory. 
Our raw materials inventories are generally acquired in anticipation of specific customer orders and pursuant to customer-specific design specifications. When we and our customers agree that the quantity of customer-specific inventory is in excess of anticipated demand, we may seek advance payments from our customers against such inventories. These advances are presented under deferred revenue and customer advances on the consolidated balance sheets. In the past, in some arrangements with some customers, we transferred control of excess inventories to our customers in exchange for a cash payment, which resulted in a derecognition of the inventory. Those transactions were reported as transfers of non-financial assets – i.e., reported on a net basis in the income statement – and not included in revenue.
Consolidation
— In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 810, we consolidate our Indian manufacturing entity, even though we only hold 49.9% of its outstanding shares. This is because we have the unilateral ability to make all significant financial and operating decisions for the entity. We concluded that, despite not having a majority ownership, we have a controlling financial interest, which requires us to consolidate the entity. We periodically assess this arrangement to determine if there is any change in facts and circumstances that might require us to deconsolidate the entity.
Income Taxes—
 We estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We believe our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter. Although we believe our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate, tax regulations are subject to interpretation and the tax controversy process is inherently lengthy and uncertain; therefore, our assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. To the extent the probable tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact our income tax provision in the period in which such 
35
Table of Contents
determination is made. We only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold of being upheld. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.

We must also make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. We evaluate positive and negative evidence each reporting period when assessing the need for a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if we believe realization of such assets is not more likely than not. Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, new or modified tax laws, tax planning strategies or other factors. If our assumptions, and consequently our estimates, change in the future, the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense. 
Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the amount and geographic distribution of our worldwide income or losses, the tax regulations, rates and holidays in each geographic region, the utilization of net operating losses, the availability of tax credits and carryforwards, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.

Comparison of 2025 to 2024 by End Market
The increase in sales was primarily due to new program wins and program ramp-ups in our communications networks and cloud infrastructure, as well as our medical end markets.
Gross Margin

Gross margin was 8.8%, 8.5% and 8.3% in 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. IMS gross margin increased slightly to 7.7% in 2025 from 7.5% in 2024. CPS gross margin increased to 13.9% in 2025 from 12.8% in 2024, primarily due to improved operating efficiencies partially offset by unfavorable product mix.
We have experienced fluctuations in gross margin in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Fluctuations in our gross margin may be caused by a number of factors, including:
•
the impacts of supply chain constraints on our operations, the operations of our suppliers and on our customers’ businesses;
•
capacity utilization which, if lower, results in lower margins due to fixed costs being absorbed by lower volumes;
•
changes in the mix of high and low margin products demanded by our customers;
•
competition in the EMS industry and pricing pressures from OEMs due to greater focus on cost reduction;
37
Table of Contents
•
the amount of our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, including those associated with distressed customers;
•
levels of operational efficiency and production yields; 
•
our performance on long-term contracts, including our ability to recover claims for cost overruns; and
•
our ability to transition the location of and ramp up manufacturing and assembly operations when requested by a customer in a timely and cost-effective manner.
Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $290 million and $266 million in 2025 and 2024, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 3.6% and 3.5% for 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars in 2025 from 2024 was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation, largely due to increased stock compensation expense from new equity grants and variable compensation, as well as higher professional fees and increased expenditures supporting IT systems.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses were $31 million and $29 million in 2025 and 2024, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses were 0.4% for each of 2025 and 2024. The increase in absolute dollars in 2025 from 2024 was primarily due to higher expenses for design and engineering support for existing projects.
Acquisition and Integration Charges
Acquisition and integration charges were $34 million in 2025 and are related to the acquisition of ZT Systems. There were no such charges in prior years. 
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net was $(11) million in 2025 and $(1) million in 2024. The increase in other expense in 2025 was primarily caused by a lower market-value gain on participant investment accounts in our deferred compensation plan compared to 2024 as a result of the total return swap contract (“TRS”) entered in the second quarter of 2025 that substantially offsets changes in the deferred compensation plan liabilities elections made by plan participants.
Provision for Income Taxes

We recorded income tax expense of $73 million and $80 million in 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 22% and 25% for 2025 and 2024, respectively. The tax rate was lower in 2025 primarily due to the release of tax reserves.
As a result of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for fiscal 2008 through 2010, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) on November 17, 2023 asserting an underpayment of tax of approximately $8 million for fiscal 2009. The asserted underpayment results from the IRS’s proposed disallowance of a 
$503 million
 worthless stock deduction in fiscal 2009. Such disallowance, if upheld, would reduce our available net operating loss carryforwards and result in additional tax and interest attributable to fiscal 2021 and later years, which could be material. We disagree with the IRS’s position as asserted in the RAR and are vigorously contesting this matter through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. We cannot predict with any certainty the timing of the resolution of this matter. Although the final resolution of this matter remains uncertain, we continue to believe that it is more likely than not our tax position will be sustained. However, an unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. Various countries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax and where enacted, the rules began to be effective for us in fiscal 2025. The Pillar Two rules are considered an alternative minimum tax and therefore deferred taxes would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated effects of the future minimum tax. The adoption and effective dates of these rules may vary by country and could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. There was no material impact from these tax law changes in fiscal 2025.

Table of Contents
On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was enacted in the U.S. The OBBBA includes significant provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, modifications to the international tax framework, and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through 2027. The majority of these changes take effect after our fiscal 2025 tax year. Those that did have an effect on our fiscal 2025, such as 100% bonus reinstatement, have been calculated and included in our provision for income taxes. There was no material impact from the OBBBA to fiscal 2025 financial statements.

Key Working Capital Management Measures
Management regularly reviews financial and non-financial performance indicators to assess our operating results. Our working capital requirements are dependent on the effective management of our sales cycle, as well as timing of payments. We believe the metrics set forth below are useful to investors in measuring our liquidity, as future liquidity needs will depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, contract assets, customer inventory advances, accounts receivable and accounts payable.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we changed the methodology for calculating key working capital management measures to standardize the number of days utilized in calculating the metrics, add a new metric for customer inventory advances days, and update the calculation of inventory turns to present inventory turns net of customer inventory advances, which is consistent with how we manage working capital. Prior period amounts have been conformed to the current period presentation.

(1)    Days in accounts receivable (a measure of how quickly we collect our accounts receivable), or “DSO”, is calculated as accounts receivable, net, at the end of the current quarter divided by net sales for the quarter multiplied by 90 days.
(2)    Contract asset days (a measure of how quickly we transfer contract assets to accounts receivable) is calculated as contract assets at the end of the current quarter divided by net sales for the quarter multiplied by 90 days.     
(3)    Days in inventory (a measure of how quickly we turn inventory into sales) is calculated as inventory at the end of the current quarter divided by cost of sales for the quarter multiplied by 90 days.
(4)    Accounts payable days (a measure of how quickly we pay our suppliers), or “DPO”, is calculated as accounts payable at the end of the current quarter divided by cost of sales for the quarter multiplied by 90 days.

(5)    Customer inventory advances days (a measure of how long customer deposits for inventory are held) is calculated as customer inventory advances at the end of the current quarter divided by cost of sales for the quarter multiplied by 90 days.
(6)    Cash cycle days is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable, contract asset days and days in inventory, minus the sum of accounts payable days and customer inventory advances days.
(7)    Net inventory turns (annualized) is calculated as 360 days divided by the days in inventory minus customer inventory advances days. 
Cash and cash equivalents were $926 million at September 27, 2025 and $626 million at September 28, 2024. Our cash levels vary during any given period depending on the timing of collections from customers and payments to suppliers, borrowings under credit facilities, sales of accounts receivable under numerous programs we utilize, repurchases of capital stock and other factors. Our working capital was approximately $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $621 million, $340 million and $235 million for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our working capital metrics tend to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on factors such as the linearity of our shipments to customers and purchases from suppliers, customer and supplier mix, the extent to which we factor customer receivables and the negotiation of payment terms with customers and suppliers. These fluctuations can significantly affect our cash flows from operating activities.
During 2025, we generated $432 million of cash from earnings, excluding non-cash items, and generated $189 million of cash primarily because of increases in accounts payable of $99 million, accrued liabilities and other of $75 million and deferred revenue and customer advances of $663 million, partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of $64 million, contract assets of $42 million and inventories of $543 million. These increases were consistent with the growth in business volume. The change in deferred revenue and customer advances is driven by increased customer deposits against raw material inventory purchases. During the third quarter of 2025, we initiated a program change with our customers that resulted in all inventory advance payments from customers to offset our working capital investment in raw materials inventory to be classified as deferred revenue and customer advances.
During 2024, we generated $447 million of cash from earnings, excluding non-cash items, and used $107 million of
cash primarily because of a decrease in accounts payable of $112 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $104 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue and customer advances of $89 million. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily attributable to an unfavorable mix of supplier payment terms and lower inventory receipts. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to unfavorable customer payment terms mix. The change in deferred revenue and customer advances is driven by increased customer deposits against raw material inventory purchases.
Net cash used in investing activities was $108 million, $114 million and $192 million for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In 2025, we received $49 million from the liquidation of investments held in a former rabbi trust for our deferred compensation plan assets, purchased $15 million of long-term investments and used $147 million of cash for capital expenditures. In 2024, we used $111 million of cash for capital expenditures.

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(174) million, $(270) million and $95 million for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In 2025, we repurchased $114 million of common stock, paid $43 million in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations and repaid an aggregate of $18 million of long-term debt. In 2024, we repurchased $228 million of common stock, paid $26 million in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations and repaid an aggregate of $22 million of long-term debt.
Existing Credit Facility. 
The Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2022, as amended, (the “Existing Credit Agreement”), provides for an $800 million revolving credit facility and a $350 million secured term loan (the “Term Loan Due 2027”), together with an accordion feature by which we can obtain, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions and commitment of the lenders, additional revolving commitments in an aggregate amount of up to $200 million. On June 6, 2025, we amended the Existing Credit Agreement to permit the ZT Acquisition. In connection with the closing of the ZT Acquisition, borrowings under the Credit Facilities (as defined below) were used to repay in full the amount remaining under the Term Loan Due 2027, and the Existing Credit Agreement was terminated.

Bridge Loan Facility
. On May 18, 2025, in connection with the acquisition of ZT Acquisition, we entered into a commitment letter with certain financial institutions that have agreed to provide us with, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions and covenants, a senior secured 364-day bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $2.5 billion (the “Bridge Loan Facility”) to fund a portion of the purchase consideration and to pay related fees and expenses. The commitment was intended to be drawn only to the extent that permanent financing was not obtained prior to closing the ZT Acquisition. On July 30, 2025, the Bridge Loan Facility was reduced from $2.5 billion to $800 million upon the Company entering into the New Credit Agreement (as defined below) and subsequently on the Closing Date, it was terminated in entirety.
New Credit Facility.
 On July 29, 2025, we entered into a credit agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) that provided for senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $3.5 billion (the “Credit Facilities”), consisting of a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a $2.0 billion term loan A facility. As of September 27, 2025, the commitments under the New Credit Agreement were completely unfunded, and the Existing Credit Agreement remained in effect until the Credit Facilities were drawn at the closing of the ZT Acquisition, as described below. 
 On October 20, 2025, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the New Credit Agreement to permit and finance the ZT Acquisition, including adding necessary definitions, funding conditions, and providing a delayed draw term loan A of $600 million with same terms and conditions as the Credit Facilities. See Note 6 “Debt” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for details. 
Subsequent to the year ended September 27, 2025, we completed the acquisition of ZT Systems on the Closing Date for a purchase consideration of $1.6 billion (subject to adjustment for certain working capital and other items) consisting of $1.46 billion in cash consideration and a number of shares of our common stock valued at $150 million (at $130.32 market value representing 1.2 million shares). Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, the seller is also entitled up to $450 million in contingent cash consideration upon the achievement of certain financial metrics during the three-year period following the Closing Date. To finance the cash portion of the acquisition and to settle all outstanding amounts under our Existing Credit Agreement, we simultaneously amended our Credit Facilities. The amendment included a new $800 million term loan B facility. At the Closing Date, we drew $1.4 billion under the term loan A facility and the full $800 million under the term loan B facility. Concurrently, with closing, the Bridge Commitment letter was terminated in its entirety. See Note 6 and Note 16 of “Debt” and “Business Combination”, respectively, of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for details. In addition, we entered into forward interest rate swap agreements with independent counterparties with an aggregate notional amount of $1.2 billion and a maturity date of October 31, 2030, effectively convert a portion of our variable interest rate obligations under the Credit Facilities to fixed interest rate obligations.
As of September 27, 2025, no borrowings and $9 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement, under which $791 million was available to borrow. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement as of September 28, 2024.
Short-term Borrowing Facilities.
 We had no short-term borrowings outstanding as of September 27, 2025. Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries had a total of $71 million of uncommitted short-term borrowing facilities available, under which no borrowings were outstanding as of September 27, 2025. Some of these facilities expire at various dates through the first quarter of 2027 and are expected to be renewed.
Other Liquidity Matters
During 2025, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $114 million (including commissions), under stock repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. These programs have no expiration dates and the timing of repurchases will depend upon capital needs to support the growth of our business, market conditions and other factors. Although stock repurchases are intended to increase stockholder value, purchases of shares reduce our liquidity. As a result, the timing of future repurchases depends upon our future capital needs, market conditions and other factors. As of September 27, 2025, an aggregate of $239 million remains available under the stock repurchase program.
We are party to a Receivables Purchase Agreement, as amended (the “RPA”), with certain third-party banking institutions for the sale of trade receivables generated from sales to certain customers. The amount available under the RPA is uncommitted and, as such, is available at the discretion of our third-party banking institutions. Under the Existing Credit Agreement, the percentage of our total trade receivables that can be sold and outstanding at any time is 50%. Therefore, as of September 27, 2025, a maximum of $490 million of sold receivables could be outstanding at any point in time under this program, as amended, as required by our Credit Agreement. Trade receivables sold pursuant to the RPA are serviced by us. 
In addition to the RPA, we participate in trade receivables sales programs that have been implemented by certain of our customers, as in effect from time to time. We do not service trade receivables sold under these other programs. The sale of 
41
Table of Contents
receivables under all of these programs is subject to the approval of the banks or customers involved and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell the maximum amount of receivables permitted by these programs when desired. See Note 8, “Accounts Receivable Sale Programs” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for details.
We enter into forward interest rate swap agreements with independent counterparties to partially hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate benchmark interest rate associated with anticipated variable rate borrowings. In addition, in the second quarter of 2025, we entered into a TRS contract to manage the equity market risks associated with our deferred compensation plan liabilities. See Note 5 “Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for details.
In the ordinary course of business, we are or may become party to legal proceedings, claims and other contingencies, including environmental, regulatory, warranty and employee matters and examinations by government agencies. As of September 27, 2025, we had accrued liabilities of $39 million related to such matters. We cannot accurately predict the outcome of these matters or the amount or timing of cash flows that may be required to defend ourselves or to settle such matters or that these reserves will be sufficient to fully satisfy our contingent liabilities.  
As of September 27, 2025, we had a liability of $53 million for uncertain tax positions. Our estimate of liabilities for uncertain tax positions is based on a number of subjective assessments, including the likelihood of a tax obligation being assessed, the amount of taxes (including interest and penalties) that would ultimately be payable, and our ability to settle any such obligations on favorable terms. Therefore, the amount of future cash flows associated with uncertain tax positions may be significantly higher or lower than our recorded liability and we are unable to reliably estimate when cash settlement may occur. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by approximately $8 million due to payments, the resolution of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations. In addition, there could be a corresponding decrease in accrued interest and penalties of approximately $2 million. 

Our liquidity is largely dependent on changes in our working capital, including sales of accounts receivable under our receivables sales programs and the extension of trade credit by our suppliers, investments in manufacturing inventory, facilities and equipment, repayments of obligations under outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of common stock. In 2025, we generated $621 million of cash from operations. Our primary sources of liquidity as of September 27, 2025 consisted of (1) cash and cash equivalents of $926 million (an aggregate of $215 million of our cash is held by Sanmina SCI India Private Limited (“SIPL”) and Sanmina SCI Technology India Private Limited, our existing Indian manufacturing entity, which is designated to fund its operations use); (2) our Existing Credit Agreement, under which $791 million, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, was available; (3) our foreign short-term borrowing facilities of $71 million, all of which was available; (4) proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable under our receivables sales programs; and (5) cash generated from operations. Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from existing and/or new lenders, we may increase the revolving commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement up to an additional $200 million.

We believe our existing cash resources and other sources of liquidity, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements through at least the next twelve months. However, should demand for our services decrease significantly over the next twelve months, should we be unable to recover on inventory obligations owed to us by our customers or should we experience significant increases in delinquent or uncollectible accounts receivable for any reason, our cash provided by operations could decrease significantly and we could be required to seek additional sources of liquidity to continue our operations at their current level.
We invest our cash among a number of financial institutions that we believe to be of high quality. However, there can be no assurance that one or more of such institutions will not become insolvent in the future, in which case all or a portion of our uninsured funds on deposit with such institutions could be lost.
As of September 27, 2025, 42% of our cash balance was held in the United States. Should we choose or need to remit cash to the United States from our foreign locations, we may incur tax obligations which would reduce the amount of cash ultimately available to the United States. We believe that cash held in the United States, together with liquidity available under our Existing Credit Agreement and cash from foreign subsidiaries that could be remitted to the United States without tax consequences, will be sufficient to meet our United States liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.
Contractual Obligations

As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments. These obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. As of September 27, 2025, our estimated future obligations consist of leases, our Term Loan Due 2027, pension plan funding obligations and unrecognized tax benefits.

A summary of our operating lease obligations as of September 27, 2025 can be found in Note 7 “Leases” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.
A summary of our long-term debt obligations as of September 27, 2025 can be found in Note 6 “Debt” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. 
We have defined benefit pension plans with an underfunded amount of $46 million as of September 27, 2025. We will be required to provide additional funding to these plans in the future if our returns on plan assets are not sufficient to meet our funding obligations. See Note 15 “Employee Benefit Plans” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.
Our long-term liabilities arising from unrecognized tax benefits can be found in Note 10 “Income Tax” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.
We also have outstanding firm purchase orders with certain suppliers for the purchase of inventory which are generally short-term in nature. Orders for standard, or catalog, items can typically be canceled with little or no financial penalty. Our policy regarding non-standard or customized items dictates that such items are only ordered specifically for customers who have contractually assumed liability for the inventory, although exceptions are made to this policy in certain situations. Accordingly, our liability from purchase obligations under these purchase orders is not expected to be significant. Lastly, pursuant to arrangements under which vendors consign inventory to us, we may be required to purchase such inventory after a certain period of time. To date, we have not been required to purchase a significant amount of inventory pursuant to these time limitations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of September 27, 2025, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Our primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates as of September 27, 2025 relates to our Term Loan Due 2027, under which $302 million is currently outstanding, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, for which the interest rate we pay is based on a floating index. As of September 27, 2025, we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million that effectively convert our floating rate Term Loan Due 2027 to a fixed rate term loan. An immediate 10 percent change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations. For more information about our debt and derivative instruments, see Note 5 “Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk” and Note 6 “Debt” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Market Risk
We entered into a TRS during the second quarter of 2025 to substantially offset changes in the deferred compensation plan liabilities resulting from changes in the value of investment elections made by participants. Under the terms of the agreement, we make periodic payments at a floating rate, SOFR plus a spread, on the notional value of the swap. See Note 5 “Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for further details.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We transact business in foreign currencies. Our foreign exchange policy requires that we take certain steps to limit our foreign exchange exposures resulting from certain assets and liabilities and forecasted cash flows. However, our policy does not require us to hedge all foreign exchange exposures. Furthermore, our foreign currency hedges are based on forecasted transactions and estimated balances, the amount of which may differ from that actually incurred. As a result, we can experience foreign exchange gains and losses in our results of operations.

We enter into short-term foreign currency forward contracts to hedge currency exposures associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies such as Indian rupee, Mexican peso and Chinese renminbi. These contracts generally have maturities of up to two months and these forward contracts are not designated as part of a hedging relationship for accounting purposes. Accordingly, all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked-to-market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of income. From an economic perspective, the objective of our hedging program is for gains or losses on forward contracts to substantially offset gains and losses on the underlying hedged items. As of September 27, 2025, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts to exchange various foreign currencies for U.S. dollars in an aggregate notional amount of $491 million. 
We also utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain operational (“cash flow”) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from (1) forecasted non-functional currency sales and (2) forecasted non-functional currency materials, labor, overhead and other expenses. These contracts may be up to twelve months in duration and are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the contracts is recorded in stockholders’ equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. We had forward contracts related to cash flow hedges in various foreign currencies in an aggregate notional amount of $131 million as of September 27, 2025. 
The net impact of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates would not be material to our consolidated financial statements, provided we accurately forecast and estimate our foreign currency exposure. If such forecasts are materially inaccurate, we could incur significant gains or losses.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Sanmina Corporation 
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sanmina Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2025, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated

financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024
, 
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2025

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A
.
 Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated

financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated

financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition using the Cost-to-cost Method for Government Contracts in the Defense and Aerospace Division
As described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues for the CPS segment were $1.6 billion for the year ended September 27, 2025, of which the defense and aerospace division represents a portion of the segment. In the defense and aerospace division, management applies the cost-to-cost method for government contracts which requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs included in the total estimated costs at completion. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition using the cost-to-cost method for government contracts in the defense and aerospace division is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the total estimated costs at completion and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating management‘s significant assumptions related to estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs. Also as disclosed by management, material weaknesses existed during the year related to this matter.  
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the cost-to-cost method for government contracts in the defense and aerospace division. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the total estimated costs at completion for a sample of defense and aerospace government contracts; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management in developing the total estimated costs; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to the estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs involved (i) assessing management’s ability to reasonably estimate costs for government contracts by assessing the nature and status of government contracts; (ii) performing retrospective reviews of government contract estimates and changes in estimates over time; and (iii) obtaining evidence to support total estimated costs at completion.

SANMINA CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. 
Organization of Sanmina 

Sanmina Corporation (“Sanmina,” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware in 1989. The Company is a leading global provider of integrated manufacturing solutions, components, products and repair, logistics and after-market services. The Company provides these comprehensive solutions primarily to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that serve the industrial, medical, defense and aerospace, automotive, communications networks and cloud infrastructure industries.
The Company’s operations are managed as two businesses:  
1)
Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (“IMS”). IMS is a single operating segment consisting of printed circuit board (“PCB”) assembly and test, high-level assembly and test and direct-order-fulfillment.
2)
Components, Products and Services (“CPS”). Components include advanced PCBs, backplanes and backplane assemblies, cable assemblies, fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts. Products include optical, radio frequency (“RF”) and microelectronic design and manufacturing services from the Company’s Advanced Microsystems Technologies division; multi-chip package memory solutions from the Company’s Viking Technology division; high-performance storage platforms for hyperscale and enterprise solutions from the Company’s Viking Enterprise Solutions division; defense and aerospace products, design, manufacturing, repair and refurbishment services from the Company’s SCI Technology, Inc. (“SCI”) subsidiary; and cloud-based smart manufacturing execution software from the Company’s 42Q division. Services include design, engineering, and logistics and repair. 
The Company has 
one
 reportable segment, IMS, for financial reporting purposes which represented approximately 
80
% of total revenue in 2025. The Company’s CPS business consists of multiple operating segments which do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for being presented as reportable segments. Therefore, financial information for these operating segments is combined and presented in a single category called “CPS”. The accounting policies for each segment are the same as those disclosed by the Company for its consolidated financial statements. 

Basis of Presentation
Fiscal Year.
 The Company operates on a 52 or 53 week year ending on the Saturday nearest September 30. Fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 were each a 52 week year. All references to years relate to fiscal years unless otherwise noted.

Principles of Consolidation.
 The consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All intra-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Noncontrolling interest represents a noncontrolling investor’s interest in the results of operations of subsidiaries that the Company controls and consolidates.
Reclassification. 
Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, the Company changed the presentation of deferred revenue and customer advances, which were previously included within accrued liabilities, to be a separate line item on the consolidated balance sheets. Similarly, a separate line for the change in those amounts is presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.

Note 2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Management Estimates and Uncertainties.
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company has considered information available to it as of the date of issuance of these financial statements and is not aware of any specific events or circumstances that would require an update to its estimates or judgments, or a revision to the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements relate to provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, environmental matters, and legal exposures; determining liabilities for uncertain tax positions; determining the realizability of deferred tax assets; determining fair values of tangible and intangible assets for purposes of 
52
Table of Contents
impairment tests; and estimating costs expected to be incurred to satisfy performance obligations under long-term contracts and variable consideration related to such contracts. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

Noncontrolling Interest. 
In 2023, the Company entered into a joint venture transaction pursuant to which RSBVL acquired 
50.1
% of the outstanding shares of Sanmina SCI India Private Limited (“SIPL”), the Company’s existing Indian manufacturing entity for $
216
 million of cash. The remaining 
49.9
% is held by the Company. In accordance with ASC Topic 810, 
Consolidation 
(“ASC 810”), the Company is required to consolidate entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. The Company determined the voting interest model was applicable under ASC 810 and concluded that, despite not having a majority ownership interest, the Company has a controlling financial interest in SIPL through the management services contract. Therefore, the Company has, by contract, the unilateral ability to control the significant decisions made in the ordinary course of SIPL’s business. Because the Company has a controlling financial interest in SIPL, it consolidates SIPL. However, the Company periodically assesses whether any changes in facts and circumstances have occurred that could require the Company to deconsolidate SIPL.
As of September 27, 2025, an aggregate of $
215
 million of cash and cash equivalents of SIPL’s and Sanmina SCI Technology India Private Limited, the Company’s existing Indian manufacturing entity, is designated to fund its operations use.
Financial Instruments.
 Financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements, a total return swap contract (“TRS”), accounts payable and debt obligations. The fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 due to the nature or short maturity of these instruments, or because, in some cases, the instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and investments in highly liquid debt instruments with initial maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash equivalents are funds that are contractually restricted and invested in money market funds, solely for distribution to participants of the deferred compensation plan.

Accounts Receivable and Other Related Allowances.
 The Company had allowances of approximately $
8
 million and $
7
 million as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively, for uncollectible accounts, product returns and other net sales adjustments. To establish the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company estimates credit risk associated with accounts receivable by considering the creditworthiness of its customers, past experience, specific facts and circumstances, and the overall economic climate in industries that it serves. To establish the allowance for product returns and other adjustments, the Company primarily utilizes historical data.

Accounts Receivable Sales.
 The Company is a party to a Receivables Purchase Agreement (the “RPA”) with certain third-party banking institutions for the sale of trade receivables generated from sales to certain customers, subject to acceptance by, and a funding commitment from, the banks that are party to the RPA. Trade receivables sold pursuant to the RPA are serviced by the Company.
In addition to the RPA, the Company has the option to participate in trade receivables sales programs that have been implemented by certain of the Company’s customers, as in effect from time to time. The Company does not service trade receivables sold under these other programs. Under each of the programs noted above, the Company sells its entire interest in a trade receivable for 100% of face value, less a discount. Upon sale, these receivables are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and the cash received is presented as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Inventories.
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (based on standard cost, which approximates first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Cost includes labor, materials and manufacturing overhead.

Provisions are made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. The ultimate realization of inventory carrying amounts is primarily affected by changes in customer demand. Inventory provisions are established based on forecasted demand, past experience with specific customers, the age and nature of the inventory, the ability to redistribute inventory to other programs or back to suppliers and whether customers are contractually obligated and have the ability to pay for the related inventory. The Company’s raw materials inventories are generally acquired in anticipation of specific customer orders and pursuant to customer-specific design specifications. When the Company and its customers agree that the quantity of customer-specific inventory is in excess of anticipated demand, the Company may seek advance payments from its customers against such inventories. These advances are presented under deferred revenue and customer advances on 
53
Table of Contents
the consolidated balance sheets. In the past, in some arrangements with some customers, the Company transferred control of excess inventories to its customers in exchange for a cash payment, which resulted in a derecognition of the inventory. Those transactions were reported as transfers of non-financial assets – i.e., reported on a net basis in the income statement – and not included in revenue.
Long-lived Assets.
 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or, in the case of property and equipment acquired through business combinations, at fair value as of the acquisition date. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over 
20
 to 
40
 years for buildings and 
3
 to 
15
 years for machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the asset.  

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An asset group is the unit of accounting which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. An asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. For asset groups for which the primary asset is a building, the Company estimates fair value based on data provided by commercial real estate brokers. For other asset groups, the Company estimates fair value based on projected discounted future net cash flows.

Foreign Currency Translation.
 For foreign subsidiaries using the local currency as their functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. The effects of these translation adjustments are reported in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). For all entities, remeasurement adjustments for non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from long-term intercompany loans denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency are recorded in AOCI if repayment of the loan is not anticipated in the foreseeable future.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
 The Company conducts business on a global basis in numerous currencies. In addition, the Company has a deferred compensation plan liability and certain of its outstanding debt has a variable interest rate. Therefore, the Company is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and market volatility. The Company uses derivatives, such as foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements and TRS, to minimize the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 

The Company accounts for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with ASC Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, which requires each derivative instrument to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value as either an asset or a liability. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the Company excludes the change in the fair value of the contract related to the changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward price from its assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes these amounts, which are primarily related to time value, in earnings over the life of the derivative instrument. Gains or losses on the derivative not caused by changes in time value are recorded in AOCI, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Derivative instruments are entered into for periods of time consistent with the related underlying exposures and are not entered into for speculative purposes. At the inception of a hedge, the Company documents all relationships between derivative instruments and related hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategies for the hedging transaction.

Leases. 
The Company’s leases consist of operating leases for buildings and land and have initial lease terms of up to 
44
 years. Certain of these leases contain an option to extend the lease term for additional periods or to terminate the lease after an initial non-cancelable term. Renewal options are considered in the measurement of the Company’s initial lease liability and corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset only if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. Leases with a term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the Company’s balance sheet.
The Company’s lease liability and ROU assets represent the present value of future fixed lease payments which are a combination of lease components and non-lease components such as maintenance and utilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of the Company’s lease payments are variable because such payments adjust periodically based on changes in consumer price and other indexes. Variable payments are expensed as incurred and not included in the measurement of lease liabilities and ROU assets. Since the Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease 
54
Table of Contents
commencement date for purposes of determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is based on the term of the lease, the economic environment of the lease and the effect of collateralization, if any.
Revenue Recognition.
 The Company derives revenue principally from sales of integrated manufacturing solutions, components and Company-proprietary products. Other sources of revenue include logistics and repair services; design, development and engineering services; defense and aerospace programs; and sales of raw materials to customers whose requirements change after the Company has procured inventory to fulfill the customer’s forecasted demand.
The Company determines the appropriate revenue to recognize as described in ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(“ASC 606”) by applying a 5-step model: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Each of these steps may involve the use of significant judgments, as discussed below.
Step 1 - Identify the contract with a customer
The Company generally enters into a master supply agreement (“MSA”) with its customers that provides the framework under which business will be conducted, and pursuant to which a customer will issue purchase orders or other binding documents to specify the quantity, price and delivery requirements for products or services the customer wishes to purchase. The Company generally considers its contract with a customer to be a firm commitment, consisting of the combination of an MSA and a purchase order or any other similar binding document.
Step 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract
A performance obligation is a promised good or service that is material in the context of the contract and is both capable of being distinct (customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources) and distinct within the context of the contract (separately identifiable from other promises). The Company reviews its contracts to identify promised goods or services and then evaluates such items to determine which of those items are performance obligations. The majority of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation since the promise to transfer an individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company’s performance obligations generally have an expected duration of one year or less.
Step 3 - Determine the transaction price
Contracts with customers may include certain forms of variable consideration such as early payment discounts, volume discounts and shared cost savings. The Company includes an estimate of variable consideration when determining the transaction price and the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized. This estimate is limited to an amount which will not result in a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. Factors considered in the Company’s estimate of variable consideration are the potential amount subject to these contract provisions, historical experience and other relevant facts and circumstances. 
Step 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. In the event that more than one performance obligation is identified in a contract, a portion of the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation. This allocation would generally be based on the relative standalone price of each performance obligation, which most often would represent the price at which the Company would sell similar goods or services separately.
S
tep 5 - Recognize revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied
The Company is required to assess whether control of a product or services promised under a contract is transferred to the customer at a point-in-time or over time as the product is being manufactured or the services are being provided. If the criteria in ASC 606, for recognizing revenue on an over time basis are not met, revenue must be recognized at the point-in-time determined by the Company at which its customer obtains control of a product or service.
The Company recognizes revenue for the majority of its contracts on an over time basis. This is primarily due to the fact that the Company does not have an alternative use for the end products it manufactures for its customers and has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit, for work in progress upon a customer’s cancellation of a contract 
55
Table of Contents
for convenience. In certain circumstances, the Company recognizes over time because its customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company’s services or the Company’s customer controls the end product as the Company performs manufacturing services (continuous transfer of control). At least 
95
% of the Company’s revenue is recognized on an over time basis, which is as products are manufactured or services are performed. Because of this, and the fact that there is no work in process or finished goods inventory associated with contracts for which revenue is recognized on an over-time basis, 
99
% or more of the Company’s inventory at the end of a given period is in the form of raw materials. For contracts for which revenue is required to be recognized at a point in time, the Company recognizes revenue when it has transferred control of the related goods, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of the goods to the customer. 
In the Defense and Aerospace division, the Company applies the cost-to-cost method for government contracts which requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs included in the total estimated costs at completion. Additionally, the Company evaluates whether contract modifications for claims have been approved and, if so, estimates the amount, if any, of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price of the contract.
Estimates of materials, labor and subcontractor costs expected to be incurred to satisfy a performance obligation are updated on a quarterly basis. These estimates consider costs incurred to date and estimated costs to be incurred over the remaining expected period of performance to satisfy a performance obligation. There is inherent uncertainty in estimating the amount of costs that will be required to complete a contract. Factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in estimates include, among others, (1) the long-term duration of contracts, (2) the highly-complex nature of the products the Company manufactures, (3) the readiness of our customer’s design for manufacturing, (4) the cost and availability of purchased materials, (5) labor cost, availability and productivity, (6) subcontractor performance and (7) the risk of delayed performance/completion. Therefore, such estimates are reviewed each quarter by a group of employees that includes representatives from numerous functions such as engineering, materials, contracts, manufacturing, program management, finance and senior management. If a change in estimate is deemed necessary, the impact of the change is recognized in the period of change. Additionally, contract modifications for claims are assessed each quarter to determine whether the claims have been approved. If it is determined that a claim has been approved, the amount of the claim, if any, that can be included in transaction price is estimated considering a number of factors such as the length of time expected to lapse until uncertainty about the claim has been resolved and the extent to which our experience with claims for similar contracts has predictive value.
Contract Assets
A contract asset is recognized when the Company has recognized revenue, but has not issued an invoice to its customer for payment. Contract assets are classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets and transferred to accounts receivable when rights to payment become unconditional. Because of the Company’s short manufacturing cycle times, the transfer from contract assets to accounts receivable generally occurs within the next fiscal quarter.
Other
Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control of a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales.
The Company applies the following practical expedients or policy elections under ASC 606:
•
The promised amount of consideration under a contract is not adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component because, at inception of a contract, the Company expects the period between when a good or service is transferred to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will generally be one year or less.
•
The Company has elected to not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less, which is substantially all of the Company’s remaining performance obligations.
•
Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are not capitalized if the period over which such costs would be amortized to expense is less than one year.

Stock-based Compensation
. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which generally ranges from 
one year
 to 
four years
 and/or upon achievement of specified performance criteria. Stock-based compensation expense for time-based and performance-based 
56
Table of Contents
restricted stock awards is valued at the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. During the requisite service period, performance-based restricted stock awards are monitored by management for probability of achievement of performance goals and if it becomes probable that the number of awarded shares that will vest is greater than or less than the previous estimate of the number of awarded shares that will vest, an adjustment to stock-based compensation expense will be recognized as a change in accounting estimate. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for market-based restricted stock units measured at fair value on the grant date using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The stock-based compensation expense for awards with market conditions will be recognized over the requisite service periods regardless of whether the market conditions are satisfied.
Income taxes.
 The Company estimates its income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates, including estimating exposures and making judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The carrying value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is based on the Company’s belief that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria discussed above
.
The Company’s tax rate is dependent upon the geographic distribution of its worldwide income or losses, the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region, the availability of tax credits and carryforwards, including net operating losses, and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies.

The Company makes an assessment of whether each income tax position is “more likely than not” of being sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation, if any. For each income tax position that meets the “more likely than not” recognition threshold, the Company then assesses the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon effective settlement with the tax authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.

Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk
Fair Value Measurements
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair values of cash equivalents (representing 
21
% of cash and cash equivalents), restricted cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate carrying value due to the short-term duration of these instruments. Additionally, the fair value of variable rate long-term debt approximates carrying value as of September 27, 2025. The Company’s cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The Company’s deferred compensation plan and defined benefit plan assets are measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs on a recurring basis. See Note 15 “Employee Benefit Plans” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for details on defined benefit plan assets. In 2025, the Company liquidated $
49
 million of investments held in a former rabbi trust for its deferred compensation plan assets. These funds were reinvested in other types of investments as of September 27, 2025, with $
40
 million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets as restricted cash equivalent and $
10
 million recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As of September 28, 2024, assets associated with the deferred compensation plan were $
47
 million and recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plan were $
54
 million and $
47
 million as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively, and recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company also measures fair value of foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swap agreements and TRS on a recurring basis. Interest rate swaps are valued based on a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates observable market inputs such as interest rate yield curves and credit spreads. The TRS is measured at fair value using quoted prices of the underlying investments. For currency contracts, inputs include foreign currency spot and forward rates and interest rates at commonly quoted intervals. 
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Other non-financial assets, such as goodwill and other long-lived assets, are measured at fair value as of the date such assets are acquired or in the period an impairment is recorded. 
Offsetting Derivative Assets and Liabilities
The Company has entered into master netting arrangements with each of its derivative counterparties that allows net settlement of derivative assets and liabilities under certain conditions, such as multiple transactions with the same currency maturing on the same date. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
The Company is exposed to certain risks related to its ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed by using derivative instruments is foreign currency exchange risk.
Forward contracts on various foreign currencies are used to manage foreign currency risk associated with forecasted foreign currency transactions and certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. The Company’s primary foreign currency cash flows are in India, Mexico and China.
The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain operational (“cash flow”) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures generally result from (1) forecasted non-functional currency sales and (2) forecasted non-functional currency materials, labor, overhead and other expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are generally one to two months in duration but, by policy, may be up to 
twelve months
 in duration. The amount of gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income on derivative instruments and the amount of gain or loss reclassified from AOCI into income were not material for any period presented herein and is included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income.
The Company enters into short-term foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. These contracts have maturities of up to 
two months
 and are not designated as accounting hedges. Accordingly, these contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each period with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of income. The amount of gains or losses associated with these forward contracts was not material for any period presented herein. From an economic perspective, the objective of the Company’s hedging program is for gains and losses on forward contracts to substantially offset gains and losses on the underlying hedged items. In addition to the contracts disclosed in the table above, the Company has numerous contracts that have been closed from an economic and financial accounting perspective and will settle early in the first month of the following quarter. Since these offsetting contracts do not expose the Company to risk of fluctuations in exchange rates, these contracts have been excluded from the above table.
62
Table of Contents
Interest Rate Swaps
The Company enters into forward interest rate swap agreements with independent counterparties to partially hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in Secured Overnight Financing Rate benchmark interest rate (“SOFR”) associated with anticipated variable rate borrowings. These interest rate swaps have a maturity date of 
September 27, 2027
 and effectively convert a portion of the Company’s variable interest rate obligations to fixed interest rate obligations. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges under ASC Topic 815,
 Derivatives and Hedging
. The aggregate effective interest rate of these swaps as of September 27, 2025 was approximately 
4.7
%. 
Subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2025, the Company entered into forward interest rate swap agreements with independent counterparties with an aggregate notional amount of $
1.2
 billion and a maturity date of 
October 31, 2030
, effectively convert a portion of the Company’s variable interest rate obligations under the Credit Facilities to fixed interest rate obligations.
Total Return Swap
In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company entered into a TRS to substantially offset changes in the deferred compensation plan liabilities resulting from changes in the value of investment elections made by participants. The Company elected not to designate the TRS as an accounting hedge and recognized the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash equivalents with recognized financial institutions, both domestic and foreign. Cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash equivalents may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits, but may generally be redeemed upon demand. Periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions are performed and the Company attempts to limit its exposure with any one institution. One of the Company’s most significant credit risks is the ultimate realization of accounts receivable. This risk is mitigated by ongoing credit evaluations of, and frequent contact with, the Company’s customers, especially its most significant customers, thus enabling it to monitor changes in business operations and respond accordingly. The Company generally does not require collateral for sales on credit. The Company considers these concentrations of credit risks when estimating its allowance for doubtful accounts. Foreign currency forward contracts, TRS and interest rate swaps are maintained with high quality counterparties to reduce the Company’s credit risk and are recorded on the Company’s balance sheets at fair value.
Two customers represented 
10
% or more of the Company’s gross accounts receivable as of September 27, 2025. One customer represented 
10
% or more of the Company’s gross accounts receivable as of September 28, 2024.

Credit Facilities
Existing Credit Agreement
On 
September 27, 2022
, the Company entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Existing Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $
800
 million revolving credit facility and a $
350
 million secured term loan (the “Term Loan Due 2027”). Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from existing and/or new lenders, the Company may increase the revolving commitment up to an additional $
200
 million. Costs incurred in connection with Existing Credit Agreement of $
3
 million are classified as long-term debt and are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the Term Loan Due 2027 using the effective interest method.
Loans under the Existing Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either the SOFR or a base rate, in each case plus a spread determined based on the Company’s credit rating. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to base rate loans and at the end of an interest period (and at three month intervals if the interest period exceeds three months) in the case of SOFR loans. The outstanding principal amount of all loans under the Existing Credit Agreement, including the Term Loan Due 2027, together with accrued and unpaid interest, is due on 
September 27, 2027
. The Company is required to repay a portion of the principal amount of the Term Loan Due 2027 equal to 
1.25
% of the principal in quarterly installments.
Certain of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries are guarantors in respect of the Existing Credit Agreement. The Company and the subsidiary guarantors’ obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of their respective assets (excluding real property), including cash, accounts receivable and the shares of certain Company subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.
On June 6, 2025, the Company amended the Existing Credit Agreement to permit the acquisition of ZT Group Int’l, Inc. (“ZT Systems”) from AMD Design, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. See Note 16 “Business Combination” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for details.
As of September 27, 2025, 
no
 borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $
9
 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement, under which $
791
 million was available to borrow.
Bridge Loan Facility
On 
May 18, 2025
, in connection with the acquisition of ZT Systems (the “ZT Acquisition”), the Company entered into a commitment letter with certain financial institutions that have agreed to provide the Company with, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions and covenants, a senior secured 364-day bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
2.5
 billion (the “Bridge Loan Facility”) to fund a portion of the purchase consideration and to pay related fees and expenses. The commitment was intended to be drawn only to the extent that permanent financing was not obtained prior to the closing the ZT Acquisition. 
On July 30, 2025, the Bridge Loan Facility was reduced from $
2.5
 billion to $
800
 million upon the Company entering into the New Credit Agreement (as defined below). As of September 27, 2025, $
24
 million of financing fees incurred in connection with the Bridge Loan Facility were recorded as acquisition and integration charges in the consolidated statements of income as the Bridge Loan Facility was not utilized and was terminated in its entirety upon the close of ZT acquisition.

Table of Contents
New Credit Agreement
On 
July 29, 2025
, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) that provided for senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate of $
3.5
 billion (the “Credit Facilities”), consisting of a $
1.5
 billion revolving credit facility and a $
2.0
 billion term loan A facility. As of September 27, 2025, the commitments under the New Credit Agreement were completely unfunded, and the Existing Credit Agreement remained in effect until the Credit Facilities were drawn at the closing of the ZT Acquisition, as described below. 
Borrowings under the Credit Facilities have a maturity date of five years from the date when the Credit Facilities will be initially drawn (the “Initial Funding Date”), subject to extension as provided in the New Credit Agreement and will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either a base or SOFR-based rate plus a margin that varies depending on the Company’s consolidated total net leverage ratio. The Company expects that, at the time of the Initial Funding Date, the applicable margin for base rate and term SOFR-based rate borrowing would be 
0.75
% and 
1.75
%, respectively. The Company is obligated to pay customary fees, including commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving facility and letter of credit fees. Additionally, the Company will pay a ticking fee at an annual rate of 
0.25
% on the aggregate amount of the unfunded commitments regardless of whether the Initial Funding Date occurs.
As of the Initial Funding Date, the obligations under the New Credit Agreement are secured by first-priority liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors, subject to certain exceptions and thresholds. The New Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, namely consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, in both cases measured on the basis of a trailing 12-month look-back period. In addition, the negative covenants limit the Company’s ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, make investments and other restricted payments, sell assets and pay dividends, subject to certain exceptions. The New Credit Agreement also includes covenants that require the Company to file quarterly and annual financial statements with the SEC on a timely basis.
Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the New Credit Agreement were $
5
 million as of September 27, 2025 and were recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 
Subsequent to the year ended September 27, 2025, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the New Credit Agreement on October 20, 2025 to permit and finance the ZT Acquisition, including adding necessary definitions, funding conditions, and providing a delayed draw term loan A of $
600
 million, which may be drawn by the Company in up to two separate drawings during the period commencing on the closing of the ZT Acquisition and ending on the one year anniversary of such closing.
On 
October 27, 2025
 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed the acquisition of ZT Systems for a purchase consideration of up to $
1.6
 billion (subject to adjustment for certain working capital and other items) consisting of $
1.46
 billion in cash consideration and a number of shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $
150
 million (at $
130.32
 market value representing 
1.2
 million shares). Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, the seller  is also entitled up to $
450
 million in contingent cash consideration upon the achievement of certain financial metrics during the three-year period following the Closing Date. See Note 16 “Business Combination” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for details. In addition, on 
October 27, 2025
, the Company executed an amendment to increase the Credit Facilities to include an $
800
 million term loan B facility. Borrowings under the term loan B facility bears interest, at the Company’s option, at either SOFR plus 
2.0
% or base rate plus 
1.0
%.
To finance the cash portion of the acquisition and to settle all outstanding amounts under the Company’s Existing Credit Agreement, the Company simultaneously drew $
1.4
 billion under the term loan A facility and the full $
800
 million under the term loan B facility. Concurrently on the Closing Date, the Existing Credit Agreement was fully repaid and the Bridge Loan Facility was terminated in its entirety. 
Short-term Borrowing Facilities 
Certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company had a total of $
71
 million of uncommitted short-term borrowing facilities available, under which 
no
 borrowings were outstanding as of September 27, 2025. Some of these facilities expire at various dates through 
the first quarter of 2027
 and are expected to be renewed.

Debt Covenants
The Existing Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, namely a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, in both cases measured on the basis of a trailing 12-month look-back period. In addition, the Company’s debt agreements contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, making investments and other restricted payments, selling assets and paying dividends, subject to certain exceptions. Finally, the agreements also include covenants that require us to file quarterly and annual financial statements with the SEC on a timely basis. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 27, 2025.

Contingencies
From time to time, the Company is a party to litigation, claims and other contingencies, including environmental, regulatory and employee matters and examinations and investigations by governmental agencies, which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with ASC Topic 450, 
Contingencies,
 or other applicable accounting standards. As of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had reserves of $
39
 million for environmental matters, warranty, 
67
Table of Contents
litigation and other contingencies (excluding reserves for uncertain tax positions), which the Company believes are adequate. However, there can be no assurance that the Company’s reserves will be sufficient to settle these contingencies. Such reserves are included in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
Legal Proceedings
Environmental Matters
The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and administrative orders concerning environmental protection, including those addressing the discharge of pollutants into the environment, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the materials used in products, and the recycling, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. 
In June 2008, the Company was named by the Orange County Water District in a suit alleging that a predecessor company’s actions at a plant the Company sold in 1998 contributed to polluted groundwater managed by the plaintiff. The complaint sought recovery of compensatory and other damages, as well as declaratory relief, for the payment of costs necessary to investigate, monitor, remediate, abate and contain contamination of groundwater. In April 2013, all claims against the Company were dismissed. The plaintiff appealed this dismissal and the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment in August 2017, remanding the case back to the Superior Court of California for trial. The trial against the Company and several other defendants commenced in April 2021 and the submission of evidence concluded in May 2022. On April 3, 2023, the court published a statement of decision finding the Company and other remaining defendants liable for certain past investigation costs incurred by the plaintiff. Subsequent proceedings to assess the Company’s and other defendants’ liability for the plaintiff’s future remediation and other costs, including attorneys’ fees, were expected. However, without admitting any liability, in August 2024, the Company and plaintiff agreed to settle this matter and all pending litigation in exchange for the Company’s payment to the plaintiff of $
3
 million, which amount was paid during the fiscal quarter ended December 28, 2024.
Item 103 of the SEC’s Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and the proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions unless the Company reasonably believes the monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, will not equal or exceed a threshold which the Company determines is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of any such proceeding that is material to its business or financial condition. Item 103 states that the disclosure threshold is $
300,000
, or at our election, a threshold that does not exceed the lesser of $
1
 million or one percent of our consolidated current assets. As permitted by Item 103, the Company has elected to adopt a quantitative threshold for environmental proceedings of $
1
 million. Given the size of its operations, the Company believes that environmental matters under this threshold are not material to its business or financial condition. 
On May 4, 2023, the Company received a summon to respond to a misdemeanor criminal complaint stemming from certain alleged violations of the California Health & Safety Code at the Company’s O’Toole Street plant in San Jose, California. The charging document (as amended), filed in the Superior Court for Santa Clara County, alleged: (a) improper releases of chlorine gas on four occasions, (b) improper and incomplete reporting of such releases, (c) improper treatment and storage of hazardous waste, and (d) improper assessment and record keeping regarding hazardous waste treatment system tanks. In December 2024, after fully addressing the issues raised in the action, the Company pled 
nolo contendre
 to three of the alleged counts (the government dismissed all other counts) and agreed to pay fines and penalty assessments totaling $
0.6
 million, which payment was made in March 2025.  
Other Matters
In December 2019, the Company sued a former customer, 
Dialight plc
 (“Dialight”), in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Court”) to collect unpaid accounts receivable and net obsolete inventory obligations (which, by the time of the September 2024 trial referenced below, totaled $
9
 million, exclusive of interest and attorneys’ fees). On the same day the Company filed its suit, Dialight commenced its own action in the same court. 
Dialight
 alleged that the Company fraudulently misrepresented its capabilities to induce Dialight to enter into a Manufacturing Services Agreement (“MSA”) and then allegedly committed multiple, willful breaches of contract when performing under the MSA. After a trial in September 2024, a jury awarded the Company the full $
9
 million on its claims, rejected Dialight’s claims for fraudulent inducement and willful breach of contract, and awarded Dialight $
1
 million for breach of contract (collectively, the “Verdict”). The parties filed post-trial motions in October 2024, including a motion by the Company for prejudgment interest and its costs and expenses of the suit, and a motion by Dialight for pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, its costs and expenses of the suit and for a new trial. Effective March 27, 2025, the parties entered into a Stipulation for Entry of Judgment and Conditional Covenant Not to Execute (the “Stipulation”), which resolved conclusively all pending claims and disputed issues through (i) a series of payments by Dialight to the Company over the next two years totaling $
12
 million, and (ii) Dialight’s assignment to Sanmina of the $
2
 million (including prejudgment interest) otherwise due Dialight from Sanmina’s 
68
Table of Contents
insurer in respect of the Verdict. On April 4, 2025, the Court entered a final judgment consistent with the Stipulation, marking the end of this litigation. On October 9, 2025, the Company and Dialight agreed to accelerate the payment schedule (final payment now is due December 31, 2025) and reduce the total amount due by $
350,000
.
In May 2023, the Company and its SCI Technology, Inc. subsidiary (“SCI”) received Civil Investigative Demands (“CIDs”) from the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) pursuant to the civil False Claims Act (“FCA”). The stated purpose of the CIDs—a form of subpoena requiring responses to written interrogatories and the production of documents relating to certain contracts, projects, proposals, and business activities of SCI going back to 2010—is to determine whether there is or has been a violation of the FCA with respect to the provision of products and services to the government. These CIDs supplemented several CIDs relating to the same subject matter served upon SCI and certain current and former SCI and Sanmina employees beginning in August 2020, pursuant to which SCI produced documents and information and certain of the current and former employees provided oral testimony. The Company and SCI cooperated with the DOJ investigation. On May 13, 2024, the Company learned that 
United States of America ex rel. Carl R. Eckert v. SCI Technology, Inc. et al. 
(the “Eckert Qui Tam Suit”) had been filed under seal by a former SCI employee in June 2020, and recently unsealed. On May 13, 2024, the Company also learned that the DOJ had filed a notice in the Eckert Qui Tam Suit stating that, while its investigation would continue, it was declining to intervene at the current time. As narrowed by a September 23, 2025 court order granting in part and denying in part the Company and SCI’s motion to dismiss, the Eckert Qui Tam Suit alleges on behalf of the United States 6 FCA counts that relate substantially to the same contracts and issues that the DOJ previously had investigated, including making false certifications under the Truth in Negotiations Act and Cost Accounting Standards, claims for submitting false cost or pricing data, and overcharging the government through underpayment of certain employees in violation of the Service Contract Act. The suit alleges such claimed violations defrauded the government in an amount approximating $
100
 million, and seeks, on behalf of the U.S. government, treble damages, civil penalties, interest, attorneys’ fees and costs, and expenses of suit. The Company and SCI intend to continue to defend vigorously the suit. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the Eckert Qui Tam Suit, although a loss currently is not considered to be probable or estimable. 
On November 14, 2023, former employee Gerardo Ramirez filed two lawsuits against the Company in the Alameda County Superior Court (together, the “Ramirez Cases”). The first, a putative class action, alleges violations of various California Labor Code and Wage Order requirements, including provisions governing overtime, meal and rest periods, minimum wage requirements, payment of wages during employment, wage statements, payroll records, and reimbursement of business expenses. The class action complaint seeks certification of a class of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company within the State of California at any time between March 1, 2021 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution, attorneys’ fees, pre-judgment interest, and costs of suit. The second action, a complaint under California’s Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), alleges substantially similar violations and a violation of the provision governing payment of final wages and seeks penalties individually and on behalf of the State of California and other “aggrieved employees,” along with attorneys’ fees and costs. On May 16, 2024 and June 14, 2024, former employee Carlos Lobatos filed class and PAGA actions in the Santa Clara County Superior Court (the “Lobatos Cases”) alleging violations substantially similar to the violations in the Ramirez Cases, and, in the case of the Lobatos PAGA action, additional violations related to sick leave, suitable rest facilities, seating, failure to retain and provide employment and payroll records, reporting time pay, day of rest rules, payroll deductions, paid time off, and various unlawful employment practices. The Lobatos class action complaint seeks certification of a class of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company (directly or via a staffing agency) within the State of California at any time between May 16, 2020 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution, attorneys’ fees, pre-judgment interest, and costs of suit. On August 12, 2024, former employee Mando Gomez filed a class and PAGA action in the Alameda County Superior Court (the “Gomez Case”) alleging violations substantially similar to the violations in the Ramirez Cases. The Gomez Case seeks certification of a class of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company (directly or via a staffing agency) within the State of California at any time between August 12, 2020 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution, attorneys’ fees, pre-judgment interest, and costs of suit. On September 20, 2024 and November 26, 2024, former employee Frank J. Leon Guerrero filed class and PAGA actions in the Alameda County Superior Court (the “Guerrero Cases”) alleging violations substantially similar to the violations in the Ramirez Cases. The Guerrero class action seeks certification of several classes comprised of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company (directly or via a staffing agency) within the State of California at any time between September 20, 2020 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution, attorneys’ fees, pre- and post-judgment interest, and costs of suit. The Company expects the Lobatos Cases, the Gomez Case, and the Guerrero Cases to be related to or consolidated with the Ramirez Cases and intends to defend all such cases vigorously. 
For each of the pending matters noted above, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss at this time.
69
Table of Contents
In addition, from time to time, the Company may become involved in routine legal proceedings, demands, claims, threatened litigation and regulatory inquiries and investigations that arise in the normal course of our business. The Company records liabilities for such matters when a loss becomes probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The effective tax rate for 2025 and 2024 was higher than the expected U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at rates higher than the U.S. statutory rate, state taxes, and unfavorable permanent differences. The effective tax rate for 2023 was lower than the expected U.S. statutory rate of 
21
% primarily due to a $
12
 million tax benefit resulting from the release of certain foreign tax reserves due to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations.

A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information and other factors, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company regularly assesses its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial results. Significant judgment is required in assessing the Company’s ability to generate revenue, gross profit, operating income and jurisdictional taxable income in future periods. The Company’s valuation allowance as of September 27, 2025 relates primarily to foreign net operating losses, except for $
11
 million related to U.S. state net operating losses.
The Company provides deferred tax liabilities for the tax consequences associated with the undistributed earnings that are expected to be repatriated to the subsidiaries’ parent unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. As of September 27, 2025, income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for approximately $
491
 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of several non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside of the U.S. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.

As of September 27, 2025, the Company has cumulative net operating loss carryforwards for state and foreign tax purposes of $
200
 million and $
481
 million, respectively, and 
none
 for federal tax. The state net operating loss carryforwards begin expiring in fiscal year 2026 and expire at various dates through 
September 26, 2043
. Certain foreign net operating losses will begin expiring in 2026. However, the majority of foreign net operating losses carryforward indefinitely. As of September 27, 2025, the Company has federal tax credits of $
8
 million that expire in 2045. There are certain restrictions on the 
71
Table of Contents
utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an “ownership change” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. The utilization of certain net operating losses may be restricted due to changes in ownership and business operations.

The Company had reserves of $
9
 million as of September 27, 2025 and $
8
 million as of September 28, 2024 for the payment of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits. During both 2025 and 2024, the Company recognized an income tax benefit for interest and penalties of $
1
 million due to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Should the Company be able to ultimately recognize all of these uncertain tax positions, it would result in a benefit to net income of $
31
 million in 2026. 
The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. 
As a result of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for fiscal 2008 through 2010, the Company received a Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) on November 17, 2023 asserting an underpayment of tax of approximately $
8
 million for fiscal 2009. The asserted underpayment results from the IRS’s proposed disallowance of a $
503
 million worthless stock deduction in fiscal 2009. Such disallowance, if upheld, would reduce the Company’s available net operating loss carryforwards and result in additional tax and interest attributable to fiscal 2021 and later years, which could be material. The Company disagrees with the IRS’s position as asserted in the RAR and is vigorously contesting this matter through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. The Company cannot predict with any certainty the timing of the resolution. Although the final resolution of this matter remains uncertain, the Company continues to believe that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax position will be sustained. However, an unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, the Company is being audited by various state tax agencies and certain foreign countries. To the extent the final tax liabilities are different from the amounts accrued, the increases or decreases would be recorded as income tax 
72
Table of Contents
expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of income. Although the Company believes that the resolution of these audits will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, the outcome is subject to uncertainty.
In general, the Company is no longer subject to United States federal or state income tax examinations for years before 2003, and to foreign examinations for years prior to 2006 in its major foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next twelve months by approximately $
8
 million related to payments, the resolution of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations. In addition, there could be a corresponding decrease in accrued interest and penalties of approximately $
2
 million.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. Various countries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax and where enacted, the rules begin to be effective for the Company in fiscal 2025. The Pillar Two rules are considered an alternative minimum tax and therefore deferred taxes would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated effects of the future minimum tax. The adoption and effective dates of these rules may vary by country and could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect the Company’s provision for income taxes. There was no material impact from these tax law changes in fiscal 2025.
On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was enacted in the U.S. The OBBBA includes significant provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, modifications to the international tax frame work, and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through 2027. Those that did have an effect on the Company’s fiscal 2025 tax year, such as 100% bonus reinstatement, have been calculated and included in the Company’s provision for income taxes. There was no material impact from the OBBBA to the fiscal 2025 financial statements.

Stockholders’ Equity
On March 11, 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved the Company’s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan”) and the reservation of 
4
 million shares of common stock for issuance thereunder, including any shares subject to stock options or similar awards granted under the 2009 Stock Plan that expired or otherwise terminated without having been exercised in full and shares issued pursuant to awards granted that are forfeited by the Company.

Table of Contents
As of September 27, 2025, an aggregate of 
5
 million shares were authorized for future issuance under the Company’s stock plans, of which 
3
 million of such shares were for issuance upon vesting of restricted stock units and 
2
 million shares of common stock were available for future grant. Awards other than stock options reduce common stock available for grant by 1.36 shares for every share of common stock subject to such an award. Awards under the 2019 Plan and 2009 Plan that expire or are cancelled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. The 2019 Plan will expire as to future grants in 
December 2028

Stock Repurchase Program
During 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company repurchased 
1.4
 million shares, 
4.0
 million shares and 
1.6
 million shares of its common stock for $
114
 million, $
227
 million and $
84
 million (including commissions), respectively, under stock repurchase programs authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors. During the second quarter of 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $
300
 million of the Company’s common stock in the open market or in negotiated private transactions. These programs have no expiration dates and the timing of repurchases will depend upon capital needs to support the growth of the Company’s business, market conditions and other factors. As of September 27, 2025, an aggregate of $
239
 million remains available under the stock purchase program.
In addition to the repurchases discussed above, the Company withheld 
0.5
 million of its common stock during each of 2025 and 2024 and 
0.4
 million shares of its common stock during 2023, in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units.

Business Segment and Geographic Information
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer who allocates resources and assesses performance of operating segments based on sales and a measure of segment gross profit that excludes items not directly related to the Company’s ongoing business operations. This assessment is predominantly performed during the Company’s annual budgeting and quarterly forecasting process where segment resourcing decisions, such as employee and capital, are made.
Segment revenue is attributable to the segment for which the products are manufactured or services are performed. Intersegment sales consist primarily of sales of components from CPS to IMS. Segment income, which is the segment gross profit, generally does not include stock-based compensation expense, litigation settlements, charges resulting from distressed customers and are either non-recurring or non-cash in nature.

The Company grants restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock units with performance conditions (“PSUs”) primarily to executive officers, directors and certain employees. These units vest over periods ranging from 
one year
 to 
four years
 and/or upon achievement of specified performance criteria, with associated compensation expense recognized ratably over the vesting period. 
Generally, the Company’s PSUs vest contingent on achievement of cumulative non-GAAP earnings per share measured over three fiscal years. If a minimum threshold is not achieved during the measurement period, the PSUs will be cancelled. If a minimum threshold is achieved or exceeded, the number of shares of common stock that will be issued will range from 
70
% to 
130
% of the number of PSUs granted, depending on the extent of performance. Additionally, for certain grants, the number of shares that vest may be adjusted up or down by up to 
15
% based on the Company’s total shareholder return relative to that of its peer group over this same period.

Employee Benefit Plans
The Company has various defined contribution retirement plans that cover the majority of its domestic employees. These retirement plans permit participants to elect to have contributions made to the retirement plans in the form of salary deferrals. Under these retirement plans, the Company may match a portion of employee contributions. Amounts contributed by the Company were not material for any period presented herein.

The Company sponsors a deferred compensation plan for eligible employees that allows participants to defer payment of all or part of their compensation. Deferrals under this plan were immaterial.

The Company provides defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries. The assumptions used for calculating the pension benefit obligations for non-U.S. plans depend on the local economic environment and regulations. The measurement date for the Company’s defined benefit plans is September 27, 2025.
The funded status and plan assets for the non-U.S defined benefit plans and amount reported on the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:

Business Combination
On May 18, 2025, the Company entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to acquire ZT Systems from AMD Design, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., pursuant to which the Company will purchase all of the outstanding equity interests of ZT Systems, a provider of AI and general purpose computer infrastructure for hyperscale computing companies. Under the Equity Purchase Agreement, the Company will acquire ZT Systems’ data center infrastructure manufacturing business, excluding certain research and development functions. The consideration is subject to certain adjustments based on ZT System’s closing cash, closing net working capital relative to a target amount, closing indebtedness and closing expenses. 
In connection with the execution of the Equity Purchase Agreement, the Company obtained the Bridge Loan Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $
2.5
 billion to fund a portion of the purchase consideration in the ZT Acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses. The commitment was intended to be drawn only to the extent that permanent financing was not obtained prior to closing the ZT Acquisition. On 
July 29, 2025
, the Company entered into the New Credit Agreement that provides for $
3.5
 billion in Credit Facilities, consisting of a $
1.5
 billion revolving credit facility and a $
2.0
 billion term loan A facility. On July 30, 2025, the Bridge Loan Facility was reduced from $
2.5
 billion to $
800
 million, upon the Company entering into the New Credit Agreement. Effective October 20, 2025, the Company executed an amendment to permit and finance the ZT Acquisition, including adding necessary definitions, funding conditions, and providing a delayed draw term loan A of $
600
 million, which may be drawn by the Company in up to two separate drawings during the period commencing on the closing of the ZT Acquisition and ending on the one year anniversary of such closing. Additionally, effective 
October 27, 2025
, the Company executed an amendment to increase the Credit Facilities to, among other amendments, include a $
800
 million term loan B facility.
During the year ended September 27, 2025, the Company incurred $
34
 million of acquisition and integration charges. These costs primarily consisted of advisory, legal, accounting, and other professional and consulting fees, and were expensed as incurred.
On the Closing Date, the Company completed the acquisition of ZT Systems pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement for a purchase consideration of $
1.6
 billion (subject to adjustment for certain working capital and other items) consisting of $
1.46
 billion in cash consideration and a number of shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $
150
 million (at $
130.32
 market value representing 
1.2
 million shares). Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, the seller is also entitled up to $
450
 million in contingent cash consideration upon the achievement of certain financial metrics during the three-year period following the Closing Date. The Company also entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement with ZT Systems on 
October 27, 2025
 with an initial term of five years. This transaction will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. To finance the acquisition and settle all outstanding amounts under the Company’s Existing Credit Agreement, the Company simultaneously drew upon its Credit Facilities at the Closing Date. 
The Company is in the process of determining the fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, with assistance from a third-party specialist. The initial accounting for the ZT Acquisition is incomplete due to the proximity of the transaction date to the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2025. The preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.
 The preliminary allocation is expected to result in the recognition of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible assets such as accounts receivable, inventories and property, plant, and equipment. The major classes of liabilities assumed are anticipated to be accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities.
 See Note 6, “Debt” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.

Item 9A.   
Controls and Procedures
(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that their objectives are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of disclosure controls and procedures must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all disclosure control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 27, 2025. 
Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 27, 2025 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b)

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 27, 2025 based on the criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the COSO.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under Item 8.
(c)

Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weaknesses
As previously disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures”, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, our management identified material weaknesses in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses we previously reported were as follows:
•
We identified material weaknesses in the control environment at one of our divisions due to this division maintaining an inappropriate tone at the top. Specifically, division management did not sufficiently promote, monitor or enforce appropriate accounting policies and procedures, thereby resulting in inappropriate and unsupported adjustments to the quarterly contract cost estimate process. Additionally, we did not maintain a sufficient complement of finance personnel at the division with an appropriate level of expertise, knowledge and training in internal control over financial reporting commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. These material weaknesses contributed to an additional material weakness that the division did not design and maintain effective controls over the quarterly contract estimate review process, which lead to the failure to timely and appropriately record adjustments to quarterly estimates.
•
We identified an additional material weakness as the Company did not design and maintain effective controls to properly support and account for the transfer of control to its customers of certain raw materials inventory.
79
Table of Contents
Management has concluded that these material weaknesses have been remediated as of the end of fiscal 2025. The applicable controls have been in place and operated for a sufficient period of time and management concluded, through testing, that these controls were operating effectively.
(d)

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 27, 2025 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
