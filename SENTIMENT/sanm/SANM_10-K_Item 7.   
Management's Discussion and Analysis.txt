Overview

We are a leading global provider of integrated manufacturing solutions, components, products and repair, logistics and after-market services. Our revenue is generated from sales of our products and services primarily to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that serve the industrial, medical, defense and aerospace, automotive, communications networks and cloud solutions industries.
Our operations are managed as two businesses:  
1)  Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (“IMS”). Our IMS segment consists of printed circuit board assembly and test, high-level assembly and test and direct-order-fulfillment.
2)  Components, Products and Services (“CPS”). Components include advanced printed circuit boards, backplanes and backplane assemblies, cable assemblies, fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts. Products include optical, radio frequency (“RF”) and microelectronic design and manufacturing services from our Advanced Microsystems Technologies division; multi-chip package memory solutions from our Viking Technology division; high-performance storage platforms for hyperscale and enterprise solutions from our Viking Enterprise Solutions division; defense and aerospace product, design, manufacturing, repair and refurbishment services from our SCI Technology Inc. (“SCI”) subsidiary; and cloud-based smart manufacturing execution software from our 42Q division. Services include design, engineering, and logistics and repair.
Our only reportable segment for financial reporting purposes is IMS, which represented approximately 80% of our total revenue in 2024. Our CPS business consists of multiple operating segments which do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for being presented as reportable segments. Therefore, financial information for these operating segments is combined and presented in a single category entitled “CPS”.

Our strategy is to leverage our comprehensive product and service offerings, advanced technologies and global capabilities to further penetrate diverse end markets that we believe offer significant growth opportunities and have complex products that require higher value-added services. We believe this strategy differentiates us from our competitors and will help drive more sustainable revenue growth and provide opportunities for us to achieve operating margins that exceed industry standards. 
A core component of our business strategy is to establish and retain long-term customer partnerships with companies. Historically, we have had substantial recurring sales to existing customers. Sales to our ten largest customers typically represent approximately 50% of our net sales in any given year. 
We typically enter into supply agreements with our major OEM customers. These agreements generally have terms ranging from three to five years and cover the manufacture of a range of products. Under these agreements, a customer typically purchases its requirements for specific products in particular geographic areas from us. However, these agreements generally do not obligate the customer to purchase minimum quantities of products. In addition, some customer contracts contain cost reduction objectives, which can have the effect of reducing revenue from such customers.
We generate about 80% of our net sales from products manufactured in our foreign operations. The concentration of foreign operations has resulted primarily from a desire on the part of many of our customers to manufacture in lower-cost locations in regions such as Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe and we plan to expand our presence as appropriate to meet the needs of our customers. We also intend to continue to invest in factory automation, process improvements, robotics and artificial intelligence, keeping up with the trends in technology to further enhance our efficiency output. 
Trends and Uncertainties

We believe our end-to-end manufacturing solutions combined with our global supply chain management expertise differentiates us from our competitors and enables us to better serve the needs of OEMs. However, our business faces many challenges. For example, we compete with a number of companies in each of our key end markets. This includes companies that are much larger than we are and smaller companies that focus on a particular niche product, service or end market. Although we believe we are well-positioned in each of our key end markets and offer many advantages compared to our competitors, competition remains intense and profitably growing our revenues has been challenging. Additionally, we are impacted by macroeconomic challenges such as inflation, supply chain constraints, foreign currency fluctuations, high interest rates, market volatility, recession concerns, tariffs and other factors that have been and could be in the future exacerbated by geopolitical conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and results of the U.S. presidential election. Although supply chain constraints have been easing, we expect headwinds to our revenue growth that will continue in 2025 due to customers absorbing their finished goods inventory in some of our end markets. 
Despite these challenges, we remain focused on improving our operations, building flexibility and efficiencies in our processes and adjusting our business models to changing circumstances. We intend to continue diversifying into mission critical markets and creating a portfolio of more complex, higher technology products with longer product life cycles. As our end markets evolve and grow, our ability to optimize our product and portfolio mix towards higher value opportunities will continue to be an important driver for our business going forward.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). We review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the process used to develop estimates related to accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, environmental matters, litigation and other contingencies, as well as estimates related to costs expected to be incurred to satisfy performance obligations under long-term contracts and variable consideration related to such contracts. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We have considered information available to us as of the date of issuance of these financial statements and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that would require an update to our estimates or judgments, or a revision to the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. Our estimates may change as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 

We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used by us in preparing our consolidated financial statements:
Revenue Recognition.
 We recognize revenue for the majority of our contracts on an over time basis. This is primarily due to the fact that we do not have an alternative use for the end products we manufacture for our customers and have an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit, for work in progress upon a customer's cancellation of a contract for convenience. In certain circumstances, we recognize over time because our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by our services or, our customer controls the end product as we perform manufacturing services (continuous transfer of control). For these contracts, revenue is recognized on an over time basis using the cost-to-cost method (ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion) which we believe best depicts the transfer of control to the customer.
In our Defense and Aerospace division, we apply the cost-to-cost method for government contracts which requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs included in the total estimated costs at completion. Additionally, we evaluate whether contract modifications for claims have been approved and, if so, estimate the amount, if any, of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price of the contract.
Estimates of materials, labor and subcontractor costs expected to be incurred to satisfy a performance obligation are updated on a quarterly basis. These estimates consider costs incurred to date and estimated costs to be incurred over the remaining expected period of performance to satisfy a performance obligation. There is inherent uncertainty in estimating the amount of costs that will be required to complete a contract. Factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in estimates include, among others, (1) the long-term duration of contracts, (2) the highly-complex nature of the products we manufacture, (3) the readiness of our customer’s design for manufacturing, (4) the cost and availability of purchased materials, (5) labor cost, availability and productivity, (6) subcontractor performance and (7) the risk of delayed performance/completion. Therefore, such estimates are reviewed each quarter by a group of employees that includes representatives from numerous functions such as engineering, materials, contracts, manufacturing, program management, finance and senior management. If a change in estimate is deemed necessary, the impact of the change is recognized in the period of change. Additionally, contract modifications for claims are assessed each quarter to determine whether the claims have been approved. If it is determined that a claim has been approved, the amount of the claim, if any, that can be included in transaction price is estimated considering a number of factors such as the length of time expected to lapse until uncertainty about the claim has been resolved and the extent to which our experience with claims for similar contracts has predictive value.
Changes in our estimates of transaction price and/or costs to complete result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to revenue and operating income. The impact of changes in estimates on revenue and operating income resulting from application of the cost-to-cost method for recognizing revenue was as follows:

For contracts for which revenue is required to be recognized at a point-in-time, we recognize revenue when we have transferred control of the related goods, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of the goods to the customer. Revenue streams for which revenue is recognized at a point-in-time include our proprietary products and sales of raw materials.
Inventories—
 We state inventories at the lower of cost (based on standard cost, which approximates first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Cost includes raw materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. We regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and make provisions to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. The ultimate realization of inventory carrying amounts is affected by changes in customer demand for inventory that customers are not contractually obligated to purchase and inventory held for specific customers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Inventory write-downs are recorded based on forecasted demand, past experience with specific customers, the ability to redistribute inventory to other programs or return inventories to our suppliers, and whether customers are contractually obligated and have the ability to pay for the related inventory. Certain payments received from customers for inventories that have not been shipped to customers or otherwise disposed of are netted against inventory. 

We generally procure inventory based on specific customer orders and forecasts. Customers generally have limited rights of modification (for example, rescheduling or cancellations) with respect to specific orders. Customer modifications of orders affecting inventory previously procured by us and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs may result in excess and obsolete inventory. Although we may be able to use some excess inventory for other products we manufacture, a portion of this excess inventory may not be returnable to vendors or recoverable from customers. Write-offs or write-downs of inventory could be caused by:
•
changes in customer demand for inventory, such as cancellation of orders, and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs that result in excess quantities on hand that we are not able to return to the vendor, use to fulfill orders from other customers or charge back to the customer;
•
financial difficulties experienced by specific customers for whom we hold inventory; and
•
declines in the market value of inventory. 
Our raw materials inventories are generally acquired in anticipation of specific customer orders and pursuant to customer-specific design specifications. When we and our customers agree that the quantity of customer-specific inventory is in excess of anticipated demand, we may transfer control of those inventories to our customers in exchange for a cash payment. These transactions are reported as transfers of non-financial assets – i.e., reported on a net basis in the income statement.
Long-lived Assets
— We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An asset group is the unit of accounting that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. An asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If an asset or asset group is considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. For asset groups for which a building is the primary asset, we estimate fair value primarily based on data provided by commercial real estate brokers. For other assets, we estimate fair value based on projected discounted future net cash flows, which requires significant judgment. 
Consolidation
— In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), we consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In fiscal 2023, we completed a joint venture transaction with Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited (“RSBVL”) to establish Sanmina SCI India Private Limited (“SIPL”), our existing Indian manufacturing entity, as a joint venture. As a result of the transaction, RSBVL holds 50.1% of the outstanding shares of SIPL and we hold the remaining 49.9% of the outstanding shares of SIPL. In connection with RSBVL’s investment, we entered into a management services contract pursuant to which we have the unilateral ability to make the significant financial and operating decisions made in the ordinary course of SIPL’s business. We determined the voting interest model was applicable under ASC 810 and 
36
Table of Contents
concluded that, despite not having a majority ownership interest, we have a controlling financial interest in SIPL through the management services contract. Therefore, we have, by contract, the unilateral ability to control the significant decisions made in the ordinary course of SIPL’s business and, as such, we consolidate SIPL. However, we periodically assess whether any changes in facts and circumstances have occurred that could require us to deconsolidate SIPL.
Income Taxes—
 We estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We believe our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter. Although we believe our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate, tax regulations are subject to interpretation and the tax controversy process is inherently lengthy and uncertain; therefore, our assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. To the extent the probable tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. We only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold of being upheld. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.

We must also make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. We evaluate positive and negative evidence each reporting period when assessing the need for a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if we believe realization of such assets is not more likely than not. Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, new or modified tax laws, tax planning strategies or other factors. If our assumptions, and consequently our estimates, change in the future, the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense. 
Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the amount and geographic distribution of our worldwide income or losses, the tax regulations, rates and holidays in each geographic region, the utilization of net operating losses, the availability of tax credits and carryforwards, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.

Comparison of 2024 to 2023 by End Market
The decrease in sales was primarily due to reduced demand caused by customers in some end markets, particularly communications networks, making adjustments to absorb their finished goods inventory. The impact of this was partially offset by new program wins and program ramps in our automotive and communications networks end markets.
Gross Margin

Gross margin was 8.5%, 8.3% and 7.9% in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. IMS gross margin decreased slightly to 7.5% in 2024 from 7.7% in 2023. CPS gross margin increased to 12.8% in 2024 from 11.6% in 2023, primarily due to significant losses recognized on certain fixed-price customer contracts in 2023 compared to 2024, the effect of which was partially offset by unfavorable product mix.
We have experienced fluctuations in gross margin in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Fluctuations in our gross margin may be caused by a number of factors, including:
•
the impacts of supply chain constraints on our operations, the operations of our suppliers and on our customers’ businesses;
•
capacity utilization which, if lower, results in lower margins due to fixed costs being absorbed by lower volumes;
•
changes in the mix of high and low margin products demanded by our customers;
38
Table of Contents
•
competition in the EMS industry and pricing pressures from OEMs due to greater focus on cost reduction;
•
the amount of our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, including those associated with distressed customers;
•
levels of operational efficiency and production yields; 
•
our performance on long-term contracts, including our ability to recover claims for cost overruns; and
•
our ability to transition the location of and ramp up manufacturing and assembly operations when requested by a customer in a timely and cost-effective manner.
Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $266 million, $255 million and $245 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 3.5%, 2.9% and 3.1% for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars in 2024 from 2023 was primarily due to higher stock compensation expense from new equity grants, higher variable compensation and an increase in deferred compensation caused by strong stock market performance that increased the market value of participant investment accounts, partially offset by lower professional fees.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses were $29 million, $26 million and $21 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses were 0.4% for 2024 and 0.3% for 2023 and 2022. The increase in absolute dollars in 2024 from 2023 was primarily due to higher expenses for design and engineering support for existing and new projects.
Other Expense
Other expense was $1 million in 2024, $20 million in 2023 and a $26 million in 2022. The decrease in other expense in 2024 was primarily caused by a $12 million decrease in discount of sold receivables in 2024 due to significantly lower factoring levels and an incremental gain of $5 million in the market value of participant investment accounts in our deferred compensation plan.
Provision for Income Taxes

We recorded income tax expense of $80 million, $85 million and $62 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 25%, 21% and 20% for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The tax rate was lower in 2023 and 2022 primarily due to larger discrete items, including recognized tax benefits from the release of certain foreign tax reserves due to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations.
As a result of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for fiscal 2008 through 2010, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) on November 17, 2023 asserting an underpayment of tax of approximately $8 million for fiscal 2009. The asserted underpayment results from the IRS’s proposed disallowance of a 
$503 million
 worthless stock deduction in fiscal 2009. Such disallowance, if upheld, would reduce our available net operating loss carryforwards and result in additional tax and interest attributable to fiscal 2021 and later years, which could be material. We disagree with the IRS’s position as asserted in the RAR and are vigorously contesting this matter through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. We do not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with any certainty the timing of such resolution. Although the final resolution of this matter remains uncertain, we continue to believe that it is more likely than not our tax position will be sustained. However, an unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. Various countries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax and where enacted, the rules begin to be effective for us in fiscal 2025. The Pillar Two rules are considered an alternative minimum tax and therefore deferred taxes would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated effects of the future minimum tax. The adoption and effective dates of these rules may vary by country and could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. We do not expect any material impact from these tax law changes in fiscal 2025.

Cash and cash equivalents were $626 million at September 28, 2024 and $668 million at September 30, 2023. Our cash levels vary during any given period depending on the timing of collections from customers and payments to suppliers, borrowings under credit facilities, sales of accounts receivable under numerous programs we utilize, repurchases of capital stock and other factors. Our working capital was approximately $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $340 million, $235 million and $331 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our working capital metrics tend to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on factors such as the linearity of our 
40
Table of Contents
shipments to customers and purchases from suppliers, customer and supplier mix, and payment terms with customers and suppliers. These fluctuations can significantly affect our cash flows from operating activities.
During 2024, we generated $447 million of cash from earnings, excluding non-cash items, and used $107 million of cash primarily because of a decrease in accounts payable of $112 million, an increase in accrued liabilities of $12 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $104 million, partially offset by a decrease in inventories of $36 million. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily attributable to an unfavorable mix of supplier payment terms and lower inventory receipts, resulting in DPO decreasing from 80 days in 2023 to 71 days in 2024. The increase in accrued liabilities was due primarily to  customer payments for certain inventory partially offset by a decrease in amounts collected under our accounts receivable factoring program that had not been remitted as of the end of the period to the financial institutions that purchased the receivables. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to unfavorable customer payment terms mix. The decrease in inventories is primarily due to our ongoing efforts to reduce inventory to more appropriate levels primarily by working with customers to ensure their demand forecasts are reasonable and incorporate appropriate lead times to secure materials. 
During 2023, we generated $527 million of cash from earnings, excluding non-cash items, and used $292 million of cash primarily because of a decrease in accounts payable of $418 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $89 million, partially offset by a decrease in inventories of $210 million. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily attributable to lower inventory receipts and an unfavorable mix of supplier payment terms, resulting in DPO decreasing from 90 days in 2022 to 80 days in 2023. The decrease in inventories was primarily due to lower business volume and our efforts to reduce inventory to more appropriate levels primarily by working with customers to ensure their demand forecasts are reasonable and incorporate appropriate lead times to secure materials. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to higher business volume and unfavorable customer payment terms mix. 
Net cash used in investing activities was $114 million, $192 million and $132 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2024 and 2023, we used $111 million and $191 million, respectively, of cash for capital expenditures.

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(270) million, $95 million and $(314) million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2024, we repurchased $254 million of common stock (including $26 million in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations), repaid an aggregate of $22 million of long-term debt and received $6 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock pursuant to stock option exercises. In 2023, we repurchased $107 million of common stock (including $23 million in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations), repaid an aggregate of $18 million of long-term debt, paid a final payment of $9 million in connection with a previous business combination, received $216 million from sale of shares of SIPL to RSBVL and received $8 million proceeds from short-term borrowing.
Revolving Credit Facility. 
The Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2022, as amended, (the “Credit Agreement”), provides for an $800 million revolving credit facility and a $350 million secured term loan (the “Term Loan Due 2027”), together with an accordion feature by which we can obtain, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions and commitment of the lenders, additional revolving commitments in an aggregate amount of up to $200 million. 
As of September 28, 2024, no borrowings and $14 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement, under which $786 million was available to borrow. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2023.
Short-term Borrowing Facilities.
 We had no short-term borrowings outstanding as of September 28, 2024 and $8 million of short-term borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries had a total of $71 million of short-term borrowing facilities available, under which no borrowings were outstanding as of September 28, 2024. Some of these facilities expire at various dates through the second quarter of 2025 and are expected to be renewed.
Other Liquidity Matters
During 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 4.0 million shares and 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $227 million and $84 million (including commissions), respectively, under stock repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. These programs have no expiration dates and the timing of repurchases will depend upon capital needs to support the growth of our business, market conditions and other factors. Although stock repurchases are intended to increase stockholder value, purchases of shares reduce our liquidity. As a result, the timing of future repurchases depends upon our future capital needs, market conditions and other factors. As of September 28, 2024, an aggregate of $53 million remains available under these programs.

Table of Contents
We are party to a Receivables Purchase Agreement (the “RPA”) with certain third-party banking institutions for the sale of accounts receivable generated from sales to certain customers. The amount available under the RPA is uncommitted and, as such, is available at the discretion of our third-party banking institutions. Under the Credit Agreement, the percentage of our total accounts receivable that can be sold and outstanding at any time is 50%. Therefore, as of September 28, 2024, a maximum of $490 million of sold receivables could be outstanding at any point in time under this program, as amended, as required by our Credit Agreement. Accounts receivables sold pursuant to the RPA are serviced by us. 
In addition to the RPA, we participate in accounts receivable sales programs that have been implemented by certain of our customers, as in effect from time to time. We do not service accounts receivable sold under these other programs.
The sale of receivables under all of these programs is subject to the approval of the banks or customers involved and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell the maximum amount of receivables permitted by these programs when desired.
Under each of the programs noted above, we sell our entire interest in an accounts receivable for 100% of face value, less a discount. For the years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we sold approximately $1.1 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of accounts receivable under these programs. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, $34 million and $162 million, respectively, of accounts receivable sold under the RPA and subject to servicing by us remained outstanding and had not yet been collected. Our sole risk with respect to receivables we service is with respect to commercial disputes regarding such receivables. Commercial disputes include billing errors, returns and similar matters. To date, we have not been required to repurchase any receivable we have sold due to a commercial dispute. Additionally, we are required to remit amounts collected as servicer on a weekly basis to the financial institutions that purchased the receivables. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, $3 million and $33 million, respectively, had been collected but not yet remitted. This amount is classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
We enter into forward interest rate swap agreements with independent counterparties to partially hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in Secured Overnight Financing Rate benchmark interest rate associated with anticipated variable rate borrowings. See Note 5 “Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for details.
In the ordinary course of business, we are or may become party to legal proceedings, claims and other contingencies, including environmental, warranty and employee matters and examinations by government agencies. As of September 28, 2024, we had accrued liabilities of $39 million related to such matters. We cannot accurately predict the outcome of these matters or the amount or timing of cash flows that may be required to defend ourselves or to settle such matters or that these reserves will be sufficient to fully satisfy our contingent liabilities.  
As of September 28, 2024, we had a liability of $57 million for uncertain tax positions. Our estimate of liabilities for uncertain tax positions is based on a number of subjective assessments, including the likelihood of a tax obligation being assessed, the amount of taxes (including interest and penalties) that would ultimately be payable, and our ability to settle any such obligations on favorable terms. Therefore, the amount of future cash flows associated with uncertain tax positions may be significantly higher or lower than our recorded liability and we are unable to reliably estimate when cash settlement may occur. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by approximately $8 million due to payments, the resolution of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations. In addition, there could be a corresponding decrease in accrued interest and penalties of approximately $2 million. 

Our liquidity is largely dependent on changes in our working capital, including sales of accounts receivable under our receivables sales programs and the extension of trade credit by our suppliers, investments in manufacturing inventory, facilities and equipment, repayments of obligations under outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of common stock. In 2024, we generated $340 million of cash from operations. Our primary sources of liquidity as of September 28, 2024 consisted of (1) cash and cash equivalents of $626 million; (2) our Credit Agreement, under which $786 million, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, was available; (3) our foreign short-term borrowing facilities of $71 million, all of which was available; (4) proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable under our receivables sales programs; and (5) cash generated from operations. Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from existing and/or new lenders, we may increase the revolver commitments under the Credit Agreement by an additional $200 million.

We believe our existing cash resources and other sources of liquidity, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements through at least the next 12 months. However, should demand for our services decrease significantly over the next 12 months, should we be unable to recover on inventory obligations owed to us 
42
Table of Contents
by our customers or should we experience significant increases in delinquent or uncollectible accounts receivable for any reason, our cash provided by operations could decrease significantly and we could be required to seek additional sources of liquidity to continue our operations at their current level.
We invest our cash in numerous financial institutions that we believe to be of high quality. However, there can be no assurance that one or more of such institutions will not become insolvent in the future, in which case all or a portion of our uninsured funds on deposit with such institutions could be lost.
As of September 28, 2024, approximately 34% of our cash balance was held in the United States. Should we choose or need to remit cash to the United States from our foreign locations, we may incur tax obligations which would reduce the amount of cash ultimately available to the United States. We believe that cash held in the United States, together with liquidity available under our Credit Agreement and cash from foreign subsidiaries that could be remitted to the United States without tax consequences, will be sufficient to meet our United States liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. SIPL’s cash and cash equivalents balance of $200 million as of September 28, 2024 is not available for general corporate purposes and must be retained in SIPL to fund its operations. 
Contractual Obligations

As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments. These obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. Our estimated future obligations consist of leases, our Term Loan Due 2027, pension plan funding obligations and unrecognized tax benefits as of September 28, 2024.
A summary of our operating lease obligations as of September 28, 2024 can be found in Note 7 “Leases” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.
A summary of our long-term debt obligations as of September 28, 2024 can be found in Note 6 “Debt” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. 
We have defined benefit pension plans with an underfunded amount of $39 million as of September 28, 2024. We will be required to provide additional funding to these plans in the future if our returns on plan assets are not sufficient to meet our funding obligations. See Note 15 “Employee Benefit Plans” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.
The Company’s long-term liabilities arising from unrecognized tax benefits can be found in Note 10 “Income Tax” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.
We also have outstanding firm purchase orders with certain suppliers for the purchase of inventory which are generally short-term in nature. Orders for standard, or catalog, items can typically be canceled with little or no financial penalty. Our policy regarding non-standard or customized items dictates that such items are only ordered specifically for customers who have contractually assumed liability for the inventory, although exceptions are made to this policy in certain situations. Accordingly, our liability from purchase obligations under these purchase orders is not expected to be significant. Lastly, pursuant to arrangements under which vendors consign inventory to us, we may be required to purchase such inventory after a certain period of time. To date, we have not been required to purchase a significant amount of inventory pursuant to these time limitations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of September 28, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.

Item 7A.   
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Our primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our Term Loan Due 2027, under which $319 million is currently outstanding, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility, for which the interest rate we pay is based on a floating index. As of September 28, 2024, we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million that effectively convert our floating rate Term Loan Due 2027 to a fixed rate term loan. An immediate 10 percent change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations. For more information about our debt and derivative instruments, see Note 5 “Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk” and Note 6 “Debt” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We transact business in foreign currencies. Our foreign exchange policy requires that we take certain steps to limit our foreign exchange exposures resulting from certain assets and liabilities and forecasted cash flows. However, our policy does not require us to hedge all foreign exchange exposures. Furthermore, our foreign currency hedges are based on forecasted transactions and estimated balances, the amount of which may differ from that actually incurred. As a result, we can experience foreign exchange gains and losses in our results of operations.

We enter into short-term foreign currency forward contracts to hedge currency exposures associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies such as Indian rupee, Mexican peso and Chinese renminbi. These contracts generally have maturities of up to two months and these forward contracts are not designated as part of a hedging relationship for accounting purposes. Accordingly, all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked-to-market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in other expense, in the consolidated statements of income. From an economic perspective, the objective of our hedging program is for gains or losses on forward contracts to substantially offset gains and losses on the underlying hedged items. As of September 28, 2024, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts to exchange various foreign currencies for U.S. dollars in an aggregate notional amount of $366 million. 
We also utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain operational (“cash flow”) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from (1) forecasted non-functional currency sales and (2) forecasted non-functional currency materials, labor, overhead and other expenses. These contracts may be up to twelve months in duration and are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the contracts is recorded in stockholders' equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. We had forward contracts related to cash flow hedges in various foreign currencies in an aggregate notional amount of $117 million as of September 28, 2024. 
The net impact of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates would not be material to our consolidated financial statements, provided we accurately forecast and estimate our foreign currency exposure. If such forecasts are materially inaccurate, we could incur significant gains or losses.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Bo
ard of Directors and Stockholders of Sanmina Corporation 
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sanmina Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO because material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to (i) inappropriate tone at the top in the control environment at one of the Company’s divisions, specifically division management did not sufficiently promote, monitor or enforce appropriate accounting policies and procedures, thereby resulting in inappropriate and unsupported adjustments to the quarterly contract cost estimate process; (ii) the Company not maintaining a sufficient complement of finance personnel at the division with an appropriate level of expertise, knowledge and training in internal control over financial reporting commensurate with the Company’s financial reporting requirements; (iii) the division not designing and maintaining effective controls over the quarterly contract estimate review process, which led to the failure to timely and appropriately record adjustments to quarterly estimates; and (iv) the Company not designing and maintaining effective controls to properly support and account for the transfer of control to its customers of certain raw materials inventory.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses referred to above are described in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered these material weaknesses in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  
Basis for Opinions 
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition using the Cost-to-cost Method for Government Contracts in the Defense and Aerospace Division
As described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues for the CPS segment were $1.5 billion for the year ended September 28, 2024, of which the defense and aerospace division represents a portion of the segment. The Company recognizes revenue for defense and aerospace government contracts on an over time basis using the cost-to-cost method (ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion), which management believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Recognition of revenue on government contracts requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition using the cost-to-cost method for government contracts in the defense and aerospace division is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated costs for such contracts and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence related to management’s determination of estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs. Also, as described in the “Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting” section, material weaknesses were identified related to this matter.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the estimation of costs for a sample of defense and aerospace government contracts; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the estimate; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s determination of estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s determination of the estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs used involved (i) assessing management’s ability to reasonably estimate costs for government contracts by assessing the nature and status of government contracts; (ii) performing retrospective reviews of government contract estimates and changes in estimates over time; and (iii) obtaining evidence to support estimated costs.

SANMINA CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. 
Organization of Sanmina 

Sanmina Corporation (“Sanmina,” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware in 1989. The Company is a leading global provider of integrated manufacturing solutions, components, products and repair, logistics and after-market services. The Company provides these comprehensive solutions primarily to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that serve the industrial, medical, defense and aerospace, automotive, communications networks and cloud infrastructure industries.
The Company's operations are managed as two businesses:  
1)
Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (“IMS”). IMS is a single operating segment consisting of printed circuit board assembly and test, high-level assembly and test and direct-order-fulfillment.
2)
Components, Products and Services (“CPS”). Components include printed circuit boards, backplanes and backplane assemblies, cable assemblies, fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts. Products include optical, radio frequency and microelectronic design and manufacturing services from the Company’s Advanced Microsystems Technologies division; multi-chip package memory solutions from the Company’s Viking Technology division; high-performance storage platforms for hyperscale and enterprise solutions from the Company’s Viking Enterprise Solutions division; defense and aerospace products, design, manufacturing, repair and refurbishment services from the Company’s SCI Technology, Inc. (“SCI”) subsidiary; and cloud-based smart manufacturing execution software from the Company’s 42Q division. Services include design, engineering, and logistics and repair. 
The Company's only reportable segment is IMS, which represented approximately 
80
% of total revenue in 2024. CPS consists of multiple operating segments which do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for being presented as reportable segments. Therefore, financial information for these operating segments is combined and presented in a single category entitled “CPS”. The accounting policies for each segment are the same as those disclosed by the Company for its consolidated financial statements. 

Basis of Presentation
Fiscal Year.
 The Company operates on a 52 or 53 week year ending on the Saturday nearest September 30. Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were each a 52 week year. All references to years relate to fiscal years unless otherwise noted.

Principles of Consolidation.
 The consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All intra-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Noncontrolling interest represents a noncontrolling investor’s interest in the results of operations of subsidiaries that the Company controls and consolidates.
Reclassification. 
Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes.

Note 2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Management Estimates and Uncertainties.
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company has considered information available to it as of the date of issuance of these financial statements and is not aware of any specific events or circumstances that would require an update to its estimates or judgments, or a revision to the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements relate to allowances for accounts receivable; provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, environmental matters, and legal exposures; determining liabilities for uncertain tax positions; determining the realizability of deferred tax assets; determining fair values of tangible and intangible assets for purposes of impairment tests; and estimating costs expected to be incurred to satisfy performance obligations under long-term contracts and variable consideration related to such contracts. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

Table of Contents

Financial Instruments.
 Financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements, accounts payable and debt obligations. The fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 due to the nature or short maturity of these instruments, or because, in some cases, the instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and investments in highly liquid debt instruments with initial maturities of three months or less.

Accounts Receivable and Other Related Allowances.
 The Company had allowances of approximately $
7
 million and $
8
 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, for uncollectible accounts, product returns and other net sales adjustments. To establish the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company estimates credit risk associated with accounts receivable by considering the creditworthiness of its customers, past experience, specific facts and circumstances, and the overall economic climate in industries that it serves. To establish the allowance for product returns and other adjustments, the Company primarily utilizes historical data.

Accounts Receivable Sales.
 The Company is a party to a Receivables Purchase Agreement (the “RPA”) with certain third-party banking institutions for the sale of accounts receivable generated from sales to certain customers, subject to acceptance by, and a funding commitment from, the banks that are party to the RPA. Accounts receivable sold pursuant to the RPA are serviced by the Company.
In addition to the RPA, the Company has the option to participate in accounts receivable sales programs that have been implemented by certain of the Company’s customers, as in effect from time to time. The Company does not service accounts receivable sold under these other programs. Under each of the programs noted above, the Company sells its entire interest in accounts receivable for 100% of face value, less a discount. Accounts receivable balances sold are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and the related proceeds are reported as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Inventories.
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (based on standard cost, which approximates first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Cost includes labor, materials and manufacturing overhead.

Provisions are made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. The ultimate realization of inventory carrying amounts is primarily affected by changes in customer demand. Inventory provisions are established based on forecasted demand, past experience with specific customers, the age and nature of the inventory, the ability to redistribute inventory to other programs or back to suppliers and whether customers are contractually obligated and have the ability to pay for the related inventory. The Company’s raw materials inventories are generally acquired in anticipation of specific customer orders and pursuant to customer-specific design specifications. When the Company and its customers agree that the quantity of customer-specific inventory is in excess of anticipated demand, the Company will transfer control of those inventories to its customers in exchange for a cash payment. These transactions are reported as transfers of non-financial assets – i.e., reported on a net basis in the income statement.
Long-lived Assets.
 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or, in the case of property and equipment acquired through business combinations, at fair value as of the acquisition date. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over 
20
 to 
40
 years for buildings and 
3
 to 
15
 years for machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the asset.  

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An asset group is the unit of accounting which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. An asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. For asset groups for which the primary asset is a building, the Company estimates fair value based on data provided by commercial real estate brokers. For other asset groups, the Company estimates fair value based on projected discounted future net cash flows.

Foreign Currency Translation.
 For foreign subsidiaries using the local currency as their functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expenses are 
53
Table of Contents
translated at average exchange rates. The effects of these translation adjustments are reported in stockholder’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). For all entities, remeasurement adjustments for non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from long-term intercompany loans denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency are recorded in AOCI if repayment of the loan is not anticipated in the foreseeable future.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
 The Company conducts business on a global basis in numerous currencies and certain of the Company’s outstanding debt has a variable interest rate. Therefore, the Company is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivatives, such as foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps, to minimize the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 

The Company accounts for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with ASC Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, which requires each derivative instrument to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value as either an asset or a liability. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the Company excludes the change in the fair value of the contract related to the changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward price from its assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes these amounts, which are primarily related to time value, in earnings over the life of the derivative instrument. Gains or losses on the derivative not caused by changes in time value are recorded in AOCI, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Derivative instruments are entered into for periods of time consistent with the related underlying exposures and are not entered into for speculative purposes. At the inception of a hedge, the Company documents all relationships between derivative instruments and related hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategies for the hedging transaction.

The Company’s foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps potentially expose the Company to credit risk to the extent the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. The Company minimizes such risk by seeking high quality counterparties.

Leases. 
The Company's leases consist of operating leases for buildings and land and have initial lease terms of up to 
44
 years. Certain of these leases contain an option to extend the lease term for additional periods or to terminate the lease after an initial non-cancelable term. Renewal options are considered in the measurement of the Company’s initial lease liability and corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset only if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. Leases with a term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the Company’s balance sheet.
The Company’s lease liability and ROU assets represent the present value of future fixed lease payments which are a combination of lease components and non-lease components such as maintenance and utilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of the Company’s lease payments are variable because such payments adjust periodically based on changes in consumer price and other indexes. Variable payments are expensed as incurred and not included in the measurement of lease liabilities and ROU assets. Since the Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date for purposes of determining the present value of lease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is based on the term of the lease, the economic environment of the lease and the effect of collateralization, if any.
Revenue Recognition.
 The Company derives revenue principally from sales of integrated manufacturing solutions, components and Company-proprietary products. Other sources of revenue include logistics and repair services; design, development and engineering services; defense and aerospace programs; and sales of raw materials to customers whose requirements change after the Company has procured inventory to fulfill the customer’s forecasted demand.
The Company determines the appropriate revenue to recognize as described in ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
(“ASC 606”) by applying a 5-step model: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Each of these steps may involve the use of significant judgments, as discussed below.
Step 1 - Identify the contract with a customer
The Company generally enters into a master supply agreement (“MSA”) with its customers that provides the framework under which business will be conducted, and pursuant to which a customer will issue purchase orders or other 
54
Table of Contents
binding documents to specify the quantity, price and delivery requirements for products or services the customer wishes to purchase. The Company generally considers its contract with a customer to be a firm commitment, consisting of the combination of an MSA and a purchase order or any other similar binding document.
Step 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract
A performance obligation is a promised good or service that is material in the context of the contract and is both capable of being distinct (customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources) and distinct within the context of the contract (separately identifiable from other promises). The Company reviews its contracts to identify promised goods or services and then evaluates such items to determine which of those items are performance obligations. The majority of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation since the promise to transfer an individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company’s performance obligations generally have an expected duration of one year or less.
Step 3 - Determine the transaction price
Contracts with customers may include certain forms of variable consideration such as early payment discounts, volume discounts and shared cost savings. The Company includes an estimate of variable consideration when determining the transaction price and the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized. This estimate is limited to an amount which will not result in a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. Factors considered in the Company’s estimate of variable consideration are the potential amount subject to these contract provisions, historical experience and other relevant facts and circumstances. 
Step 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. In the event that more than one performance obligation is identified in a contract, a portion of the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation. This allocation would generally be based on the relative standalone price of each performance obligation, which most often would represent the price at which the Company would sell similar goods or services separately.
S
tep 5 - Recognize revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied
The Company is required to assess whether control of a product or services promised under a contract is transferred to the customer at a point-in-time or over time as the product is being manufactured or the services are being provided. If the criteria in ASC 606, for recognizing revenue on an over time basis are not met, revenue must be recognized at the point-in-time determined by the Company at which its customer obtains control of a product or service.
The Company recognizes revenue for the majority of its contracts on an over time basis. This is primarily due to the fact that the Company does not have an alternative use for the end products it manufactures for its customers and has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit, for work in progress upon a customer’s cancellation of a contract for convenience. In certain circumstances, the Company recognizes over time because its customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company’s services or the Company’s customer controls the end product as the Company performs manufacturing services (continuous transfer of control). For these contracts, revenue is recognized on an over time basis using the cost-to-cost method (ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion) which the Company believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. At least 
95
% of the Company’s revenue is recognized on an over time basis, which is as products are manufactured or services are performed. Because of this, and the fact that there is no work in process or finished goods inventory associated with contracts for which revenue is recognized on an over-time basis, 
99
% or more of the Company’s inventory at the end of a given period is in the form of raw materials. For contracts for which revenue is required to be recognized at a point in time, the Company recognizes revenue when it has transferred control of the related goods, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of the goods to the customer. 
In our Defense and Aerospace division, we apply the cost-to-cost method for government contracts which requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs included in the total estimated costs at completion. Additionally, the Company evaluates whether contract modifications for claims have been approved and, if so, estimates the amount, if any, of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price of the contract.
Estimates of materials, labor and subcontractor costs expected to be incurred to satisfy a performance obligation are updated on a quarterly basis. These estimates consider costs incurred to date and estimated costs to be incurred over the 
55
Table of Contents
remaining expected period of performance to satisfy a performance obligation. There is inherent uncertainty in estimating the amount of costs that will be required to complete a contract. Factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in estimates include, among others, (1) the long-term duration of contracts, (2) the highly-complex nature of the products we manufacture, (3) the readiness of our customer’s design for manufacturing, (4) the cost and availability of purchased materials, (5) labor cost, availability and productivity, (6) subcontractor performance and (7) the risk of delayed performance/completion. Therefore, such estimates are reviewed each quarter by a group of employees that includes representatives from numerous functions such as engineering, materials, contracts, manufacturing, program management, finance and senior management. If a change in estimate is deemed necessary, the impact of the change is recognized in the period of change. Additionally, contract modifications for claims are assessed each quarter to determine whether the claims have been approved. If it is determined that a claim has been approved, the amount of the claim, if any, that can be included in transaction price is estimated considering a number of factors such as the length of time expected to lapse until uncertainty about the claim has been resolved and the extent to which our experience with claims for similar contracts has predictive value.
Contract Assets
A contract asset is recognized when the Company has recognized revenue, but has not issued an invoice to its customer for payment. Contract assets are classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets and transferred to accounts receivable when rights to payment become unconditional. Because of the Company’s short manufacturing cycle times, the transfer from contract assets to accounts receivable generally occurs within the next fiscal quarter.
Other
Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control of a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales.
The Company applies the following practical expedients or policy elections under ASC 606:
•
The promised amount of consideration under a contract is not adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component because, at inception of a contract, the Company expects the period between when a good or service is transferred to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will generally be one year or less.
•
The Company has elected to not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less, which is substantially all of the Company’s remaining performance obligations.
•
Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are not capitalized if the period over which such costs would be amortized to expense is less than one year.

Stock-based Compensation
. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which generally ranges from 
one year
 to 
four years
 and/or upon achievement of specified performance criteria. Stock-based compensation expense for time-based and performance-based restricted stock awards is valued at the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. During the requisite service period, performance-based restricted stock awards are monitored by management for probability of achievement of performance goals and if it becomes probable that the number of awarded shares that will vest is greater than or less than the previous estimate of the number of awarded shares that will vest, an adjustment to stock-based compensation expense will be recognized as a change in accounting estimate. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for market-based restricted stock units measured at fair value on the grant date using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The stock-based compensation expense for awards with market conditions will be recognized over the requisite service periods regardless of whether the market conditions are satisfied.
Income taxes.
 The Company estimates its income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates, including estimating exposures and making judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The carrying value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is based on the Company’s belief that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient future 
56
Table of Contents
taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria discussed above
.
The Company’s tax rate is dependent upon the geographic distribution of its worldwide income or losses, the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region, the availability of tax credits and carryforwards, including net operating losses, and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies.

The Company makes an assessment of whether each income tax position is “more likely than not” of being sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation, if any. For each income tax position that meets the “more likely than not” recognition threshold, the Company then assesses the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon effective settlement with the tax authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which will require the Company to disclose information about its reportable segment’s significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. The disclosure requirements are effective for the Company in fiscal 2025, and for interim periods within the Company's fiscal 2026, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2023-07 will have on its financial statement disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which will require the Company, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in its effective income tax rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company in fiscal 2026, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2023-09 will have on its financial statement disclosures.

As an electronics manufacturing services company, the Company primarily provides manufacturing and related services for products built to its customers’ unique specifications. Therefore, it is impracticable for the Company to provide revenue from external customers for each product and service it provides.
Changes in the Company’s estimates of transaction price and/or costs to complete result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to revenue and operating income. The impact of changes in estimates on revenue and operating income resulting from the application of the cost-to-cost method for recognizing revenue was as follows:

Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk
Fair Value Measurements
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair values of cash equivalents (representing 
23
% of cash and cash equivalents), accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate carrying value due to the short-term duration of these instruments. Additionally, the fair value of variable rate long-term debt approximates carrying value as of September 28, 2024. The Company’s cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The Company’s primary financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are deferred compensation plan assets and defined benefit plan assets, which are both measured using Level 1 inputs. See Note 15 “Employee Benefit Plans”. Other financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, which are both measured using Level 2 inputs. Interest rate swaps are valued based on a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates observable (Level 2) market inputs such as interest rate yield curves and credit spreads. For currency contracts, Level 2 inputs include foreign currency spot and forward rates and interest rates at commonly quoted intervals. Foreign exchange contracts were not material as of September 28, 2024 or September 30, 2023
.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Other non-financial assets, such as goodwill and other long-lived assets, are measured at fair value as of the date such assets are acquired or in the period an impairment is recorded.

Derivative Instruments
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
The Company is exposed to certain risks related to its ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed by using derivative instruments is foreign currency exchange risk.
Forward contracts on various foreign currencies are used to manage foreign currency risk associated with forecasted foreign currency transactions and certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. The Company’s primary foreign currency cash flows are in India, Mexico and China.
The Company had the following outstanding foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures:

The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain operational (“cash flow”) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures generally result from (1) forecasted non-functional currency sales and (2) forecasted non-functional currency materials, labor, overhead and other expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are generally one to two months in duration but, by policy, may be up to 
twelve months
 in duration. The amount of gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income on derivative instruments and the amount of gain or loss reclassified from AOCI into income were not material for any period presented herein and is included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income.
60
Table of Contents
The Company enters into short-term foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. These contracts have maturities of up to 
two months
 and are not designated as accounting hedges. Accordingly, these contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each period with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other expense, in the consolidated statements of income. The amount of gains or losses associated with these forward contracts was not material for any period presented herein. From an economic perspective, the objective of the Company’s hedging program is for gains and losses on forward contracts to substantially offset gains and losses on the underlying hedged items. In addition to the contracts disclosed in the table above, the Company has numerous contracts that have been closed from an economic and financial accounting perspective and will settle early in the first month of the following quarter. Since these offsetting contracts do not expose the Company to risk of fluctuations in exchange rates, these contracts have been excluded from the above table.
Interest Rate Risk
The Company enters into forward interest rate swap agreements with independent counterparties to partially hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in Secured Overnight Financing Rate benchmark interest rate (“SOFR”) associated with anticipated variable rate borrowings. These interest rate swaps have a maturity date of 
September 27, 2027
 and effectively convert a portion of the Company’s variable interest rate obligations to fixed interest rate obligations. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges under ASC Topic 815,
 Derivatives and Hedging
. Interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $
300
 million and $
650
 million were outstanding as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The aggregate effective interest rate of these swaps as of September 28, 2024 was approximately 
4.7
%. 
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with recognized financial institutions, both domestic and foreign. Cash and cash equivalents may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits, but may generally be redeemed upon demand. Periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions are performed and the Company attempts to limit its exposure with any one institution. One of the Company’s most significant credit risks is the ultimate realization of accounts receivable. This risk is mitigated by ongoing credit evaluations of, and frequent contact with, the Company’s customers, especially its most significant customers, thus enabling it to monitor changes in business operations and respond accordingly. The Company generally does not require collateral for sales on credit. The Company considers these concentrations of credit risks when estimating its allowance for doubtful accounts. Foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps are maintained with high quality counterparties to reduce the Company’s credit risk and are recorded on the Company’s balance sheets at fair value.
Sales to the Company’s ten largest customers represented 
47
% of net sales in 2024. Net sales from these customers are derived from multiple segments. The following table presents the percentage of total net sales to each significant customer that represented 10% or more of the Company’s net sales.

On 
September 27, 2022
 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $
800
 million revolving credit facility and a $
350
 million secured term loan (“Term Loan Due 2027”). Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from existing and/or new lenders, the Company may increase the revolving commitment up to an additional $
200
 million. Costs incurred in connection with Credit Agreement of $
3
 million are classified as long-term debt and are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the Term Loan Due 2027 using the effective interest method.
The Term Loan Due 2027 was fully drawn on the Closing Date and the proceeds were used to repay the term loan issued under the Company’s prior credit agreement. Upon repayment, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $
1
 million consisting of a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs under such prior agreement. 
Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either the SOFR or a base rate, in each case plus a spread determined based on the Company’s credit rating. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to base rate loans and at the end of an interest period (and at three month intervals if the interest period exceeds three months) in the case of SOFR loans. The outstanding principal amount of all loans under the Credit Agreement, including the Term Loan Due 2027, together with accrued and unpaid interest, is due on 
September 27, 2027
. The Company is required to repay a portion of the principal amount of the Term Loan Due 2027 equal to 
1.25
% of the principal in quarterly installments.
Certain of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries are guarantors in respect of the Credit Agreement. The Company and the subsidiary guarantors’ obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of their respective assets (excluding real property), including cash, accounts receivable and the shares of certain Company subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.
As of September 28, 2024, 
no
 borrowings and $
14
 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement, under which $
786
 million was available to borrow. There were 
no
 borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2023.
Short-term Borrowing Facilities

Certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company had a total of $
71
 million of short-term borrowing facilities available, under which 
no
 borrowings were outstanding as of September 28, 2024. Some of these facilities expire at various dates through 
the second quarter of 2025
 and are expected to be renewed. 
The Company had $
8
 million of short-term borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and 
no
 short-term borrowings outstanding as of September 28, 2024.

Debt Covenants
The Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, namely a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, in both cases measured on the basis of a trailing 12-month look-back period. In addition, the Company's debt agreements contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, making investments and other restricted payments, selling assets and paying dividends, subject to certain exceptions. Finally, the agreements also include covenants that require us to file quarterly and annual financial statements with the SEC on a timely basis. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 28, 2024.

Accounts Receivable Sale Program
Under the sale of accounts receivable programs, the Company sells its entire interest in an accounts receivable for 
100
% of face value, less a discount. For the years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company sold approximately $
1.1
 billion and approximately $
2.6
 billion, respectively, of accounts receivable under these programs. Upon sale, these receivables are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and cash received is presented as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Discounts on sold receivables were $
8
 million and $
19
 million for the years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and were recorded in other expense, in the consolidated statements of income. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, $
34
 million and $
162
 million, respectively, of accounts receivable sold under the RPA and subject to servicing by the Company remained outstanding and had not yet been collected. The Company’s sole risk with respect to receivables it services is with respect to commercial disputes regarding such receivables. Commercial disputes include billing errors, returns and similar matters. To date, the Company has not been required to repurchase any receivable it has sold due to a commercial dispute. Additionally, the Company is required to remit amounts collected as a servicer under the RPA on a weekly basis to the financial institutions that purchased the receivables. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, $
3
 million and $
33
 million, respectively, had been collected but not yet remitted. This amount is classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Note 9. 
Contingencies
From time to time, the Company is a party to litigation, claims and other contingencies, including environmental, regulatory and employee matters and examinations and investigations by governmental agencies, which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with ASC Topic 450, 
Contingencies,
 or other applicable accounting standards. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had reserves of $
39
 million and $
34
 million, respectively, for environmental matters, warranty, litigation and other contingencies (excluding reserves for uncertain tax positions), which the Company believes are adequate. However, there can be no assurance that the Company’s reserves will be sufficient to settle these contingencies. Such reserves are included in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
Legal Proceedings
Environmental Matters
The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and administrative orders concerning environmental protection, including those addressing the discharge of pollutants into the environment, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the materials used in products, and the recycling, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. 
In June 2008, the Company was named by the Orange County Water District in a suit alleging that a predecessor company’s actions at a plant the Company sold in 1998 contributed to polluted groundwater managed by the plaintiff. The complaint seeks recovery of compensatory and other damages, as well as declaratory relief, for the payment of costs necessary to investigate, monitor, remediate, abate and contain contamination of groundwater. In April 2013, all claims against the Company were dismissed. The plaintiff appealed this dismissal and the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment in August 2017, remanding the case back to the Superior Court of California for trial. The trial against the Company and several other defendants commenced in April 2021 and the submission of evidence concluded in May 2022. On April 3, 2023, the court published a statement of decision finding the Company and other remaining defendants liable for certain past investigation costs incurred by the plaintiff. Subsequent proceedings to assess the Company’s and other defendants’ liability for the plaintiff’s future remediation and other costs, including attorneys’ fees, were expected. However, without admitting any liability, in August 2024, the Company and plaintiff agreed to settle this matter and all pending litigation in exchange for the Company’s payment to the plaintiff of $
3
 million.

Other Matters
In December 2019, the Company sued a former customer, 
Dialight plc
 (“Dialight”), in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to collect unpaid accounts receivable and net obsolete inventory obligations now totaling $
9
 million (exclusive of interest and attorneys’ fees). On the same day the Company filed its suit, Dialight commenced its own action in the same court. 
Dialight
 alleged that the Company fraudulently misrepresented its capabilities to induce Dialight to enter into a Manufacturing Services Agreement (“MSA”) and then allegedly committed multiple, willful breaches of contract when performing under the MSA. A trial took place in September 2024 and the jury awarded the Company $
9
 million on its claims and rejected Dialight’s claims for fraudulent inducement and willful breach of contract and awarded Dialight $
1
 million for breach of contract. The parties filed post-trial motions in October 2024, including a motion by the Company for prejudgment interest and its costs and expenses of the suit, and a motion by Dialight for pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, its costs and expenses of the suit and for a new trial. A decision resolving these motions is expected in the first calendar quarter of 2025. The Company will continue to prosecute vigorously its claims against Dialight and, ultimately, to defend on appeal and enforce any resulting judgment. 
In May 2023, Sanmina Corporation and its SCI Technology, Inc. subsidiary (“SCI”) received Civil Investigative Demands (“CIDs”) from the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) pursuant to the civil False Claims Act (“FCA”). The stated purpose of the CIDs—a form of subpoena requiring responses to written interrogatories and the production of documents relating to certain contracts, projects, proposals and business activities of SCI going back to 2010—is to determine whether there is or has been a violation of the FCA with respect to the provision of products and services to the government. These CIDs supplement several CIDs relating to the same subject matter served upon SCI and certain current and former SCI and Sanmina Corporation employees beginning in August 2020, pursuant to which SCI produced documents and information and certain of the current and former employees provided oral testimony. Sanmina and SCI cooperated with the DOJ investigation. On May 13, 2024, the Company learned that 
United States of America ex rel. Carl R. Eckert v. SCI Technology, Inc. et al. 
(the “Eckert Qui Tam Suit”) had been filed under seal in June 2020, and is now unsealed. On May 13, 2024, the Company also learned that the DOJ had filed a notice in the Eckert Qui Tam Suit stating that, while its investigation would continue, it was declining to intervene at the current time. The Eckert Qui Tam Suit, filed by a former SCI employee, alleges on behalf of the United States, 16 FCA counts that relate substantially to the same contracts and issues that the DOJ has investigated over the past four years, including making false certifications under the Truth in Negotiations Act and Cost Accounting Standards, submitting false cost and pricing data, fraudulently inducing the government to award contracts and violations of the Service Contract Act. The complaint alleges such claimed violations defrauded the government in an amount approximating $
100
 million. The complaint seeks, on behalf of the government, treble damages, civil penalties and interest payable thereon. On October 7, 2024, Sanmina and SCI filed a motion to dismiss the Eckert Qui Tam Suit. A decision on the motion is expected in the first half of calendar 2025. Sanmina Corporation and SCI intend to defend vigorously against the claims made in the Eckert Qui Tam Suit. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the Eckert Qui Tam Suit, although a loss is currently not considered to be probable or estimable. 
On November 14, 2023, employee Gerardo Ramirez, filed two lawsuits against the Company in the Alameda County Superior Court (together, the “Ramirez Cases”). The first, a putative class action, alleges violations of various California Labor Code and Wage Order requirements, including provisions governing overtime, meal and rest periods, minimum wage requirements, payment of wages during employment, wage statements, payroll records, and reimbursement of business expenses. The class action complaint seeks certification of a class of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company within the State of California at any time between March 1, 2021 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution, attorneys’ fees, pre-judgment interest, and costs of suit. The second action, a complaint under California’s Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), alleges substantially similar violations and a violation of the provision governing payment of final wages and seeks penalties individually and on behalf of the State of California and other “aggrieved employees,” along with attorneys’ fees and costs. On May 16, 2024 and June 14, 2024, former employee Carlos Lobatos filed class and PAGA actions in the Santa Clara County Superior Court (the “Lobatos Cases”) alleging violations substantially similar to the violations in the Ramirez Cases, and, in the case of the Lobatos PAGA action, additional violations related to sick leave, suitable rest facilities, seating, failure to retain and provide employment and payroll records, reporting time pay, day of rest rules, payroll deductions, paid time off, and various unlawful employment practices. The Lobatos class action complaint seeks certification of a class of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company (directly or via a staffing agency) within the State of California at any time between May 16, 2020 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution, attorneys’ fees, pre-judgment interest, and costs of suit. On August 12, 2024, former employee Mando Gomez filed a class and PAGA action in the Alameda County Superior Court (the “Gomez Case”) alleging violations substantially similar to the violations in the Ramirez Cases. The Gomez Case seeks certification of a class of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company (directly or via a staffing agency) within the State of California at any time between August 12, 2020 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution,

attorneys’ fees, pre-judgment interest, and costs of suit. On September 20, 2024, former employee Frank J. Leon Guerrero filed a class action in the Alameda County Superior Court (the “Guerrero Case”) alleging violations substantially similar to the violations in the Ramirez Cases. The Guerrero Case seeks certification of several classes comprised of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company (directly or via a staffing agency) within the State of California at any time between September 20, 2020 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution, attorneys’ fees, pre- and post-judgment interest, and costs of suit. The Company expects the Lobatos Cases, the Gomez Case, and the Guerrero Case to be related to or consolidated with the Ramirez Cases and intends to defend all such cases vigorously. 
For each of the pending matters noted above, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss at this time.
In addition, from time to time, the Company may become involved in routine legal proceedings, demands, claims, threatened litigation and regulatory inquiries and investigations that arise in the normal course of our business. The Company records liabilities for such matters when a loss becomes probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The Company's provision for income taxes for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
80
 million (
25
% of income before taxes), $
85
 million (
21
% of income before taxes) and $
62
 million (
20
% of income before taxes), respectively. 
The effective tax rate for 2024 was higher than the expected U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at rates higher than the U.S. statutory rate, state taxes, and unfavorable permanent differences. The effective tax rates for 2023 and 2022 were lower than the expected U.S. statutory rate of 
21
% primarily due to a $
12
 million and $
16
 million tax benefit, respectively, resulting from the release of certain foreign tax reserves due to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations.

A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information and other factors, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company regularly assesses its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial results. Significant judgment is required in assessing the Company’s ability to generate revenue, gross profit, operating income and jurisdictional taxable income in future periods. The Company’s valuation allowance as of September 28, 2024 relates primarily to foreign net operating losses, except for $
13
 million related to U.S. state net operating losses.
The Company provides deferred tax liabilities for the tax consequences associated with the undistributed earnings that are expected to be repatriated to the subsidiaries' parent unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. As of September 28, 2024, income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for approximately $
438
 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of several non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside of the U.S. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.

Table of Contents
As of September 28, 2024, the Company has cumulative net operating loss carryforwards for state and foreign tax purposes of $
255
 million and $
446
 million, respectively, and 
none
 for federal tax. The state net operating loss carryforwards begin expiring in fiscal year 2025 and expire at various dates through 
September 26, 2043
. Certain foreign net operating losses will begin expiring in 2025. However, the majority of foreign net operating losses carryforward indefinitely. As of September 28, 2024, the Company has federal tax credits of $
22
 million that expire between 2031 and 2044. There are certain restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an “ownership change” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. The utilization of certain net operating losses may be restricted due to changes in ownership and business operations.

The Company had reserves of $
8
 million as of each of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 for the payment of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits. During 2024, the Company recognized an income tax benefit for interest and penalties of $
1
 million due to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations compared to an income tax benefit of $
4
 million in 2023. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Should the Company be able to ultimately recognize all of these uncertain tax positions, it would result in a benefit to net income of $
36
 million in 2024. 
The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. 
As a result of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for fiscal 2008 through 2010, the Company received a Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) on November 17, 2023 asserting an underpayment of tax of approximately $
8
 million for fiscal 2009. The asserted underpayment results from the IRS’s proposed disallowance of a $
503
 million worthless stock deduction in fiscal 2009. Such disallowance, if upheld, would reduce the Company’s available net operating loss carryforwards and result in additional tax and interest attributable to fiscal 2021 and later years, which could be material. The Company disagrees with the IRS’s position as asserted in the RAR and is vigorously contesting this matter through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. The Company does not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with any certainty the timing of such resolution. Although the final resolution of this matter remains 
68
Table of Contents
uncertain, the Company continues to believe that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax position will be sustained. However, an unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Additionally, the Company is being audited by various state tax agencies and certain foreign countries. To the extent the final tax liabilities are different from the amounts accrued, the increases or decreases would be recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of income. Although the Company believes that the resolution of these audits will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, the outcome is subject to uncertainty.
In general, the Company is no longer subject to United States federal or state income tax examinations for years before 2003, and to foreign examinations for years prior to 2006 in its major foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next twelve months by approximately $
8
 million related to payments, the resolution of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations. In addition, there could be a corresponding decrease in accrued interest and penalties of approximately $
2
 million.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. Various countries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax and where enacted, the rules begin to be effective for the Company in fiscal 2025. The Pillar Two rules are considered an alternative minimum tax and therefore deferred taxes would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated effects of the future minimum tax. The adoption and effective dates of these rules may vary by country and could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may adversely affect the Company’s provision for income taxes. The Company does not expect any material impact from these tax law changes in fiscal 2025.

Stockholders' Equity
The Company's 2009 Stock Plan (“2009 Plan”) expired as to future grants on January 26, 2019. Although the 2009 Plan expired, it will continue to govern all awards granted under it prior to its expiration date. On March 11, 2019, the Company's stockholders approved the Company’s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan”) and the reservation of 
4
 million shares of common stock for issuance thereunder, plus any shares subject to stock options or similar awards granted under the 2009 Plan that expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full and shares issued pursuant to awards granted that are forfeited by the Company.
As of September 28, 2024, an aggregate of 
5
 million shares were authorized for future issuance under the Company’s stock plans, of which 
3
 million of such shares were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and delivery of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units and 
2
 million shares of common stock were available for future grant. Awards other than stock options reduce common stock available for grant by 1.36 shares for every share of common stock subject to such an award. Awards under the 2019 Plan and 2009 Plan that expire or are cancelled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. The 2019 Plan will expire as to future grants in 
December 2028

Stock Repurchase Program
During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased 
4.0
 million shares, 
1.6
 million shares and 
8.0
 million shares of its common stock for $
227
 million, $
84
 million and $
317
 million (including commissions), respectively, under stock repurchase programs authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors. These programs have no expiration dates and the timing of repurchases will depend upon capital needs to support the growth of the Company’s business, market conditions and other factors. Although stock repurchases are intended to increase stockholder value, they also reduce the Company’s liquidity. As of September 28, 2024, an aggregate of $
53
 million remains available under these programs.
In addition to the repurchases discussed above, the Company withheld 
0.5
 million, 
0.4
 million and 
0.4
 million shares of its common stock during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units. The Company paid $
26
 million, $
23
 million and $
14
 million, respectively, to applicable tax authorities in connection with these repurchases.

The Company grants restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock units with performance conditions (“PSUs”) primarily to executive officers, directors and certain employees. These units vest over periods ranging from 
one year
 to 
four years
 and/or upon achievement of specified performance criteria, with associated compensation expense recognized ratably over the vesting period. 
Generally, the Company’s PSUs vest contingent on achievement of cumulative non-GAAP earnings per share measured over three fiscal years. If a minimum threshold is not achieved during the measurement period, the PSUs will be cancelled. If a minimum threshold is achieved or exceeded, the number of shares of common stock that will be issued will range from 
70
% to 
130
% of the number of PSUs granted, depending on the extent of performance. Additionally, for certain grants, the number of shares that vest may be adjusted up or down by up to 
15
% based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to that of its peer group over this same period.

Note 15. 
Employee Benefit Plans
The Company has various defined contribution retirement plans that cover the majority of its domestic employees. These retirement plans permit participants to elect to have contributions made to the retirement plans in the form of salary deferrals. Under these retirement plans, the Company may match a portion of employee contributions. Amounts contributed by the Company were not material for any period presented herein.

The Company sponsors a deferred compensation plan for eligible employees that allows participants to defer payment of all or part of their compensation. Deferrals under this plan were immaterial. Assets associated with these plans were $
47
 million and $
38
 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Liabilities associated with these plans were $
47
 million and $
38
 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. These amounts are recorded in other non-current assets and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Defined benefit plans covering certain employees in the United States and Canada were frozen in 2001. During 2022, the Board of Directors approved the termination of the Company's frozen U.S. defined benefit plan, effective July 3, 2022. In connection with this termination, the Company purchased a group annuity contract for $
6
 million during 2022 that provides for the administration of future payments to eligible plan participants. In addition, the Company recorded a pension settlement charge of $
2
 million during 2022, which includes the reclassification of unrecognized pension losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to other expense on the consolidated statements of income.

The Company provides defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries. The assumptions used for calculating the pension benefit obligations for non-U.S. plans depend on the local economic environment and regulations. The measurement date for the Company's defined benefit plans is September 28, 2024.

The Company’s investment strategy is designed to help ensure that sufficient pension assets are available to pay benefits as they become due. Plan assets are invested in mutual funds that are valued using the net asset value that is quoted in active markets (Level 1 input). These plans are managed consistent with regulations or market practices of the country in which the assets are invested. As of September 28, 2024, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk related to pension plan assets. All other amounts and assumptions were not material for any period presented herein.

Strategic Transactions
India Joint Venture
In 2023, the Company entered into a joint venture transaction pursuant to which RSBVL acquired 
50.1
% of the outstanding shares of SIPL, the Company’s existing Indian manufacturing entity for $
216
 million of cash. The remaining 
49.9
% is held by the Company. 
In accordance with ASC Topic 810, 
Consolidation 
(“ASC 810”), the Company is required to consolidate entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. The Company determined the voting interest model was applicable under ASC 810 and concluded that, despite not having a majority ownership interest, the Company has a controlling financial interest in SIPL through the management services contract. Therefore, the Company has, by contract, the unilateral ability to control the significant decisions made in the ordinary course of SIPL’s business. Because the Company has a controlling financial interest in SIPL, it consolidates SIPL. However, the Company periodically assesses whether any changes in facts and circumstances have occurred that could require the Company to deconsolidate SIPL.
SIPL’s cash and cash equivalents balance of $
200
 million as of September 28, 2024 is not available for general corporate purposes and must be retained in SIPL to fund its operations.

Controls and Procedures
(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that their objectives are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of disclosure controls and procedures must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all disclosure control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024. Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 28, 2024 because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below.
(b)

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the material weaknesses described herein existed as of September 28, 2024. As a result, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 28, 2024 based on the criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the COSO.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis.
We identified the following material weaknesses as of September 28, 2024:
As previously reported, we identified material weaknesses in the control environment at one of our divisions due to this division maintaining an inappropriate tone at the top. Specifically, division management did not sufficiently promote, monitor or enforce appropriate accounting policies and procedures, thereby resulting in inappropriate and unsupported adjustments to the quarterly contract cost estimate process. Additionally, we did not maintain a sufficient complement of finance personnel at the division with an appropriate level of expertise, knowledge and training in internal control over financial reporting commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. These material weaknesses contributed to an additional material weakness that the division did not design and maintain effective controls over the quarterly contract estimate review process, which lead to the failure to timely and appropriately record adjustments to quarterly estimates.
These material weaknesses resulted in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended October 3, 2020, October 2, 2021 and October 1, 2022 and for the quarterly fiscal periods included in such fiscal years and for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022. These material weaknesses also resulted in immaterial misstatements of our consolidated financial statements for the quarterly fiscal periods as of and for the periods ended April 1, 2023, July 1, 2023, September 30, 2023, June 29, 2024 and September 28, 2024. Additionally, each of these material weaknesses could result in misstatements of the accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.  
In connection with our financial reporting process for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2024, we identified an additional material weakness as the Company did not design and maintain effective controls to properly support and account for the transfer of control to its customers of certain raw materials inventory. This material weakness resulted in adjustments and immaterial misstatements to inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 
75
Table of Contents
2023, respectively. Additionally, this material weakness could result in misstatements of the aforementioned accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under Item 8.
(c)

Status of Remediation of Material Weaknesses
Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weaknesses
Management plans to remediate the material weaknesses described above primarily by ensuring that relevant program management and finance personnel possess sufficient knowledge and experience and are sufficiently engaged to identify, escalate and drive closure of matters that could impact estimated long-term customer program costs and/or require the recording of additional expenses in the Company’s financial statements.
To date, management undertook the following remedial actions in conjunction with the above plan:
•
Removed internal control over financial reporting responsibilities and representation from designated individuals and added new individuals for these responsibilities and representations.
•
Conducted training sessions for all employees involved in the estimate at completion (“EAC”) process on ethics, reporting and fraud, as well as the importance of EACs to financial reporting.
•
Implemented a certification process whereby a select group of employees with key roles in the EAC and financial reporting processes are required to make certain representations about the completeness and accuracy of EACs, as well as a representation that they are not aware of any improprieties in the accounting or control functions.  
•
Realigned reporting lines whereby program financial analysts report directly to the finance organization.
•
Hired a President to lead the division and added several new employees to the finance department of the division.
•
Engaged third-party consultants with extensive Aerospace and Defense experience and expertise to perform a comprehensive review of the division’s accounting and reporting functions, including performing an evaluation of the division’s policies and procedures.
These actions represent significant progress in addressing the material weaknesses. We plan to fully implement and operate the redesigned processes and procedures in the upcoming fiscal year and to begin testing the enhanced controls starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The material weaknesses will not be considered formally remediated until these controls have operated effectively for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively. 
Remediation Plan for the Material Weakness Identified in Fiscal 2024
Management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee, intends to remediate the material weakness described above primarily by (i) updating the relevant accounting policy and procedures to be more prescriptive, (ii) enhancing the review processes applicable to evaluating whether the transfer of control of inventories has occurred or whether payments received from customers should be reported as a liability, (iii) establishing controls over the preparation and review of customer level inventory reconciliations, and (iv) training of sales, operations and finance personnel responsible for administering and accounting for customer-purchased inventory arrangements.
(d)

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
