RISK MANA
GEMENT

All financial institutions must manage and control a variety of business risks that can significantly affect their financial performance. Our Board of Directors (“Board”) and executive management team have overall and ultimate responsibility for management of these risks, which they carry out through committees with specific and well-defined risk management functions. The Risk Management Program that we have adopted seeks to implement the proper control and management of key risk factors inherent in the operation of the Company and the Bank. Some of the key risks that we must manage are credit risks, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, market risks, transaction risk, compliance risk, strategic risk (including reputation risk), legal risk, and cybersecurity risk. These specific risk factors are not mutually exclusive. It is recognized that any product or service offered by us may expose the Bank to one or more of these risks. Our Risk Management Committee and Risk Management Division monitor these risks to minimize exposure to the Company. The Board and its committees work closely with management in overseeing risk. Each Board committee receives reports and information regarding risk issues directly from management.

Credit Risk Management

Loans represent the largest component of assets on our balance sheet and their related credit risk is among the most significant risks we manage. We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk is found in all activities where success depends on a counter party, issuer, or borrower performance. Credit risk arises through the extension of loans and leases, certain securities, and letters of credit.

Natural disasters, such as storms, earthquakes, drought and other weather conditions, effects of pandemics, and problems related to possible climate changes, social unrest or protest, may from time-to-time cause or create the risk of damage to facilities, buildings, property or other assets of Bank customers, borrowers or municipal debt issuers. This could in turn affect their financial condition or results of operations and as a consequence their ability or capacity to repay debt or fulfill other obligations to the Bank.

Credit risk in the investment portfolio and correspondent bank accounts is in part addressed through defined limits in the Company’s policy statements. In addition, certain securities carry insurance to enhance the credit quality of the bond. Limitations on industry concentration, aggregate customer borrowings, geographic boundaries and standards on loan quality also are designed to reduce loan credit risk. Senior Management, Directors’ Committees, and the Board are provided with information to appropriately identify, measure, control and monitor the credit risk of the Company.

The Bank’s loan policy is updated annually and approved by the Board. It prescribes underwriting guidelines and procedures for all loan categories in which the Bank participates to establish risk tolerance and parameters that are communicated throughout the Bank to ensure consistent and uniform lending practices. The underwriting guidelines include, among other things, approval limitation and hierarchy, documentation standards, loan-to-value limits, debt coverage ratio, overall credit-worthiness of the borrower, guarantor support, etc. All loan requests considered by the Bank should be for a clearly defined legitimate purpose with a determinable primary source, as well as alternate sources of repayment. All loans should be supported by appropriate documentation including, current financial statements, credit reports, collateral information, guarantor asset verification, tax returns, title reports, appraisals (where appropriate), and other documents of quality that will support the credit.

The major lending categories are commercial and industrial loans, SBA loans, owner-occupied and non owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, construction loans, dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans, residential real estate loans, and various consumer loan products. Loans underwritten to borrowers within these diverse categories require underwriting and documentation suited to the unique characteristics and inherent risks involved.

Commercial and industrial loans require credit structures that are tailored to the specific purpose of the business loan, involving a thorough analysis of the borrower’s business, cash flow, collateral, industry risks, economic risks, credit, character, and guarantor support. Owner-occupied real estate loans are primarily based upon the capacity and stability of the cash flow generated by the occupying business and the market value of the collateral, among other things. Non owner-occupied real estate is typically underwritten to the income produced by the subject property and many considerations unique to the various types of property (i.e. office, retail, warehouse, shopping center, medical, etc.), as well as, the financial support provided by sponsors in recourse transactions. Construction loans will often depend on the specific characteristics of the project, the market for the specific development, real estate values, and the equity and financial strength of the sponsors. Dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans are largely predicated on the revenue cycles and demand for milk and crops, commodity prices, collateral values of herd, feed, and income-producing dairies or croplands, and the financial support of the

70

guarantors. Underwriting of residential real estate and consumer loans are generally driven by personal income and debt service capacity, credit history and scores, and collateral values.

SBA loans require credit structures that conform to the various requirements of the SBA programs specific to the type of loan request and the Bank’s loan policy as it relates to these loans. The SBA 7(a) loans are similar to the commercial and industrial loans that are tailored to the specific purpose of the business loan, involving a thorough analysis of the borrower’s business, cash flow, collateral, industry risks, economic risks, credit, character, and guarantor support for both the Bank and the SBA. Once granted, the SBA 7(a) loans require the Bank to follow SBA servicing guidelines to maintain the SBA guaranty which typically ranges from 75% to 90% depending on the type of 7(a) loan. SBA 504 loans are similar to the Bank’s Owner-occupied real estate loans. As such they are primarily based upon the capacity and stability of the cash flow generated by the occupying business and the market value of the collateral, among other things. When the Bank funds an SBA 504 transaction, which includes the 50% - 65% first trust deed loan and the 25% - 40% second trust deed loan, the initial risk is centered in completing the SBA’s requirements to provide for the payoff of the second trust deed loan from the subordinated debenture. Once the 504 second is paid off, the remaining first trust deed loan is then managed under the same requirements applied to the Bank’s owner-occupied commercial real estate loans. It should be noted that both the SBA 7(a) and 504 programs provide loans for commercial real estate acquisition. However, the terms and advances rates available under the 7(a) program are outside of the Bank’s standard loan programs and risk profile and therefore require a credit enhancement in the form of the SBA guaranty. Additionally, the interest rates for the 7(a) program are typically variable and can adjust as often as monthly with quarterly adjustment the most typical. SBA 504 loan interest rates for the first trust deed loan are at the Bank’s discretion and subject to competitive pressures from other banks.

Implicit in lending activities is the risk that losses will occur and that the amount of such losses will vary over time. Consequently, we maintain an Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”) by charging a provision for credit losses to earnings. Loans determined to be losses are charged against the allowance for credit losses. In this regard, it is important to note that the Bank’s practice with regard to these loans, including modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, is to generally charge off any loss amount against the ACL upon evaluating the loan at the time a probable loss becomes recognized. As such, the Bank’s specific allowance for loans, including modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, is relatively low since any known loss amount will generally have been charged off.

Central to our credit risk management is its loan risk rating system. The originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating, which is reviewed and possibly changed by credit management. The risk rating is based primarily on an analysis of each borrower’s financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends. Credit approvals are made based upon our evaluation of the inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit management personnel. Credits are monitored by line and credit management personnel for deterioration in a borrower’s financial condition, which would impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract. Risk ratings may be adjusted as necessary.

Loans are risk rated into the following categories: Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss. Each of these groups is assessed and appropriate amounts used in determining the adequacy of our ACL. Nonperforming and Doubtful loans are analyzed on an individual basis for allowance amounts. The other categories have formulae used to determine the needed allowance amount.

The Company obtains a semi-annual independent credit review by engaging an outside party to review a sample of our loans and leases. The primary purpose of this review is to evaluate our existing loan ratings.

Refer to additional discussion concerning loans, nonperforming assets, allowance for credit losses and related tables under the Analysis of Financial Condition contained herein.

Transaction Risk

Transaction risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from problems in service, activity or product delivery. This risk is significant within any bank and is interconnected with other risk categories in most activities throughout the Company. Transaction risk is a function of internal controls, information systems, associate integrity, and operating processes. Transaction risk is also referred to as operating or operational risk. It arises daily throughout the Company as transactions are processed. It pervades all divisions, departments and centers and is inherent in all products and services we offer.

Operational risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational losses result from internal or external fraud, employment practices and workplace safety, failure to meet professional obligations involving customers, products, and business practices, damage to physical assets, business disruption and systems failures, and failures in execution, delivery, and process management.

In general, transaction risk is defined as high, medium or low by the Company. The audit plan ensures that high risk areas are reviewed annually. We utilize internal auditors and independent audit firms to test key controls of operational processes and to audit information systems, compliance management programs, loan credit reviews and trust services.

The key to monitoring transaction risk is in the design, documentation and implementation of well-defined procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls, and that the objectives of these controls have been met.

Compliance Risk Management

Compliance risk (also known as Regulatory risk) is the risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of, or non-conformance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards. Compliance risk also arises in situations where the laws or rules governing certain products or activities of the Bank’s customers, vendors or business partners may be ambiguous or untested. Compliance risk exposes us to fines, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. Compliance risk can also lead to a diminished reputation, reduced business value, limited business opportunities, lessened expansion potential, and lack of contract enforceability. The Company utilizes independent compliance audits as a means of assessing the effectiveness and identifying weaknesses in the compliance program.

There is no single or primary source of compliance risk. It is inherent in every activity. Frequently, it blends into operational risk and transaction risk. A portion of this risk is sometimes referred to as legal risk. This is not limited solely to risk from failure to comply with consumer protection laws; it encompasses all laws, as well as prudent ethical standards and contractual obligations. It also includes the exposure to litigation from all aspects of banking, traditional and non-traditional.

Our Risk Management Policy and Program and the Code of Ethical Conduct are cornerstones for controlling compliance risk. An integral part of controlling this risk is the proper training of associates. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for developing and executing a comprehensive compliance training program. The Chief Risk Officer, in consultation with our internal and external legal counsel, seeks to provide our associates with adequate training commensurate to their job functions to ensure compliance with banking laws and regulations.

Our Risk Management Policy and Program includes a risk-based audit program aimed at identifying internal control deficiencies and weaknesses. The Compliance Management Program includes a monitoring process to address external and internal risks, including regulatory change management, the evolving products and services, and strategies of the front-line units and control functions. Additionally, in-depth audits are performed by our internal audit department under the direction of our Chief Audit Executive and supplemented by independent external firms. Annually, an Audit Plan for the Company is developed and presented for approval to the Audit Committee of the Board.

The Risk Management Division conducts periodic monitoring of our compliance efforts with a special focus on business and control functions, assessing the inherent compliance risk of activities and the effectiveness of controls, and identifying control weaknesses that are to be strengthened or enhanced. Any material exceptions identified are brought forward to the appropriate department head, and appropriate management and board committees. This reporting provides an independent view of compliance risk across the company, and supports transparent communication and management awareness of compliance risk.

We recognize that customer complaints can often identify weaknesses in our compliance program which could expose us to risk. Therefore, we attempt to ensure that all complaints are given prompt attention. Our Compliance

72

Management Policy and Program include provisions on how customer complaints are to be addressed. The Chief Risk Officer reviews formal complaints to determine if a significant compliance risk exists and communicates those findings to the Compliance Management and Risk Management Committees.

Strategic Risk

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from adverse decisions or improper implementation of strategic decisions. This risk is a function of the compatibility between an organization’s goals, the resources deployed against those goals and the quality of implementation.

Strategic risks are identified as part of the strategic planning process. Strategic planning sessions, with members of the Board of Directors, Executive Leadership, and Senior Leadership are held annually. The strategic review consists of results of strategic initiatives, an assessment of the economic outlook, competitive analysis, and an industry outlook, including a legislative and regulatory review.

Reputation risk is the risk to capital and earnings arising from negative public opinion. This affects the Bank’s ability to establish new relationships or services or continue servicing existing relationships. It can expose the Bank to litigation and, in some instances, financial loss. Reputation risk is inherent in all banking activities and requires management to exercise an abundance of caution in dealing with customers, counterparties, correspondence, investors, and the community. In addition, threats to the Bank’s reputation may result from negative publicity regarding matters such as unethical or deceptive business practices, violations of laws or regulations, regulatory enforcement actions, high profile litigation, or poor financial performance.

Cybersecurity Risk

Cybersecurity and fraud risk refers to the risk of failures, interruptions of services, or breaches of security with respect to the Company’s or the Bank’s communication, information, operations, devices, financial control, customer internet banking, customer information, email, data processing systems, or other bank or third party applications. The ability of the Company’s customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches. In addition, the Company and the Bank rely primarily on third party providers to develop, manage, maintain and protect our systems and applications. Any such failures, interruptions or fraud or security breaches, depending on the scope, duration, affected system(s) or customers(s), could expose the Company and/or the Bank to financial loss, reputation damage, litigation, or regulatory action. We continue to invest in technologies and training to protect our associates, our customers and our assets. While we have implemented various detective and preventative measures which seek to protect our Company, our customers’ information and the Bank from the risk of fraud, data security breaches or service interruptions, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in preventing potential breaches or losses for us or our customers.

73

ASSET/LIABILITY AND MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity and Cash Flow

The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet our financial obligations when they come due without incurring unnecessary cost or risk, or causing a disruption to our normal operating activities. This includes the ability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources, accommodating loan demand and growth, funding investments, repurchasing securities, paying creditors as necessary, and other operating or capital needs.

We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and economic conditions, individual customer funding needs, as well as current and planned business activities. Management has an Asset/Liability Committee that meets monthly. This committee analyzes the cash flows from loans, investments, deposits and borrowings, as well as the input assumptions and results from various models. In addition, the Company has a Balance Sheet Management Committee of the Board of Directors that meets at least quarterly to review the Company’s balance sheet and liquidity position. This committee provides oversight to the balance sheet and liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines for the approval of our Board of Directors, and courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity needs.

In general, our liquidity is managed daily by controlling the level of liquid assets as well as the use of funds provided by the cash flow from the investment portfolio, loan demand, deposit fluctuations, and borrowings. Our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash equivalents in excess of minimum levels needed to fulfill normal business operations, short-term investment securities, and other anticipated near term cash flows from investments. In addition to on balance sheet liquidity, we have significant off-balance sheet sources of liquidity. To meet unexpected demands, lines of credit are maintained with correspondent banks, the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve, although availability under these lines of credit are subject to certain conditions. In addition to having more than $200 million of cash on the balance sheet at December 31, 2024, we had substantial sources of off-balance sheet liquidity. These sources of available liquidity include $4.2 billion of secured and unused capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank, $1.1 billion of secured unused borrowing capacity at the Fed’s discount window, more than $183 million of unpledged AFS securities that could be pledged at the discount window and $305 million of unsecured lines of credit. We can also obtain additional liquidity from deposit growth by utilizing state and national wholesale markets.

Our primary sources and uses of funds for the Company are deposits, customer repurchase agreements and loans. Total deposits and customer repos of $12.21 billion at December 31, 2024 increased $505.0 million, or 4.31%, over total deposits and customer repos of $11.71 billion at December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, total borrowings, consisted of $0.50 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances, at an average cost of approximately 4.6%. Our deposit levels and cost of deposits may fluctuate from period-to-period due to a variety of factors, including the stability of our deposit base, prevailing interest rates, and market conditions. As most of our business customers need to operate with more than $250,000 in their operating account, we have a significant percentage of deposits that are uninsured. At December 31, 2024, our deposits and customer repurchase agreements that are neither collateralized nor insured were approximately $5.5 billion, or 45% of our total deposits and customer repos.

In addition to the decrease in borrowings during 2024, we shrank our investment portfolio by not reinvesting the cashflows generated by our investments during 2024, as well as sales of securities exceeding purchases during the year. Our total investment portfolio declined by $499.0 million from December 31, 2023 to $4.92 billion as of December 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a $414.0 million decline in AFS securities. AFS securities totaled $2.54 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, inclusive of a pre-tax net unrealized loss of $447.7 million. The pre-tax unrealized loss declined by $2.1 million from December 31, 2023.

CVB is a holding company separate and apart from the Bank that must provide for its own liquidity and must service its own obligations. Substantially all of CVB’s revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the Bank to CVB. There are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to CVB. In addition, our regulators could limit the ability of the Bank or CVB to pay dividends or make other distributions.

Market Risk

In the normal course of its business activities, we are exposed to market risks, including price and liquidity risk. Market risk is the potential for loss from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates (interest rate risk). Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future commitments or that we may be more reliant on alternative funding sources such as long-term debt. Financial products that expose us to market risk include securities, loans, deposits, debt, and derivative financial instruments.

Interest Rate Sensitivity Management

During periods of changing interest rates, the ability to re-price interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities can influence net interest income, the net interest margin, and consequently, our earnings. Interest rate risk is managed by

75

attempting to control the spread between rates earned on interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities within the constraints imposed by market competition in our service area. The primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk, within policy limits approved by the Board of Directors. These limits and guidelines reflect our risk appetite for interest rate risk over both short-term and long-term horizons. We measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models, which, as described in additional detail below, are employed by management to understand net interest income (“NII”) at risk and economic value of equity (“EVE”) at risk. NII at risk sensitivity captures asset and liability repricing mismatches and is considered a shorter term measure, while EVE sensitivity captures mismatches within the period end balance sheets through the financial instruments’ respective maturities or estimated durations and is considered a longer term measure.

One of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis, which we use to model NII from the Company’s balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. We use simulation analysis to project rate sensitive income under many scenarios. The analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates, rate shocks, basis risk analysis, and yield curve scenarios. Specific balance sheet management strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on NII and EVE. Key assumptions in the simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and pricing spreads, the changes in product balances, and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments. This analysis incorporates several assumptions, the most material of which relate to the re-pricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non-contractual maturities, and prepayment of loans and securities.

Our interest rate risk policy measures the sensitivity of our net interest income over both a one-year and two-year cumulative time horizon.

The simulation model estimates the impact of changing interest rates on interest income from all interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on all interest-bearing liabilities reflected on our balance sheet. This sensitivity analysis is compared to policy limits, which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one and two year horizon assuming no balance sheet growth, given a 200 basis point upward and a 200 basis point downward shift in interest rates depending on the level of current market rates. The simulation model uses a parallel yield curve shift that ramps rates up or down on a pro rata basis over 12-months and measures the resulting net interest income sensitivity over both the 12-month and 24-month time horizons.

The following depicts the Company’s net interest income sensitivity analysis for the periods presented below, when rates are ramped up 200bps or ramped down 200bps over a 12-month time horizon.

Percentage change from base scenario.

Based on our current simulation models, we believe that the interest rate risk profile of the balance sheet is modestly asset sensitive over both a one-year and a two-year horizon. The estimated sensitivity does not necessarily represent a forecast and the results may not be indicative of actual changes to our net interest income. These estimates are based upon a number of assumptions including: the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape, re-pricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or non-contractual maturities, prepayments on loans and securities, pricing strategies on loans and deposits, and replacement of asset and liability cash flows. While the assumptions used are based on current economic and local market conditions, there is no assurance as to the predictive nature of these conditions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change.

We also perform valuation analysis, which incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all material balance sheet and derivative positions. The valuation of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of all asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of all liability cash flows, the net of which is referred to as EVE. The sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer-term re-pricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. EVE uses instantaneous changes in rates, as shown in the table below. The EVE Ratio represents economic value of equity as a percentage of the discounted present value of all asset cash flows and derivative cash flows. Assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash

76

flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected duration and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios. EVE sensitivity is reported in both upward and downward rate shocks. At December 31, 2024, the EVE profile indicates a decline in the EVE Ratio value due to instantaneous downward changes in rates and a modest increase in the EVE Ratio under upward rate shocks.  Compared to December 31, 2023, our EVE sensitivity to rising rates was modestly higher, as the EVE Ratio declined minimally at the end of 2023, while the decline in the EVE Ratio under declining rates was consistent across the two periods. Overall, our sensitivity of EVE to changes in interest rates is generally modest, with the exception of more meaningful decreases in the EVE Ratio if rates were to immediately decline by 300 or 400 basis points.

As EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in asset and liability mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates.

Counterparty Risk

Recent developments in the financial markets have placed an increased awareness of Counterparty Risks. These risks occur when a financial institution has an indebtedness or potential for indebtedness to another financial institution. We have assessed our Counterparty Risk with the following results:

•
We do not have any investments in the preferred stock of any other company; 

•
Most of our investment securities are either municipal securities or securities either issued or guaranteed by government, agencies, including FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, SBA or FHLB; 

•
All of our commercial line insurance policies are with companies with the highest AM Best ratings of A or above; 

•
We have no significant exposure to our Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance since the Cash Surrender Value balance is predominately supported by insurance companies that carry an AM Best rating of A or greater; 

•
We have no significant Counterparty exposure related to our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps. Our Counterparty is a major financial institution and our agreement requires the Counterparty to post cash collateral for mark-to-market balances due to us; 

•

•
We believe our risk of loss associated with our counterparty borrowers related to interest rate swaps not designated as hedging instruments is generally mitigated as the loans with swaps are underwritten to take into account potential additional exposure; 

•
To manage interest rate risk on our AFS securities portfolio, we have entered into pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap contracts to hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of such securities resulting from changes in interest rates. These interest rate swap contracts are designated as fair value hedges. Reforms mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act require certain types of derivatives (e.g., interest rate swaps, credit default swaps) to be processed through designated electronic trading platforms and cleared through registered clearing houses. Centrally-cleared derivatives are negotiated between the counterparties but contain standardized terms and are traded through a central clearing house. Because the derivative counterparties are required to post collateral to satisfy the mandatory margin requirements, the counterparties are not subject to counterparty credit risk; 

•
As of December 31, 2024, we had $305.0 million in Fed Funds lines of credit with other major U.S. banks. These lines of credit are available for overnight borrowings; and 

•
At December 31, 2024, we had $0.50 billion in borrowings with the FHLB. Our secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB totaled $5.73 billion, of which $5.23 billion was available as of December 31, 2024. 

Price and Foreign Exchange Risk

Price risk arises from changes in market factors that affect the value of traded instruments. Foreign exchange risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movements in foreign exchange rates.

Our current exposure to price risk is nominal. We do not have trading accounts. Consequently, the level of price risk within the investment portfolio is limited to the need to sell securities for reasons other than trading.

We maintain limited deposit accounts with various foreign banks. Our Interbank Liability Policy seeks to limit the balance in any of these accounts to an amount that does not in our judgment present a significant risk to our earnings from changes in the value of foreign currencies.

Our asset liability model seeks to calculate the market value of the Bank’s equity. In addition, management prepares, on a monthly basis, a capital volatility report that compares changes in the market value of the investment portfolio. We have as our target to always be well-capitalized by regulatory standards.

78

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT
IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices and interest rates. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities. We do not currently have futures, forwards, or option contracts.  As a result of the phase out of LIBOR, our interest rate swap derivatives and the associated loans that were indexed to LIBOR, have been replaced with one month CME Term SOFR.  All remaining financial instruments indexed to LIBOR have been transitioned to a replacement index, as of June 30, 2023.  For further quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks in our portfolio, see “Asset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Sensitivity Management” included in Item 7 — 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations
 presented elsewhere in this report. Our analysis of market risk and market-sensitive financial information contain forward looking statements and is subject to the disclosure at the beginning of Part I regarding such forward-looking information.

CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES

1)

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of CVB Financial Corp., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

As of December 31, 2024, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 is effective. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued their report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.

Auditor attestation

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
CVB Financial Corp.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited CVB Financial Corp. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We maintain controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such information is reported to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to allow timely and accurate disclosure based on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in SEC Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

CVB FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024

1.

BUSINESS

The consolidated financial statements include CVB Financial Corp. (referred to herein on an unconsolidated basis as “CVB” and on a consolidated basis as “we” “our” or the “Company”) and its wholly owned subsidiary: Citizens Business Bank (the “Bank” or “CBB”), after elimination of all intercompany transactions and balances. The Company has 
one
 inactive subsidiary, Chino Valley Bancorp.

The Company’s primary operations are related to traditional banking activities. This includes the acceptance of deposits and the lending and investing of money through the operations of the Bank. The Bank also provides trust and investment-related services to customers through its CitizensTrust Division. The Bank’s customers consist primarily of small to mid-sized businesses and individuals located throughout California. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank operat
ed 
62

banking centers, and 
three
 trust office locations. The Company is headquartered in the city of Ontario, California.

2.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for Form 10-K and conform to practices within the banking industry and include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for financial reporting.

Reclassification
 — Certain amounts in the prior periods’ financial statements and related footnote disclosures have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation with no impact on previously reported net income or stockholders’ equity.

3.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 
— The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. A material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relates to the determination of the allowance for credit losses. Other significant estimates, which may be subject to change, include fair value determinations and disclosures, impairment of investments, goodwill, loans, as well as valuation of deferred tax assets.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance within ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280)
. The amendments in this update are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures related to significant segment expenses. The amendments do not change how an entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments and all existing segment disclosure requirements in ASC 280 and other Codification topics remain unchanged. The amendments in this update are incremental and require public entities that report segment information to disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss as well as other segment items. Annual disclosure of the title and position of the chief operating decision maker and how the reported measures of segment profit or loss are used to assess performance and allocation of resources is also required. The Company adopted this ASU effective with this Form 10-K. See 
Business Segments
 below. As the amendments in this update relate entirely to disclosure requirements, adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
Business Segments
 — We regularly assess our strategic plans, operations, reporting structures and financial information provided to the Chief Executive Officer, our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), to identify our reportable segments. At December 31, 2024 and since September 30, 2018, we have operated as one reportable segment. Changes to our reportable segments are expected to be infrequent.

94

The factors considered in making this determination included the nature of products and services offered, geographic regions in which we operate, the applicable regulatory environment, and the materiality of discrete financial information reviewed by our CODM. Through our network of banking centers, we provide relationship-based banking products, services and solutions for small to mid-sized companies, real estate investors, non-profit organizations, professionals and other individuals. Our products include loans for commercial businesses, commercial real estate, multi-family, construction, land, dairy & livestock and agribusiness, consumer and government-guaranteed small business loans. We also provide business deposit products and treasury cash management services, as well as deposit products to the owners and employees of the businesses we serve. Our operations are throughout the state of California.
The Company has determined that all of its banking divisions meet the aggregation criteria of ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting
, as its current operating model is structured whereby banking divisions serve a similar base of primarily commercial clients utilizing a company-wide offering of similar products and services managed through similar processes and platforms, and therefore operates one line of business that is collectively reviewed by the CODM. The CODM regularly assesses performance of the aggregated single reporting segment and decides how to allocate resources based on net income calculated on the same basis as net income reported in the Company's consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income. The CODM is also regularly provided with expense information at a level consistent with that disclosed in the Company's consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income.

Cash and cash equivalents 
— Cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, and amounts due from correspondent banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and interest-bearing balances due from depository institutions with initial terms of ninety days or less, are included in Cash and cash equivalents.

Investment Securities
 — The Company classifies as HTM those debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Securities classified as trading are those securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. All other debt and equity securities are classified as AFS. Securities held-to-maturity are accounted for at cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Trading securities are accounted for at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses being included in current earnings. Available-for-sale securities are accounted for at fair value, with the net unrealized gains and losses, net of income tax effects, presented as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are recognized in earnings at the time of sale and are determined on a specific-identification basis. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the effective-yield method over the estimated terms of the securities. For mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), the amortization or accretion is based on estimated average lives of the securities. The lives of these securities can fluctuate based on the amount of prepayments received on the underlying collateral of the securities. The Company’s investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (“FHLB”) stock is carried at cost and periodically assessed for impairment. Both cash and stock dividends received on FHLB stock are reported as income.
In accordance with ASU No. 2016-13, “
Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”
, AFS debt securities are measured at fair value and are subject to impairment testing. A security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost basis. When an available-for-sale debt security is considered impaired, the Company must determine if the decline in fair value has resulted from a credit-related loss or other factors and then, (1) recognize allowance for credit losses by a charge to earnings for the credit-related component (if any) of the decline in fair value, and (2) recognize in other comprehensive income (loss) non-credit related components of the fair value decline (if any). If the amount of the amortized cost basis expected to be recovered increases in a future period, the valuation allowance would be reduced, but not more than the amount of the current existing allowance for that security.

Loans and Lease Finance Receivables
 — Loans and lease finance receivables that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of nonaccrual interest paid, deferred loan origination fees and costs, and purchase price discounts and premiums (amortized cost basis). Refer to Note 5 —
 Loans and Lease Finance Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses
.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into commitments to extend credit to its customers. To the extent that such commitments are unfunded, the related unfunded amounts are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The Company receives collateral to support loans, lease finance receivables, and commitments to extend credit for which collateral is deemed necessary. The most significant categories for which collateral is deemed necessary are real estate, principally commercial and industrial income-producing properties, Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans, real estate mortgages, assets utilized in dairy & livestock and agribusiness, and various personal property assets utilized in commercial and industrial business governed by the Uniform Commercial Code.

95

Nonrefundable fees and direct costs associated with the origination or purchase of loans are deferred and netted against outstanding loan balances. The deferred net loan fees and costs and purchase price discounts are recognized in interest income over the loan term using the effective-yield method.

Nonaccrual, Past Due, Charge-Offs

and Recoveries
 — Interest on loans and lease finance receivables, is credited to income based on the principal amounts of such loans or receivables outstanding. Loans are considered delinquent when principal or interest payments are past due 
30
 days or more and generally remain on accrual status between 
30
 and 
89
 days past due. Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans. In general, interest shall not accrue on any loan for which payment in full of principal and interest is not expected, or when the loan becomes 
90
 days past due, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Factors considered in determining that the full collection of principal and interest is no longer probable include cash flow and liquidity of the borrower or property, the financial position of the guarantors and their willingness to support the loan as well as other factors, and this determination involves significant judgment. When an asset is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against income. Subsequent collections of cash are applied as reductions to the principal balance unless the loan is returned to accrual status. Interest is not recognized using a cash-basis method. Nonaccrual loans may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest become current and when the borrower is able to demonstrate payment performance for a sustained period, typically for 
six months
. A nonaccrual loan may return to accrual status sooner based on other significant events or mitigating circumstances. Interest income is not recognized on loans and lease finance receivables when collection of interest is deemed by management to be doubtful. Charge-offs are recognized in the period an obligation becomes uncollectible. When determining the amount of the charge-off, management considers all components of the loan’s amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest receivable (as disclosed herein); however, the non-principal portion of charge-offs have been determined to be immaterial. This policy is consistently applied to all types of loans and lease finance receivables.

Charge-offs of unsecured consumer loans are recorded when the loan reaches 
120
 days past due or sooner as circumstances indicate.

Purchased Loans 
— All purchased loans are initially measured and recorded at their fair value on the acquisition date. A component of the initial fair value measurement is an estimate of the credit losses over the life of the purchased loans. Purchased loans are also evaluated to determine if there is a more than insignificant deterioration of credit since origination. ASU 2016-13, requires purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) assets to be recorded at their purchase price plus an allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) estimated at the time of acquisition as described below.

Purchased Loans with Credit Deterioration

ASU 2016-13 requires an allowance for purchased financial assets with more than an insignificant deterioration of credit since origination. The acquisition-date ACL for PCD loans will be allocated to the individual PCD loans (assuming it was originally determined on a collective basis). The sum of the purchase price of the loan (the acquisition date fair value for a loan acquired in a business combination) and the ACL becomes the loan’s new amortized cost basis. The difference between the new amortized cost basis and the unpaid principal balance of the loan represents the non-credit purchase premium or discount that will be amortized or accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan.

Subsequent to an acquisition, the ACL for PCD loans will generally follow the same estimation, provision and charge-off process as non-PCD acquired and originated loans. Additionally, the identification of modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for acquired loans (PCD and non-PCD) will be consistent with the identification for originated loans.

Modifications of Loans to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2022-02, 
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures
 (“ASU 2022-02”) effective January 1, 2023. The amendments in ASU 2022-02 eliminated the recognition and measurement of troubled debt restructurings and enhanced disclosures for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.
In situations where the Company has determined that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and is evaluating whether a concession is insignificant, and therefore does not result in a reportable modification, such analysis is based on an evaluation of both the amount and the timing of the restructured payments, including the following factors:

1.
Whether the amount of the restructured payments subject to delay is insignificant relative to the unpaid principal balance or collateral value of the debt and will result in an insignificant shortfall in the contractual amount due; and 

96

2.
The delay is insignificant relative to any of the following: 
•
The frequency of payments due; 
•
The debt’s original contractual maturity; or 
•
The debt’s original expected duration. 
All accruing restructured loans are reported as modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, if (i) the concession(s) are considered significant and (ii) it is determined the borrower is facing financial difficulties. A loan that has been placed on nonaccrual status that is subsequently restructured will remain on nonaccrual status until the borrower is able to demonstrate repayment performance in compliance with the restructured terms for a sustained period of time, generally for a minimum of six months. A restructured loan may return to accrual status sooner based on other significant events or circumstances.

Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses 
— In accordance with ASU No. 2016-13, “
Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
”, our allowance for credit losses is based upon lifetime loss rate models developed from an estimation framework that uses historical lifetime loss experiences to derive loss rates at a collective pool level. This "expected loss" model, referred to as the CECL model, applies to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, HTM securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees. AFS debt securities are measured at fair value and are subject to impairment testing. This ASU for AFS debt securities requires an allowance for credit impairment instead of a direct write-down, which allows for reversal of credit impairments in future periods based on improvements in credit. When an AFS debt security is considered impaired, and the Company determines that the decline in fair value has resulted from a credit-related loss (as described previously under 
Investment Securities)
, then an allowance for credit losses will be recognized by a charge to earnings for the credit-related component of the decline in fair value. As a result, we will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings. As a policy election, we exclude the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis of financing receivables and HTM securities, as well as AFS securities, and disclose total accrued interest receivable separately on the consolidated balance sheet. If accrued interest is not received, it is reversed against interest income.

We monitor credit quality by evaluating various risk attributes and utilize such information in our evaluation of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses. An important element of our approach to credit risk management is our loan risk rating system (Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful and Loss). Loan risk ratings are updated as facts related to the loan or borrower become available. In addition,
 all term loans in excess of $
1.0
 million are subject to an annual internal credit review process where all factors underlying the loan, borrower and guarantors are subject to review which may result in changes to the loan’s risk rating.

Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance is conducted on a regular basis and considers the Bank’s overall loan portfolio. Refer to Note 5 —
 Loans and Lease Finance Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses, Credit Quality Indicators.

Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments 
— The reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposure relates to commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and undisbursed funds on lines of credit. The Company evaluates credit risk associated with the off-balance sheet loan commitments in the same manner as it evaluates credit risk associated with the loan and lease portfolio. The reserve is calculated on the expected portion of the commitment to be funded over its life and the life of the commitment loss expectation, utilizing the same three collective pool methodologies described for the Allowance for Credit Losses. We include the reserve for unfunded loan commitments in other liabilities and the related provision in other noninterest expense.

Other Real Estate Owned 
— Other real estate owned (“OREO”) represents real estate acquired through foreclosure in lieu of repayment of commercial and real estate loans and is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell (establishing a new cost basis). Loan balances in excess of fair value of the real estate acquired at the date of acquisition are charged against the allowance for credit losses. Any subsequent operating expenses or income, reduction in estimated values, and gains or losses on disposition of such properties are charged to current operations. Gain recognition upon disposition of a property is dependent on the sale having met certain criteria relating to the buyer’s initial investment in the property sold.

Premises and Equipment
 — 
Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, which is provided for in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over the estimated service lives of the

97

respective 
asset and are computed on a straight-line basis. 
The ranges of useful lives of the principal classes of assets are as follows: 

Bank premises

15
 - 
39
 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of estimated economic lives of 15 years or term of the lease.

Computer equipment

3
 - 
7
 years

Furniture, fixtures and equipment

5
 - 
10
 years

Long-lived assets are reviewed periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The existence of impairment is based on undiscounted cash flows. To the extent impairment exists, the impairment is calculated as the difference in fair value of assets and their carrying value. The impairment loss, if any, would be recorded in noninterest expense. Net gains or net losses on dispositions of premises and equipment are recorded in noninterest income.
Long-lived assets classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Assets-held-for sale include long-lived assets transferred from our “held-and-used” portfolio in the period in which the following criteria are met:

•
Management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the asset; 
•
The asset is available for immediate sale, an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated; 
•
The sale of the asset is probable, and transfer of the asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale, within one year; 
•
The asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and 
•
Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 — Goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009, represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of the businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently, if events and circumstances exist that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed.

Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheets. Based on the Company’s annual impairment test, there was 
no
 recorded impairment as of December 31, 2024.

Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from business combinations and are amortized using an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives
.

Use of Fair Value
 — We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. Investment securities available-for-sale and interest-rate swaps are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record at fair value other assets on a non-recurring basis, such as individually evaluated loans and OREO. These non-recurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Further, we include in Note 17 —
 Fair Value Information 
of the consolidated financial statements information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the valuation methodologies used and its impact to earnings. Additionally, for financial instruments not recorded at fair value we disclose the estimate of their fair value. Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully described in a separate note.
Bank Owned Life Insurance 
— The Company invests in Bank Owned Life Insurance (“BOLI”). BOLI involves the purchasing of life insurance by the Company on a select group of employees. The Company is the owner and primary beneficiary of these policies. BOLI is recorded as an asset at the cash surrender value. Increases in the cash value of these policies, as well as insurance proceeds received, are recorded in other noninterest income and are not subject to income tax for as long as they are held for the life of the covered employee.

98

Qualified Affordable Housing Partnerships and Tax Credit Partnerships 
— The Bank invests in qualified affordable housing partnerships and accounts for these investments using the proportional amortization method. Under the proportional amortization method, the Bank amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received, and recognizes the amortization as a component of income tax expense. The Bank also invests in various tax credit partnerships pursuant to Sections 42 and 48 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Bank acts as a limited partner in these investments and does not exercise control over the financial or operating policies of the partnerships and as such, is not considered the primary beneficiary of the partnership. Upon entering into new solar tax equity investments in the second quarter of 2023, the Company elected to account for tax credit partnerships using the proportional amortization method on a prospective basis.

Income Taxes
 — Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. Based on historical and future expected taxable earnings, the Company considers the future realization of these deferred tax assets more likely than not. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
The tax effects from an uncertain tax position are recognized in the financial statements only if, based on its merits, the position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit by the taxing authorities. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Refer to Note 9

— 
Income Taxes
 for additional information.
Operating Leases — 
At December 31, 2024, the Company only had operating leases for our leased facilities, which are used primarily for the banking operations of the Company. All leases in the current portfolio have been classified as operating leases, although this may change in the future. Operating leases with a term of more than one year are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company made a policy election to apply the short-term lease exemption to any operating leases with an original term of less than 12 months, therefore no ROU asset or lease liability is recorded for these operating leases. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception by assessing whether there is an identified asset and whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are included in 
other assets
 and 
other liabilities
, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, factoring in the lease term, to determine the lease liability, which is measured at the present value of future lease payments. The ROU assets, at adoption of this ASU, were initially recorded at the amount of the lease liability plus any prepaid rent and initial direct costs, less any lease incentives and accrued rent. The lease terms include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease depending on whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise such options. Refer to Note 21 —
 Leases
 for more information.

Earnings per Common Share
 — The Company calculates earnings per common share (“EPS”) using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, earnings available to common stockholders for the period are allocated between common stockholders and participating securities according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. All outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends are considered participating securities. The Company has granted restricted shares under the 2008 and 2018 Equity Incentive Plans that qualify as participating securities. Restricted shares issued under these plans are entitled to dividends at the same rate as common stockholders. A reconciliation of the numerator and the denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is included in Note 14 — 
Earnings Per Share Reconciliation
 of these consolidated financial statements.

Stock-Based Compensation
 — The Company issues stock-based compensation instruments consisting of incentive stock options (“ISOs”), time-based restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”). Compensation expense related to ISOs and RSAs is based on the fair value of the underlying stock on the award date and is recognized over the required service period using the straight-line method. Forfeitures of stock-based awards are recognized when they occur.

99

The fair value of each ISO grant is estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Management assumptions used at the time of grant impact the fair value of the option calculated under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and ultimately, the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option.

The grant date fair value of RSA and PRSU awards is the market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant. Compensation expense related to PRSUs is amortized over the vesting period using the straight-line method unless it is determined that: (1) attainment of the financial metrics is less than probable, in which case a portion of the amortization is suspended, or (2) attainment of the financial metrics is improbable, in which case a portion of the previously recognized amortization is reversed and also suspended. PRSU expense may vary during the performance period based upon changes in management's estimate of the number of shares that may ultimately vest.

Unexercised ISOs do not participate with common stock in any dividends declared and paid. Unvested RSAs participate with common stock in any dividends declared and paid. Unvested PRSUs participate with common stock in any dividends declared, but are only paid on the shares which ultimately vest, if any, at the end of the performance period. At the time of vesting, the vested shares are entitled to receive cumulative dividends declared and paid during the performance period.
Additional information is included in Note 15 — 
Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
of the consolidated financial statements included herein.

Derivative Financial Instruments
 — All derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a fair value hedge (i.e., a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability), a cash flow hedge (i.e., a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability), or a free-standing derivative instrument. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. All changes in fair value for cash flow hedges, are recorded in “Other Comprehensive Income,” net of deferred taxes, including any ineffectiveness as long as the hedge remains highly effective.

We assess hedge effectiveness under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, on a quarterly basis to ensure all hedges remain highly effective and hedge accounting under ASC 815 can be applied. In conjunction with the assessment of effectiveness, we assess the hedged item to ensure it is expected to be outstanding at the hedged item’s assumed maturity date and the portfolio layer method of accounting under ASC 815 can be applied. The portfolio layer method allows multiple hedged layers of a single closed portfolio. Fair value basis adjustments in an existing portfolio layer method hedge are maintained at the closed portfolio level (Balance Sheet line item level) and are therefore not allocated to individual assets.

Statement of Cash Flows
 — Cash and cash equivalents, as reported in the statements of cash flows, include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing balances due from depository institutions and federal funds sold with original maturities of three months or less. Cash flows from loans and deposits are reported net.

Other Contingencies 
— In the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in litigation. Based upon the Company’s internal records and discussions with legal counsel, the Company records accruals as appropriate, for estimates of the probable outcome of all cases brought against the Company. Except as discussed in Note 12 — 
Commitments and Contingencies
 at December 31, 2024, the Company does not have any material litigation accruals and is not aware of any material pending legal action or complaints asserted against the Company.

The following summarizes our analysis of these securities and the unrealized losses.

Government Agency & Government-Sponsored Enterprise — The government agency bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of agencies of the U.S. Government. While the Government-Sponsored Enterprise bonds are not expressly guaranteed by the U.S. Government, they are currently being supported by the U.S. Government under a conservatorship arrangement. These securities are bullet securities, that is, they have a defined maturity date on which the principal is paid. The contractual term of these investments provides that the Company will receive the face value of the bond at maturity which will equal the amortized cost of the bond. Interest is received throughout the life of the security. Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the bonds.

Mortgage-Backed Securities (“MBS”) and CMO/REMIC — Most of the Company’s mortgage-backed and CMO/REMIC securities are issued by Government Agencies or Government-Sponsored Enterprises such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These securities are collateralized or backed by the underlying residential or commercial mortgages. All mortgage-backed securities are considered to be rated investment grade with a weighted average life of approximately 
7.5
 years. Of the total MBS/CMO, 
100
% have the implied guarantee of U.S. Government-Sponsored Agencies and Enterprises. Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the bonds. There were 
no
 credit-related impairments for the year ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Municipal Bonds — The majority of the Company’s municipal bonds, with maturities of approximately 
12.0
 years, represented approximately 
9.7
% of the total investment portfolio and are predominately AA or higher rated securities. The Company diversifies its holdings by owning selections of securities from different issuers and by holding securities from geographically diversified municipal issuers, thus reducing the Company’s exposure to any single adverse event. The decline in fair value is primarily due to the changes in interest rates. There were no credit-related impairments for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

At December 31, 2024, investment securities with carrying values of
 $
2.79
 billio
n were pledged to secure various types of deposits, including
 $
1.18
 bill
ion of public funds, $
315
 million for repurchase agreements, and for other purposes as required or permitted by law. In addition, investment securities with carrying values o
f $
1.63
 bil
lion were pledged for unused borrowing capacity.
At December 31, 2023
, investment securities with carrying values of $
2.26
 billion were pledged to secure various types of deposits, including $
1.38
 billion of public funds. In addition, investment securities, with carrying values of $
3.02
 billion were pledged to secure $
372.5
 million for repurchase agreements, $
1.8
 billion for outstanding borrowings, $
796
 million for unused borrowing capacity and approximately $
51
 million for other purposes as required or permitted by law.

103

The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities at December 31, 2024, by contractual maturity, are shown in the table below. Although mortgage-backed and CMO/REMIC securities have weighted average remaining contractual maturities of approximate
ly 
25
 years, expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay such obligations wit
hout penalty. 
Mortgage-backed and CMO/REMIC securities are included in maturity categories based upon estimated average lives which incorporate estimated prepayment speeds.

Credit Quality Indicators
We monitor credit quality by evaluating various risk attributes and utilize such information in our evaluation of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses. Internal credit risk ratings, within our loan risk rating system, are the credit quality indicators that we most closely monitor.

An important element of our approach to credit risk management is our loan risk rating system. The originating officer assigns each loan an initial risk rating, which is reviewed and confirmed or changed, as appropriate, by credit management. Approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit management personnel. Credits are monitored by line and credit management personnel for deterioration or improvement in a borrower’s financial condition, which would impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract. Risk ratings are adjusted as necessary.
Loans are risk rated into the following categories: Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful and Loss. Each of these groups is assessed for the proper amount to be used in determining the adequacy of our allowance for losses. These categories can be described as follows:

Pass — These loans, including loans on the Bank’s internal watch list, range from minimal credit risk to lower than average, but still acceptable, credit risk. Watch list loans usually require more than normal management attention. Loans on the watch list may involve borrowers with adverse financial trends, higher debt/equity ratios, or weaker liquidity positions, but not to the degree of being considered a defined weakness or problem loan where risk of loss may be apparent.

Special Mention — Loans assigned to this category have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or the Company’s credit position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.

Substandard — Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Assets so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Substandard loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected.

Doubtful — Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or the liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.

Loss — Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset with insignificant value even though partial recovery may be affected in the future.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The 
Company's allowance models calculate reserves over the average life of the loan, which includes the remaining time to maturity, adjusted for estimated prepayments applied as an adjustment to our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. Our allowance for credit losses is based upon lifetime loss rate models developed from an estimation framework that uses historical lifetime loss experiences to derive loss rates at a collective pool level. We measure the expected credit losses on a collective (pooled) basis for those loans that share similar risk characteristics. We have three collective loan pools: Commercial Real Estate, Commercial and Industrial, and Consumer. A substantial portion of the ACL relates to loans within the Commercial Real Estate and Commercial and Industrial methodologies, each evaluated on a

109

collective 
basis. Our ACL amounts are largely driven by portfolio characteristics, including loss history, internal risk grading, various risk attributes, and the economic outlook for certain macroeconomic variables. Risk attributes for commercial real estate loans include original loan to value ratios, origination year, loan seasoning, and macroeconomic variables that include GDP growth, commercial real estate price index and unemployment rate. Risk attributes for commercial and industrial loans include internal risk ratings, borrower industry sector, loan credit spreads and macroeconomic variables that include unemployment rate and BBB spread. The macroeconomic variables for Consumer include unemployment rate and GDP. The Commercial Real Estate methodology is applied over commercial real estate loans, a portion of construction loans, and a portion of SBA loans. The Commercial and Industrial methodology is applied over a substantial portion of the Company’s commercial and industrial loans, all dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans, municipal lease receivables, as well as the remaining portion of SBA loans (excluding PPP loans). The Consumer methodology is applied to SFR mortgage loans, consumer loans, as well as the remaining construction loans. In addition to determining the quantitative life of loan loss rate to be applied against the amortized cost basis of the portfolio segments, management reviews current conditions and forecasts to determine whether adjustments are needed to ensure that the life of loan loss rates reflect both the current state of the portfolio, and expectations for macroeconomic changes. The Company’s ACL estimate incorporates a reasonable and supportable forecast of various macroeconomic variables over the remaining average life of our loans. This forecast incorporates an assumption that each macroeconomic variable will revert to a long-term expectation, starting in years two through three, of the reasonable and supportable forecast period, with the reversion largely completed within the first five years of the forecast. The economic forecast is based on probability weighted scenarios to address macroeconomic uncertainty. Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed on a regular basis and considers overall risks in the Bank’s loan portfolio. Refer to Note 3 – 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 contained herein for a more detailed discussion concerning the allowance for credit losses.

The ACL totaled $
80.1
 million as of 
December 31, 2024
, compared to $
86.8
 million as of 
December 31, 2023
. The $
6.7
 million decrease is comprised of a $
3.0
 million recapture of provision for credit losses and $
3.7
 million in net charge-offs. At 
December 31, 2024
, the ACL as a percentage of total loans and leases, at amortized cost was 
0.94
% of total loans. This  compares to 
0.98
% at 
December 31, 2023
.  The ACL increased by $
1.7
 million for 2023 and included a provision for credit losses of $
2.0
 million, offset by net charge-offs of $
0.3
 million. As a result of the acquisition of Suncrest, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $
4.9
 million on January 7, 2022 to establish the ACL for the acquired loans that were not considered PCD. The ACL at January 7, 2022, also included $
8.6
 million for the acquired Suncrest PCD loans. The $
20.1
 million increase in the ACL from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was comprised of approximately $
893,000
 in net recoveries, the $
8.6
 million for the Suncrest PCD loans and a $
10.6
 million provision for credit losses, including the $
4.9
 million provision recorded to establish the ACL for the non-PCD loans acquired from Suncrest. Our economic forecast continues to be a blend of multiple forecasts produced by Moody’s. 
These U.S. economic forecasts include a baseline forecast, as well as upside and downside forecasts. 
The baseline forecast continues to represent the largest weighting in our multi-weighted forecast scenario, with both upside and downside risks weighted among multiple forecasts. The resulting economic forecast reflects GDP growing at slower rate than 2024, with GDP growth forecasted below 
2
% for 2025 through 2027.  Commercial Real Estate values are forecasted to continue their decline in 2025, with appreciation starting in 2027. Unemployment is forecasted to rise above 
5
% in 2025 and remains over 
5
% until 2028.
Management believes that the ACL was appropriate at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Due to inflationary pressures, high interest rates, lower commercial real estate values, and geopolitical events, no assurance can be given that economic conditions that adversely affect the Company’s service areas or other circumstances will not be reflected in increased provisions for credit losses in the future.

The following tables present the balance and activity related to the allowance for credit losses for held-for-investment loans by type for the periods presented.

Past Due and Nonperforming Loans

We seek to manage asset quality and control credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio and the application of policies designed to promote sound underwriting and loan monitoring practices. The Bank’s Credit Management Division is responsible for monitoring asset quality, establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the Bank. Reviews of nonperforming, past due loans and larger credits, designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for credit losses, are conducted on an ongoing basis. These reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers and any guarantors, the value of the applicable collateral, loan loss experience, estimated credit losses, growth in the loan portfolio, prevailing economic conditions and other factors. Refer to Note 3 – 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
, included herein, for additional discussion concerning the Bank’s policy for past due and nonperforming loans.

Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments

The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure relates to commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and undisbursed funds on lines of credit. The Company evaluates credit risk associated with the off-balance sheet loan commitments in the same manner as it evaluates credit risk associated with the loan and lease portfolio. The Bank's ACL methodology produced an allowance
 of $
6.3
 mill
ion for the off-balance sheet credit exposures as of December 31, 2024. There was 
$
1.25
 million in
 recapture of provision for unfunded loan commitments for the year ended December 31, 2024
 and $
0.5
 million in recapture of provision for the year ended 
December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the balance in this reserve was 
$
6.3

million and $
7.5
 million, respectively, and was included in other liabilities.

Modifications of Loans to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty

The Company invests in low income housing tax credit and solar tax funds that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits. The Company accounts for these investments by amortizing the cost of tax credit investments over the life of the investment using a proportional amortization method and tax credit investment amortization expense is a component of the provision for income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2024
, tax credits and other benefits recognized was $
21.3
 million and the tax credit amortization expense included in the provision for income taxes was $
17.4
 million.

The following table presents the balances of the Company's tax credit investments and related unfunded commitments at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

BORROWINGS

Customer Repurchase Agreements

The Bank offers a repurchase agreement product to its customers. This product, known as Citizens Sweep Manager, sells our investment securities overnight to our customers under an agreement to repurchase them the next day at a price which reflects the market value of the use of funds by the Bank for the period concerned. These repurchase agreements are signed with customers who want to invest their excess deposits, above a pre-determined balance in a demand deposit account, in order to earn interest. As of December 31, 2024, total funds borrowed under these agreements wer
e $
261.9
 million with a weighted average interest rate of 
0.72
%
, compared to $
271.6
 million with a weighted average interest rate of 
0.29
% at 
December 31, 2023.

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Other Borrowings

As of December 31, 2024, total borrowings were $
500
 million and consisted of advances from the FHLB, at an average rate of 
4.6
%. The FHLB advances include $
300
 million, at a fixed rate of 
4.73
%, maturing in May 2026, and $
200
 million, at a fixed rate of 
4.27
%, maturing in May of 2027. 
As of December 31, 2023, total short-term borrowin
gs were $
2.07
 billion, and consisted of $
1.91
 billion of one
-year advances from the Federal Reserve’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”)
 at a cost of 
4.78
%, which replaced higher cost borrowings from the FHLB, and $
160
 million of short-term FHLB advances, at an average cost of approximately 
5.7
%.

At December 31, 2024, 
$
4.44
 billion of loans and $
4.79
 billion of investment securities, at carrying value, were pledged to secure public deposits, repurchase agreements, borrowing lines, and for other purposes as required or permitted by law.

12.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Commitments

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
the Bank had commitments to extend credit of approximately $
1.72
 billion and $
1.71
 billion, respectively, and obligations under letters of credit of $
60.0
 million and $
54.3
 million, respectively. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers, provided there is no violation of any material condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Commitments are generally variable rate, and many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon. As such, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We use the same credit underwriting policies in granting or accepting such commitments or contingent obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments, which consist of evaluating customers’ creditworthiness individually. The Bank had a reserve for unfunded loan commitments of $
6.3
 million and $
7.5
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in other liabilities.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the financial performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support private borrowing or purchase arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. When deemed necessary, we hold appropriate collateral supporting those commitments.  Management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these transactions.
We invest in LIHTC, tax credit and other CRA-related investments that call for capital contributions up to an amount specified in the partnership agreements. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had commitments to contribute capital to these entities totaling $
45.8
 million and $
8.7
 million.

At December 31, 2024
, the Bank had $
0.50
 billion in borrowings with the FHLB. The Bank's secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRB totaled $
5.73
 billion, of which $
5.23
 billion was available as of December 31, 2024.  The Bank also has $
305.0
 million in Fed Funds lines of credit with other major U.S. banks. These lines of credit are available for overnight borrowings.
At December 31, 2024
, investment securities with carrying values of 
2.79
 billion were pledged to secure various types of deposits, including $
1.18
 billion of public funds, $
315
 million for repurchase agreements and $
57
 million for other purposes as required or permitted by law. In addition, investment securities with carrying values of $
1.63
 billion were pledged for unused borrowing capacity.

122

Other Contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various lawsuits and threatened lawsuits in the course of business. From time to time, such lawsuits and threatened lawsuits may include, but are not limited to, actions involving securities litigation, employment matters, wage-hour and labor law claims, consumer claims, regulatory compliance claims, data privacy claims, lender liability claims, bankruptcy-related claims and negligence claims, some of which may be styled as “class action” or representative cases. Some of these lawsuits may be similar in nature to other lawsuits pending against the Company’s competitors.

For lawsuits where the Company has determined that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, a liability representing the best estimate of the Company’s financial exposure based on known facts has been recorded in accordance with FASB guidance over loss contingencies (ASC 450). However, as a result of inherent uncertainties in judicial interpretation and application of a myriad of laws and regulations applicable to the Company’s business, and the unique, complex factual issues presented in any given lawsuit, the Company often cannot determine the probability of loss or estimate the amount of damages which a plaintiff might successfully prove if the Company were found to be liable. For lawsuits or threatened lawsuits where a claim has been asserted or the Company has determined that it is probable that a claim will be asserted, and there is a reasonable possibility that the outcome will be unfavorable, the Company will disclose the existence of the loss contingency, even if the Company is not able to make an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss with respect to the action or potential action in question, unless the Company believes that the nature, potential magnitude or potential timing (if known) of the loss contingency is not reasonably likely to be material to the Company’s liquidity, consolidated financial position, and/or results of operations.

Our accruals and disclosures for loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as additional information becomes available. We disclose a loss contingency and/or the amount accrued if we believe it is reasonably likely to be material or if we believe such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. If we determine that an exposure to loss exists in excess of an amount previously accrued or disclosed, we assess whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss, or additional loss, may have been incurred, and we adjust our accruals and disclosures accordingly.

We do not presently believe that the ultimate resolution of any lawsuits currently pending against the Company will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. The outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain, however, and it is possible that one or more of the legal matters currently pending or threatened against the Company could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Deferred Compensation Plans

As of December 31, 2024
 the Company had various deferred compensation plans, which included a deferred compensation plan for its former President and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher D. Myers, and severance arrangements it assumed through the acquisition of other banks in prior years. We also offer a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for our executives and key members of management in order to assist us in attracting and retaining these individuals. Participants in the plan may elect to defer a portion of their annual salary and/or short-term incentive payouts into deferral accounts to provide a means by which they may elect to defer receipt of compensation in order to provide retirement benefits. The plan is intended to be unfunded and allows us to make discretionary contributions on behalf of a participant. 
No
 discretionary payments were made by the Company during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The Bank, however, does fund the cost of these plans through the purchase of bank owned life insurance policies, which are reflected as assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total deferred compensation liability was
 $
22.9
 million and $
22.3
 million, respectively. Total expense for these deferred compensation agreements was approximately $
1.9
 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, and was $
1.2
 million and $
534,000
 for the years ended December 31, 
2023 and 2022, respectively.

123

401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan

The Bank sponsors a 401(k) and profit-sharing plan for the benefit of its employees. Employees are eligible to participate in the plan immediately upon hire. Employees may make contributions to the plan under the plan’s 401(k) component. The Bank contributes 
3
%, non-matching, to the plan to comply with ERISA’s safe harbor provisions. The Bank may make additional contributions under the plan’s profit-sharing component, subject to certain limitations. The contribution made in
 2024
 was 
1
%, compared to

2
%
 for 2023
 and 
3
% for 
2022. The Bank’s total contributions are determined by the Board of Directors and amounted to approximatel
y $
4.0
 million for 
2024
, $
4.8
 million for 
2023
, and $
5.2
 million for
 2022

EARNINGS PER SHARE RECONCILIATION

Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing income allocated to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. The computation of diluted earnings per common share considers the number of shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of outstanding common stock options. Antidilutive common shares are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, shares deemed to be antidilutive, and thus excluded from the computation of earnings per common share wer
e 
963,000
, 
1,044,000
 and 
236,000
, respectively.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

In May 2018, the shareholders approved the 2018 Equity Plan which authorizes the issuance of up to 
9,000,000
 shares of CVB’s common stock for eligible participants, which include all of the Company’s employees, officers, and directors, and expires in 2028. The plan authorizes the issuance of a variety of types of equity awards, which include incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and other stock-based awards, including performance-based restricted stock units ("PRSUs"). The 
2018
 Equity Plan replaced the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan. No further grants will be made under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, but shares may continue to be issued under such plan pursuant to grants previously made. As of 
December 31, 2024, we hav
e 
1,655,383
 outstanding options, unvested RSAs, RSUs and PRSUs under our Equity Plans.

Stock Options

The Company expensed

, $
384,000
, and $
273,000
, for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The estimated fair value of the options granted during 2024
 and prior years was calculated using the Black-Scholes options pricing model. There were 
95,000
, 
107,000
 and 
66,000
 options granted during 
2024, 2023 and 2022

The 
options will vest, in equal installments, over a 
five-year
 period. 
The fair value of each stock option granted in 
2024, 2023 and 2022, was estimated on the date of grant using the following weighted-average assumptions.

The expected volatility is solely based on the daily historical stock price volatility over the expected option life. The expected life of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time an optionee will hold an option before exercising it. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury five-year constant maturity yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur, rather than to estimate forfeitures over the vesting period.

REGULATORY MATTERS

The Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking regulatory agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct, material effect on the Company’s and the Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgment by the regulators about components, risk-weightings, and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies.

The Bank and the Company are required to meet risk-based capital standards under the revised capital framework referred to as Basel III set by their respective regulatory authorities. The risk-based capital standards require the achievement of a minimum common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio of 
4.5
%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 
6.0
% and total risk-based capital ratio of 
8.0
%. In addition, the regulatory authorities require the highest rated institutions to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 
4.0
%. To be considered “well-capitalized” for bank regulatory purposes, the Bank and the Company are required to have a Tier 1 leverage ratio equal to or greater than 
5.0
%, a CET1 capital ratio equal to or greater than 
6.5
%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 
8.0
%, a total risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 
10.0
%. In addition to meeting the minimum capital requirements, under the Basel III Capital Rules, the Company and the Bank must also maintain the required Capital Conservation Buffer to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management. The Capital Conservation Buffer is calculated as a ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and it effectively increases the required minimum risk-based capital ratios. The Capital Conservation Buffer is now at its fully phased-in level of 
2.5
% and including the capital conservation buffer results in a minimum required CET1 capital ratio of 
7.0
%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 
8.5
% and 
10.5
% for the total risk-based capital ratio.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total capital, Tier 1 capital and CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Management believes that, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the most recent notifications from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, CET1 risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage (tangible Tier 1 capital divided by average total assets) ratios as set forth in the table below must be maintained. There are no conditions or events since said notification that management believes have changed the Bank’s category.

FAIR VALUE INFORMATION

Fair Value Hierarchy

Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.

The following disclosure provides the fair value information for financial assets and liabilities as of  December 31, 2024. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels (Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3).

•
Level 1 — 
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. 
•
Level 2
 — Observable inputs other than Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in less active markets, or other observable inputs or model-derived valuations that can be corroborated by observable market data, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
•
Level 3
 — Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. These valuation methodologies generally include pricing models, discounted cash flow models, or a determination of fair value that requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The tables below present the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the dates presented.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

We may be required to remeasure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets.

For assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis that were held on the balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and 2023,
 respectively, 
the following tables provide the level of valuation assumptions used to determine each adjustment and the carrying value of the related assets that had losses during the period. The fair values were determined using inputs based on observable market data or based on discounted cash flow criteria.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure our Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (under ASC Topic 820, “
Fair Value Measurement
”) and for estimating fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value (under ASC Topic 825).

Interest-earning balances due from depository institutions. 
The carrying amount is assumed to be the fair value given the short-term nature of these deposits.
Investment securities available-for-sale. 
Securities available-for-sale are measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis. In determining the fair value of securities available-for-sale, we obtain a report from a nationally recognized broker-dealer detailing the fair value of each investment security we hold as of the reporting date. The broker-dealer used observable market information to value our securities, with the primary source being a nationally recognized pricing service. We review the market prices provided by the broker-dealer for our securities for reasonableness based on our understanding of the marketplace and we consider any credit issues related to the securities. As we have not made any adjustments to the market quotes provided to us and they are based on observable market data, they have been categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
Investment securities held-to-maturity. 
Securities held-to-maturity at carried at amortized cost. In determining the fair value of securities held-to-maturity, we use the same methodology as for securities available-for-sale and they have been categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Total loans, net of allowance for credit losses. 
As loans and leases are not measured at fair value, the following discussion relates to estimating the fair value disclosures under ASC Topic 825. Loan fair values represent an exit price based upon the income approach. The loans are valued on an individual basis, with consideration given to the loans' underlying characteristics, including account types, remaining terms (in months), annual interest rates or coupons, interest types, past delinquencies, timing of principal and interest payments, current market rates, loan to value ratios, loss exposures, and remaining balances. Our model utilizes a discounted cash flow calculation to estimate the fair value of the loans using assumptions for the coupon rates, remaining maturities, prepayment speeds, projected default probabilities, loses given defaults, and estimates of prevailing discount rates. The discounted cash flow approach models the credit losses directly in the projected cash flows. The model applies various assumptions regarding credit, interest, and prepayment risks for the loans based on loan types, payment types and fixed or variable classifications. We typically classify loans as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

133

Derivative assets and liabilities. 
Derivatives are carried at fair value on a recurring basis and primarily relate to forward contracts which we enter into to manage interest rate risk. Our derivatives are principally traded in over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. Instead, the fair value is estimated using market observable inputs such as current forward contract rates, interest rate yield curves, volatilities and basis spreads. We also consider counter-party credit risk in valuing our derivatives. We typically classify our derivative assets and liabilities as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Interest-bearing deposits.
 Interest-bearing deposits are carried at historical cost. The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity date is equal to the amount payable on demand as of the balance sheet date and considered Level 2. The fair value of time deposits is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows and considered Level 2. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. No value has been separately assigned to the Company's long-term relationships with its deposit customers, such as a core deposit intangible.
Borrowings. 
Borrowings may include FHLB advances and other fixed-rate term borrowings. Borrowings are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of fixed-rate borrowings is estimated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the maturity date or call date, if applicable, using estimated market discount rates that reflect current rates offered for borrowings with similar remaining maturities and characteristics and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value estimates presented herein are based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments available to management as of December 31, 2024 and 2023
. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since that date, and therefore, current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented above.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
The Bank is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations and utilizes interest rate swap agreements (“swaps”) as part of its asset/liability management strategy to help manage its interest rate risk position. As of  December 31, 2024
 the Bank has entered into 
109
 interest-rate swap agreements with customers with a notional amount totaling $
363.4
 million. The Bank then entered into identical offsetting swaps with counterparties. The swap agreements are not designated as hedging instruments. The purpose of entering into offsetting derivatives not designated as a hedging instrument is to provide the Bank a variable-rate loan receivable and to provide the customer the financial effects of a fixed-rate loan without creating significant volatility in the Bank’s earnings.

The structure of the swaps is as follows. The Bank enters into an interest rate swap with its customers in which the Bank pays the customer a variable rate and the customer pays the Bank a fixed rate, therefore allowing customers to convert variable rate loans to fixed rate loans. At the same time, the Bank enters into a swap with a counterparty bank in which the Bank pays the counterparty a fixed rate and the counterparty in return pays the Bank a variable rate.  The net effect of the transaction allows the Bank to receive interest on the loan from the customer at a variable rate based on SOFR plus a spread. The changes in the fair value of the swaps primarily offset each other and therefore should not have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, although the Company does incur credit and counterparty risk with respect to performance on the swap agreements by the Bank’s customer and counterparty, respectively.  
These instruments contain language outlining collateral pledging requirements for each counterparty, in which collateral must be posted if market value exceeds certain agreed upon threshold limits.  Cash or securities are pledged as collateral.
  Our interest rate swap derivatives are subject to a master netting arrangement with our counterparties. 
No
ne of our derivative assets and liabilities are offset in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.

We believe our risk of loss associated with our counterparty borrowers related to interest rate swaps is mitigated as the loans with swaps are underwritten to take into account potential additional exposure, although there can be no assurances in this regard since the performance of our swaps is subject to market and counterparty risk.

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments

Fair Value Hedges

134

To manage interest rate risk on our AFS securities portfolio, we have entered into pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap contracts to hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of such securities resulting from changes in interest rates. We designate these interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging.
 We elected to account for the fair value hedges using the portfolio layer method in accordance with ASU 2022-01. We record the interest rate swaps in the line items "accrued interest receivable and other assets" and "other liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheet. For qualifying fair value hedges, both the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the portion of the fair value adjustments associated with the portfolio layer attributable to the hedged risk are recognized into earnings as they occur. Derivative amounts impacting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item in the line item "investment securities available for sale" as part of interest income, a component of consolidated net income.

In June 2023, fair value hedging transactions were executed in which $
1
 billion notional pay-fixed interest rate swaps were consummated with maturities ranging from 
four
 to 
five years
, wherein the Company pays a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 
3.8
% and receives daily SOFR. In December 2024, we terminated one of these swaps which had a notional value of $
300
 million, a maturity date of June 2027 and paid a fixed rate of 
3.95
%. The remaining $
700
 million notional pay-fixed interest rate swaps had a fair value which 
totale
d $
7.2
 million and was reflected as an asset at December 31, 2024.

Cash Flow Hedges

          To manage our interest rate risk associated with brokered CDs, FHLB advances or other fixed rate advances for specified periods, the Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts that are designated as qualifying cash flow hedges to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in contractually specified interest rates. During the first quarter of 2024, $
300
 million of 3-month term brokered CDs were issued and cash flow hedging transactions were also executed in which $
300
 million notional pay-fixed interest rate swaps were consummated with maturities of three years, wherein the Company pays a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 
4.2
% and receives daily SOFR.

           To qualify for hedge accounting, a formal assessment is prepared to determine whether the hedging relationship, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge if a cash flow hedge. At inception a statistical regression analysis is prepared to determine hedge effectiveness. At each reporting period thereafter, a statistical regression or qualitative analysis is performed to determine hedge effectiveness. If it is determined that hedge effectiveness has not been or will not continue to be highly effective, then hedge accounting ceases and any gain or loss in AOCI is recognized in earnings immediately. The cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in AOCI, net of tax. All related cash flows are reported in the operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows. Amounts recorded to AOCI are reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged asset or liability affects earnings and are presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged asset or liability.

BALANCE SHEET OFFSETTING 

Assets and liabilities relating to certain financial instruments including derivatives and securities sold under repurchase agreements (“repurchase agreements”), may be eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheets as permitted under accounting guidance. As noted above, our interest rate swap derivatives are subject to master netting arrangements. Our interest rate swap derivatives require the Company to pledge investment securities as collateral based on certain risk thresholds. Investment securities that have been pledged by the Company to counterparties continue to be reported in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets unless the Company defaults. We offer a repurchase agreement product to our customers, which include master netting agreements that allow for the netting of collateral positions. This product, known as Citizens Sweep Manager, sells certain of our securities overnight to our customers under an agreement to repurchase them the next day. The repurchase agreements are not offset in the Company’s consolidated balances.

In June 2023, fair value hedging transactions were executed in which $
1
 billion notional pay-fixed interest rate swaps were consummated with maturities ranging from 
four
 to 
five years
, wherein the Company pays a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 
3.8
% and receives daily SOFR. In December 2024, we terminated one of these swaps which had a notional value of $
300
 million, a maturity date of June 2027 and paid a fixed rate of 
3.95
%. The remaining $
700
 million notional pay-fixed interest rate swaps had a fair value which totale
d $
7.2
 mi
llion and was reflected as an asset on December 31, 2024.  Refer to Note 18 –

LEASES

All of the Company’s operating leases, where the Company is a lessee, are for real estate, such as office space and banking centers. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

While the Company has, as a lessor, certain equipment finance leases, such leases are not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The tables below present the components of lease costs and supplemental information related to leases as of and for the periods presented.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

ASU No. 2014-09 “
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
” and all subsequent ASUs that modified Topic 606 requires revenue that is derived from a contract with a customer to be recognized when the Company satisfies the related performance obligations by transferring to the customer a good or service.

Topic 606 does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including interest and the gain/(loss) on the sale of loans and securities. In addition, certain noninterest income streams such as BOLI income and fees associated with mortgage servicing rights, financial guarantees, derivatives, and certain credit card fees are also not in scope of the new guidance. Topic 606 is applicable to noninterest revenue streams such as trust and asset management income, deposit related fees, interchange fees, and merchant income. However, the recognition of these revenue streams did not change significantly upon adoption of Topic 606. Noninterest revenue streams in-scope of Topic 606 are discussed below.

Trust and Investment Services

Trust and asset management income is primarily comprised of fees earned from the management and administration of trusts and customer assets. The Company’s performance obligation is generally satisfied over time and the resulting fees are recognized monthly, based upon the monthly market value of the assets under management and the applicable fee rate. Payment is generally received at month end through a direct charge to customers’ accounts. The Company does not earn performance-based incentives. Other services related to real estate and tax return preparation services are also provided to existing trust and asset management customers. The Company’s performance obligation for these transactional-based services is generally satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time (i.e., as incurred). Payment is received shortly after services are rendered.

Wealth Management contracts with customers have no clauses that would entitle customers to additional services. Fees are generally earned based on market value of assets under management and miscellaneous fees are transaction driven and are charged based on an agreed upon fee schedule. Performance obligation is satisfied upon execution of the transaction and there is no need to allocate transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract. Wealth Management customers can also terminate the contract at will.

For Investment Services, the fees are earned based on services performed for customers as provided through an affiliated broker-dealer. Fees are earned from gross dealer commission based on trade date. Performance obligation is satisfied upon execution of the transaction and there is no need to allocate transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract.

Deposit-related Fees

Service charges on deposit accounts consist of account analysis fees earned on analyzed business checking accounts, monthly service fees, and other deposit account related fees. The Company’s performance obligation for account analysis fees and monthly service fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, over the period in which the service is provided. Other deposit account related fees are largely transactional based, and therefore, the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time. Payment for service charges on deposit accounts is primarily received immediately or in the following month through a direct charge to customers’ accounts.
Bankcard Services

The Bank generates revenues from merchant servicing to its clients. A fee schedule is part of the contract and is calculated based on sales of merchants on a monthly basis. There is no future promise or claim to deliver services as merchant fees are based on monthly merchant transactions. The Company’s performance obligations are largely satisfied, and related revenue recognized, when the services are rendered or upon completion. Payment is typically received immediately or in the following month.

Contract Acquisition Costs

In connection with the adoption of Topic 606, an entity is required to capitalize, and subsequently amortize into expense, certain incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if these costs are expected to be recovered. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that an entity incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained (for example, sales commission). The Company utilizes the practical expedient, which allows entities to immediately expense contract acquisition costs when the asset that would have resulted from capitalizing these costs would have been amortized in one year or less.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

CVB Financial Corp.:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CVB Financial Corp. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Assessment of the allowance for credit losses for loans evaluated on a collective basis using the Commercial Real Estate methodology

As discussed in Note 3 and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total allowance for credit losses as December 31, 2024, was $80.12 million, a substantial portion of which relates to the allowance for credit losses on loans evaluated on a collective basis using the commercial real estate methodology (commercial ACL). The commercial ACL includes the measure of expected credit losses on a collective basis by pooling those loans that share similar risk characteristics into segments. The commercial ACL methodology includes an estimation framework that uses loss experience of data sets of unique loans to derive lifetime loss rates at the pool level during the average life, inclusive of prepayments. The methodology to estimate the commercial ACL is largely driven by portfolio characteristics, including loss history, original loan-to-value ratios, and macroeconomic variables and the associated economic outlook. The commercial ACL incorporates a reasonable and supportable forecast of various macroeconomic variables over the remaining average life of the loan. The forecast incorporates an assumption that each

145

macroeconomic variable will revert to a long-term expectation, starting in years 2-3, of the reasonable and supportable forecast period, with the reversion largely completed within the first five years of the forecast. The commercial ACL methodology incorporates unique macroeconomic variables based on risk drivers to the underlying portfolio. The Company reviews current conditions and forecasts to determine whether adjustments are needed to ensure that the life of loan loss rates reflect both the current state of the portfolio, and expectations for macroeconomic changes.

We identified the assessment of the December 31, 2024 commercial ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment due to significant measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the commercial ACL methodology, including the method used to estimate lifetime loss rates and the key assumptions: portfolio segmentation, the economic forecast scenarios and their weightings and macroeconomic variables, and the length of the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The assessment also included the evaluation of the adjustments performed to align the life of loan loss rates with the current state of the portfolio. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s measurement of the commercial ACL estimate, including controls over the:

•
development of the commercial ACL methodology

•
development of the lifetime loss rate methodology

•
ongoing monitoring of the lifetime loss rate methodology

•
identification and determination of the key assumptions used in the lifetime loss rate methodology

•
development of the adjustments performed to align the life of loan loss rates with the current state of the portfolio

•
analysis of the commercial ACL results, trends, and ratios.

We evaluated the Company’s process to develop the commercial ACL estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:

•
evaluating the commercial ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles

•
evaluating judgments made relative to the development and performance monitoring of the lifetime loss rate methodology, including prepayments, by comparing them to Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory guidance

•
assessing the conceptual soundness and performance of the lifetime loss rate methodology, including their key assumptions, to determine whether the methodology was suitable for its intended use

•
evaluating the weighted economic forecast scenarios and underlying assumptions driving the macroeconomic variable changes, including the determination of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and weightings used by comparing it to the Company’s business environment and relevant industry practice

•
determining whether the loan portfolio is segmented by similar risk characteristics by comparing to specific portfolio risk characteristics and trends

•
evaluating the methodology used to develop the adjustments and the effect of those adjustments on the commercial ACL compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying pool level metrics.

146

We also assessed the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained related to the December 31, 2024 commercial ACL by evaluating the:

•
cumulative results of the audit procedures

•
qualitative aspects of the Company’s accounting practices

•
potential bias in the accounting estimate
