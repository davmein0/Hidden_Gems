Item 5.	MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our Class A Common Stock (“Class A Common Stock”) trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol “HUBG.” There is no established trading market for shares of our Class B Common Stock (the “Class B Common Stock” together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Common Stock”).

On February 18, 2025, there were approximately 398 stockholders of record of the Class A Common Stock and in addition, there were an estimated 45,944 beneficial owners of the Class A Common Stock whose shares were held by brokers and other fiduciary institutions. On February 18, 2025, there were 10 holders of record of our Class B Common Stock.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

On January 4, 2024, we announced a two-for-one stock split of our Class A and Class B common stock. Refer to the Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the effect of this stock split.

In October 2023, the Board authorized the purchase of up to $250 million of our Class A Common Stock pursuant to a share repurchase program (the 
“
2023 Program
”
). Under the 2023 Program, the shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, from time to time subject to market and other conditions. The approved share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares and the program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.

We purchased 39,364 shares of Class A Common Stock for $1.7 million related to employee withholding upon vesting of restricted stock in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 56,564 shares for $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Item 7. 	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We are a leading supply chain solutions provider in North America that offers comprehensive transportation and logistics management services focused on reliability, visibility and value for our customers. Our service offerings include a full range of freight transportation and logistics services, some of which are provided using assets we own and operate, and some of which are provided by third parties with whom we contract. Our services include intermodal, truckload, less-than-truckload, flatbed, temperature-controlled, dedicated and regional trucking. Other services include full outsource logistics solutions, transportation management services, consolidation and fulfillment services, final mile delivery, parcel and international services.

We service a large and diversified customer base in a broad range of industries, including retail, consumer products and durable goods. We believe our strategy to offer multi-modal supply chain management solutions serves to strengthen and deepen our relationships with our customers and allows us to provide a more cost effective and higher service solution.

We concluded we have two reportable segments - Intermodal and Transportation Solutions (“ITS”), and Logistics, which are based primarily on the services each segment provides.

Intermodal and Transportation Solutions. 
Our ITS segment offers high service, nationwide door-to-door intermodal transportation, providing value, visibility and reliability in both transcontinental and local lanes by combining rail transportation with local trucking. This segment includes our trucking operations which provides our customers with local pickup and delivery as well as high service local and regional trucking transportation using equipment dedicated to their needs. In 2024, approximately 73% of our drayage services was provided by our own fleet. We arrange for the movement of our customers’ freight in one of our approximately 50,000 containers. We contract with railroads to provide transportation for the long-haul portion of the shipment between rail terminals. Drayage between origin or destination and rail terminals are provided by our own trucking operations and third parties with whom we contract. Our dedicated service operation offers fleets of equipment and drivers to each customer on a contract basis, as well as the management and infrastructure to operate according to the customer’s high service expectations. As of December 31, 2024, our trucking transportation operation consisted of approximately 2,300 tractors, 3,200 employee drivers and 4,700 trailers. We also contract for services with approximately 500 independent owner-operators. These assets and contractual services are used to support drayage for our intermodal service offering and to serve our customers who require high service local and regional trucking transportation using equipment dedicated to their needs. Our dedicated service operation offers fleets of equipment and drivers to each customer on a contract basis, as well as the management and infrastructure to operate according to the customer’s high service expectations.

Logistics
. Our Logistics segment offers a wide range of non-asset-based services including transportation management, freight brokerage services, shipment optimization, load consolidation, mode selection, carrier management, load planning and execution, cross-docking, consolidation and fulfillment services and final mile delivery. Logistics includes our brokerage business which consists of a full range of trucking transportation services, including dry van, expedited, less-than-truckload (“LTL”), refrigerated and flatbed, all of which is provided by third-party carriers with whom we contract. We leverage proprietary technology along with collaborative relationships with third-party service providers to deliver cost savings and performance-enhancing supply chain services to our clients. Our transportation management offering also serves as a source of volume for our ITS segment. Many of the customers for these solutions are consumer goods companies who sell into the retail channel. Our final mile delivery offering provides residential final mile delivery and installation of appliances and big and bulky goods. Final mile operates through a network of independent service providers in company, customer and third-party facilities throughout the continental United States. Our business operates or has access to approximately 7 million square feet of warehousing and cross-dock space across North America, to which our customers ship their goods to be stored and distributed to destinations including residences, retail stores and other commercial locations. These services offer our customers shipment visibility, transportation cost savings, high service and compliance with retailers’ increasingly stringent supply chain requirements.

We are focused on several margin enhancement projects including network optimization, matching of inbound and outbound loads, reducing empty miles, improving our recovery of accessorial costs, increasing our driver and asset utilization, reducing repositioning costs, providing holistic solutions and improving low profit freight. Hub’s top 50 customers represent approximately 68% of revenue for fiscal 2024 while one customer accounted for more than 10% of our annual revenue in 2024 in both segments. We use various performance indicators to manage our business. We closely monitor profit levels for our customers. We also evaluate on-time performance, customer service, cost per load and daily sales outstanding by customer account. Vendor cost changes and vendor service levels are also monitored closely.

22

Uncertainties and risks to our outlook include inflation, increased healthcare costs, a slowdown in consumer spending (driven by, among other factors, rising inflation, tariffs, increases in interest rates, an economic recession and geopolitical concerns), a shift by consumers to spending on services at the expense of goods, an increase of retailers’ inventory levels, the ability of customers to pay our accounts receivable, a significant increase in transportation supply in the marketplace, aggressive pricing actions by our competitors and any inability to pass cost increases, such as transportation and warehouse costs, through to our customers, economic factors such as the impact of potentially increasing tariffs between trading partners, all of which could have a materially negative impact on our revenue, profitability and cash flow in 2025.  Exiting of truckload capacity, retail inventory levels declining leading to restocking demand, a return of typical shipping peak season demands and a stronger used tractor market could have a materially positive impact on our revenue, profitability and cash flows in 2025.

Strategic Transactions

On October 23, 2024, we entered into an investment agreement with Corporación Interamericana de Logística, S.A. de C.V. and certain associated entities (commonly known as “EASO”), to acquire a controlling interest in EASO. The estimated fair value of total consideration transferred was approximately $55 million for a 51% equity stake in EASO.

On December 20, 2023, we acquired 100% of the equity interests of Forward Air Final Mile (“FAFM”). Total consideration for the transaction was approximately $257.2 million in cash.

On August 22, 2022, we acquired 100% of the equity interests of 
TAGG.
 Total consideration for the transaction was approximately $103.4 million in cash.

Total consolidated operating revenue decreased 6% to $3.9 billion in 2024 from $4.2 billion in 2023.

Intermodal and Transportation Solutions (“ITS”) revenue decreased 10% to $2.2 billion primarily due to a 15% decline in intermodal revenue per load (primarily due to lower prices, lower fuel surcharges, accessorial revenue and mix), partially offset by a 5% increase in intermodal volumes and a 1% growth in dedicated revenues due to customers onboarded in late 2023.

ITS operating income decreased to $57 million, 2.5% of revenue, as compared to $107 million, 4.3% of revenue in the prior year due to lower customer rates in intermodal, lower accessorial income and more normalized bonus expense for employees. These headwinds were partially offset by lower drayage costs and lower equipment costs.

23

Logistics revenue remained consistent at $1.8 billion primarily driven by lower revenue per load in our brokerage service line, lower volumes in our brokerage business and lower revenue in our managed transportation and consolidation and fulfillment services. This was partially offset by growth in our final mile business due to the FAFM acquisition in late 2023.

Logistics operating income was 4.6% of revenue in 2024 compared to 5.8% in 2023. Lower revenue was partially offset by lower purchased transportation costs and a change of business mix between our lines of business. Operating income was $83 million as compared to $105 million last year driven by lower yields in brokerage and we incurred approximately $13 million of incremental costs related to warehouse consolidation to provide better customer service, our network alignment initiative within consolidation and fulfillment.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSES

Purchased Transportation and Warehousing

Purchased transportation and warehousing costs decreased 7% to $2.9 billion in 2024 from $3.1 billion in 2023. As a percentage of revenue, purchased transportation and warehousing costs decreased to 74.2% in 2024 versus 74.8% in 2023 due to cost control initiatives.

Purchased transportation and warehousing costs declined as compared to prior year due to lower volumes in brokerage, and reductions in third party carrier costs, partially offset by network alignment costs.

Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and benefits increased to $577 million in 2024 from $553 million in 2023. As a percentage of revenue, salaries and benefits increased to 14.6% in 2024 from 13.2% in 2023.

 This expense increase was due primarily to the FAFM acquisition on December 20, 2023 and the EASO transaction on October 23, 2024, as well as an increase in incentive compensation expense of $8 million, partially offset by decreases in driver related expenses of $15 million related to lower average driver headcount, lower office compensation expense of $7 million and lower restricted stock expense of $3 million.

Headcount, which includes drivers, warehouse personnel and office employees, was 6,471 as of December 31, 2024, which included 477 employees of EASO. As of December 31, 2023, headcount was 5,956. The increase in headcount was due primarily to the EASO transaction.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $141 million in 2024 from $144 million in 2023. This expense decrease was primarily due to decreased container depreciation expense resulting from changes made in the third quarter of 2024 to the estimated useful lives of our containers as well as decreased tractor depreciation expense resulting from a smaller tractor fleet in 2024. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in amortization expense of intangibles related to the FAFM acquisition and the EASO transaction. This expense, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 3.6% in 2024 from 3.4% in 2023. Depreciation expense includes transportation equipment, technology investments, leasehold improvements, warehouse equipment, office equipment and building improvements. Amortization expense includes trade names, customer relationships, carrier network relationships, independent contractor relationships, developed technology and carrier and independent service provider relationships.

24

Insurance and Claims

Insurance and claims expense decreased to $44 million in 2024 from $49 million in 2023. This expense decrease was primarily due to less claim expenses related to both auto liability and workers compensation claims in 2024. These expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 1.1% in 2024 from 1.2% in 2023.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses increased to $114 million in 2024 from $106 million in 2023. These expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 2.9% in 2024 from 2.5% in 2023.

This expense increase was primarily due increased expenses from FAFM, which incurred twelve months of expenses in 2024 as compared to less than a month of expenses in 2023, increased expenses from EASO which was acquired in October 2024, as well as increases in rent expense, use tax expense, legal expense and IT service expense. These increases were partially offset by the non-recurrence of an impairment of a right-of-use asset and a decrease in bad debt expense.

Gain on Sale of Assets, Net

Net gains on the sale of equipment decreased to $1 million in 2024 from $7 million in 2023. This decrease resulted from both less units sold and a lower average gain per unit sold in 2024 as compared to 2023.

Other Income (Expense)

Other expense, net increased to $8 million in 2024 from $3 million in 2023. The change was driven by decreased interest income in 2024 primarily due to lower average cash balances throughout the year. Interest expense increased to $14 million in 2024 from $13 million in 2023 driven by higher interest rates on our debt, partially offset by lower average debt balances.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes decreased to $29 million in 2024 from $42 million in 2023 due to a decrease in pre-tax income. We provided for income taxes using an effective rate of 21.5% in 2024 and an effective rate of 19.9% in 2023. The effective tax rate was higher in 2024 because there were significant refund claims made in 2023 related to a change in state apportionment methodology that did not reoccur in 2024.

Total consolidated operating revenue decreased 21% to $4.2 billion in 2023 from $5.3 billion in 2022.

Intermodal and Transportation Solutions (“ITS”) revenue decreased 25% to $2.5 billion primarily due to a 14% decrease in intermodal volume due to low transportation demand and an oversupply of truckload carrier capacity, a 14% decrease in intermodal revenue per load (primarily due to lower price, fuel prices and mix) and a 4% decline in dedicated revenues due to lost customers partially offset by growth with existing and new customers.

ITS operating income decreased to $107 million, 4.3% of revenue, as compared to $349 million, 10.5% of revenue in the prior year due to lower volume, lower customer rates, and lower surcharges and accessorial income. These headwinds were partially offset by lower drayage costs as we increased the portion of drayage handled on our own fleet to 78% in 2023 as compared to 55% in the prior year, as well as an improvement in profitability at our dedicated trucking service line.

 Logistics revenue decreased 14% to $1.8 billion primarily driven by lower revenue per load in our brokerage service line and lower managed transportation and final mile service line revenue, partially offset by an increase in consolidation and fulfillment revenue. Brokerage volumes were flat compared to the prior year. Logistics operating income was 6% of revenue in both 2023 and 2022. Operating income was $105 million as compared to $126 million last year, as lower revenue was partially offset by lower purchased transportation costs and our yield management initiatives.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSES

Purchased Transportation and Warehousing

Purchased transportation and warehousing costs decreased 22% to $3.1 billion in 2023 from $4.0 billion in 2022. As a percentage of revenue, purchased transportation and warehousing costs decreased to 74.8% in 2023 versus 75.6% in 2022 due to cost control initiatives and less third-party drayage usage.

Purchased transportation and warehousing costs declined as compared to prior year due to lower volumes, reductions in third party carrier costs and decreased use of third-party carriers for drayage in ITS.

Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and benefits increased to $553 million in 2023 from $543 million in 2022. As a percentage of revenue, salaries and benefits increased to 13.2% in 2023 from 10.2% in 2022.

 This increase was primarily due to $81 million of incremental expense related to the increase of our average company driver count and warehouse employees. The increase includes a $5 million increase in medical benefits, as well as increased expenses resulting from TAGG, which incurred twelve months of expenses in 2023 as compared to just over seven months of expenses in 2022 and FAFM which was acquired in December 2023. These increases were partially offset by a $71 million reduction in office employee compensation due to lower headcount and lower incentive compensation expense.

Headcount, which includes drivers, warehouse personnel and office employees, was 5,956, which includes 641 employees of FAFM, as of December 31, 2023 and 5,921 as of December 31, 2022. The increase in headcount was due primarily to the acquisition of FAFM partially offset by decreases in both office employees and company drivers.

26

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $144 million in 2023 from $132 million in 2022. This increase was primarily due to increased container, tractor and warehouse equipment depreciation expense as well as the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of TAGG and FAFM. This expense, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 3.4% in 2023 from 2.5% in 2022. Depreciation expense includes transportation equipment, technology investments, leasehold improvements, warehouse equipment, office equipment and building improvements.

Insurance and Claims

Insurance and claims expense decreased to $49 million in 2023 from $58 million in 2022. This decrease was primarily due to less claim expenses related to both auto liability and workers compensation claims in 2023. These expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 1.2% in 2023 from 1.1% in 2022.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses decreased to $106 million in 2023 from $121 million in 2022. These expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 2.5% in 2023 from 2.2% in 2022.

This expense decrease was primarily due to less impairment of a right-of-use asset and decreases in use tax expense, outside sales commissions, bad debt expense and professional services expense including IT software expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher rent expense, the closing costs related to the FAFM acquisition, higher temporary labor expense as well as increased expenses resulting from TAGG, which incurred twelve months of expenses in 2023 as compared to just over four months of expenses in 2022 and FAFM which was acquired in December 2023.

Gain on Sale of Assets, Net

Net gains on the sale of equipment decreased to $7 million in 2023 from $24 million in 2022. This decrease resulted from both less units sold and a lower average gain per unit sold in 2023 as compared to 2022. We expect gains in 2024 to continue to be lower than prior years due to a softer used tractor market.

Other Income (Expense)

Other Expense decreased to $3 million in 2023 from $7 million in 2022. Interest expense increased to $13 million in 2023 from $7 million in 2022 due primarily to higher interest rates on our debt and higher average debt balances. The expense increase was partially offset by increased interest income of $10 million in 2023 due to higher interest rates on our cash balance and higher cash balances throughout the year.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes decreased to $42 million in 2023 from $111 million in 2022 due to a decrease in pre-tax income. We provided for income taxes using an effective rate of 19.9% in 2023 and an effective rate of 23.7% in 2022. The lower effective tax rate in 2023 resulted primarily from a change in state apportionment methodology.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our financing and liquidity strategy is to fund operating cash payments and future dividends through cash received from the provision of services, cash on hand, and to a lesser extent, from cash received from the sale of equipment. As of December 31, 2024, we had $98 million of cash and cash equivalents. We also had $29 million of restricted cash and $22 million of restricted investments which are held for payments of long-term liabilities. We generally fund our purchases of transportation equipment through the issuance of secured, fixed rate Equipment Notes. In prior years, we have funded our business acquisitions from cash on hand. Our investment agreement with EASO in October 2024 is consistent with this approach. Payments for our other investing activities, such as the construction of our office buildings and our capitalized technology investments, have been funded by cash on hand or cash flows from operations. Cash used in financing activities including the purchase of treasury stock and dividend payments have been funded by cash from operations or cash on hand. We have not historically used our Credit Facility to fund our operating, investing, or financing cash needs, though it is available to fund future cash requirements as needed. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe cash on hand and cash received from the provision of services, along with other financing sources, will provide us the necessary capital to fund transactions and achieve our planned growth for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.

Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was approximately $194 million, which resulted from non-cash charges of $196 million and income of $104 million, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $106 million.

27

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $194 million in 2024 compared to $422 million in 2023. The $228 million decrease in cash flow was primarily due to a decrease in the change in assets and liabilities of $150 million, a decrease in net income of $64 million and a decrease in non-cash charges of $14 million.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $53 million which included capital expenditures of $51 million and net cash used in acquisitions of $14 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of equipment of $12 million. Capital expenditures of $51 million related primarily to technology investments of $19 million, tractor purchases of $16 million, warehouse equipment of $9 million and the remainder for other transportation equipment.

Capital expenditures decreased by approximately $89 million in 2024 as compared to 2023. The 2024 decrease was due to decreases in tractor purchases of $54 million, container purchases of $39 million, warehouse purchases of $3 million and the remainder related to leasehold improvements. These decreases were partially offset by increased technology investments of $5 million and increased purchases of other transportation equipment of $4 million.

In 2025, we estimate capital expenditures will range from $50 million to $70 million. We expect transportation equipment purchases to range from $25 million to $45 million, technology investments of approximately $25 million as well as warehouse equipment and other expenditures. We plan to fund these expenditures with a combination of cash and debt.

Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $201 million which includes cash used for the repayments of long-term debt of $107 million, purchase of treasury stock of $68 million, dividends paid of $30 million, cash used for stock tendered for payments of withholding taxes of $11 million, finance lease payments of $2 million and a distribution to non-controlling interest holders of $1 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of debt of $18 million. Our debt balance decreased by $86 million during 2024. Debt incurred in 2024 was used to fund the purchase of transportation equipment.

The $53 million increase in cash used in financing activities for 2024 versus 2023 was primarily due to an increase in dividends paid of $30 million, increases in repayments of long-term debt, distributions to non-controlling interests and cash paid for stock related to employee withholding taxes of $1 million each and a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of debt of $96 million, partially offset by a decrease in the purchase of treasury stock of $75 million.

In 2024, cash paid for income taxes was $44 million, of which $34 million related to 2024 and $10 million related to 2023. The $34 million of cash paid for income taxes related to 2024 was more than the 2024 income tax expense of $29 million. This difference is a result of unfavorable book to tax differences, primarily those related to depreciation, which caused 2024 taxable income to be more than 2024 financial statement income before taxes. We expect our cash payments for income taxes in 2025 to exceed our income tax expense.

See Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements for details related to interest rates and commitment fees.

We have standby letters of credit that expire in 2025. Our letters of credit were $1 million as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no borrowings under our respective credit agreements. Our unused and available borrowings were $349 million as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We were in compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreements as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. In certain circumstances, those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. We have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. The following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and estimates. These critical accounting policies are further discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, which describes these and our other significant accounting policies.

29

Revenue Recognition

In accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” our significant accounting policy for revenue is as follows:

Revenue is recognized when we transfer services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. We generally recognize revenue over time because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. Since control is transferred over time, revenue and related transportation costs are recognized based on relative transit time, which is based on the extent of progress towards completion of the related performance obligation. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of services, which are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by us from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Further, in most cases, we report our revenue on a gross basis because we are the primary obligor as we are responsible for providing the service desired by the customer. Our customers view us as responsible for fulfillment including the acceptability of the service. Service requirements may include, for example, on-time delivery, handling freight loss and damage claims, setting appointments for pick-up and delivery and tracing shipments in transit. We have discretion in setting prices for our services and as a result, the amount we earn varies. In addition, we have the discretion to select our vendors from multiple suppliers for the services ordered by our customers. Due to these factors, we report revenue on a gross basis for most of our revenue.

Allowance for Uncollectible Trade Accounts

We extend credit to customers after a review of each customer’s credit profile and history. An allowance for uncollectible trade accounts has been established through an analysis of the accounts receivable aging, an assessment of collectability based on historical trends and an evaluation based on current economic conditions. Annually we review, in hindsight, the percentage of receivables that are collected that aged over one year, those that are not one year old and the accounts that went into bankruptcy. We reserve for accounts less than one year old based on specifically identified uncollectible balances and our historic collection percentage, including receivable adjustments charged through revenue for items such as billing disputes. In establishing a reserve for certain account balances specifically identified as uncollectible, we consider the aging of the customer receivables, the specific details as to why the receivable has not been paid, the customer’s current and projected financial results, the customer’s ability to meet and sustain its financial commitments, the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook and the general economic conditions. Our historical collection percentage has been over 98% on average for receivables that are less than one year old. Changes in our historical collection percentages of receivables that are less than one year old either positively or negatively, based on our collection history, would affect our calculated allowance for uncollectible trade accounts.

Once a receivable ages over one year, our collection percentage is much lower, thus a separate allowance is calculated for open receivables that have aged over one year. We also review our collection percentage after a customer has gone into bankruptcy. Although these collection percentages may change both negatively and positively, since only a small portion of our receivables are aged over one year or are involved in a bankruptcy case, a large change in either of those collection percentages would not have a material impact on our financial statements. Our level of reserves for customer accounts receivable fluctuates depending upon all the factors mentioned above. Historically, our reserve for uncollectible accounts has approximated actual accounts written off and we do not expect the reserve for uncollectible accounts to change significantly relative to our accounts receivable balance. The allowance for uncollectible accounts is reported on the balance sheet in net accounts receivable. Recoveries of receivables previously charged off are recorded when received.

Claims Accruals

We purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries, vehicular collisions, accidents, and cargo damage. Certain insurance arrangements include high SIR limits or deductibles applicable to each claim. We have umbrella policies to limit our exposure above these SIR limits and deductibles.

30

Our claims accrual policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by third-party claims administrators, as well as legal and regulatory factors. Our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies and third-party administrators to continually update the estimated cost of each claim. The ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature, timing, and extent of damages claimed becomes available. Accordingly, we use actuarial methods to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability. This process involves the use of loss-development factors based on our historical claims experience. In doing so, the recorded liability considers future claims growth and provides an allowance for incurred-but-not-reported claims. Changes in loss development factors caused by differences between the estimates of future medical costs, future severity trend factors and future legal costs could materially change our recorded claim accrual liability. Our claim accrual liability is classified as either current or non-current in the consolidated balance sheet based on an estimate of when the claims are expected to be paid. We do not discount our estimated losses. In addition, we record receivables for amounts expected to be reimbursed for payments made in excess of self-insurance levels on covered claims.

Item 7A. 	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk:
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. We maintain a bank line of credit and have both fixed and variable rate debt as described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Any material increase in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk:
 We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the Mexican Peso, which may affect our net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes.

A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Mexican Peso would have had an impact of approximately $2 million on our 2024 operating revenue. This amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net income impact due to partially offsetting impacts on operating expenses in those currencies. A hypothetical 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Mexican Peso would have had an impact of approximately $10 million on our consolidated foreign net assets as of December 31, 2024.

EPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Hub Group, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hub Group, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(b) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 25, 2025
 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

     Claims Accruals

Description of the Matter

At December 31, 2024, the Company’s aggregate accrued liability related to auto and workers’ compensation claims, inclusive of amounts expected to be paid above its self-insured retention limits, was $38.5 million. As explained in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes a liability at the time of an incident based upon the nature and severity of the claim and analyses provided by third-party claims administrators. The Company utilizes actuarial methods to estimate this liability.

Auditing the Company's claims accruals is complex due to the uncertainty associated with the claims, the application of significant management judgment, and the use of actuarial methods. In addition, the estimate of the accrual can fluctuate based on the assumptions used in the actuarial studies, including the frequency and severity of claims, the loss development factors for existing claims and the estimates of incurred but not reported claims. These assumptions have a significant effect on the claims accruals.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the claims accrual process. For example, we tested the controls over management’s assessment of the assumptions and underlying data used in the determination of the measurement and valuation of the reserve.
To evaluate the claims accruals, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims data. Furthermore, we involved our actuarial specialist to assist in our evaluation of the methodologies applied and significant assumptions used by the Company in determining the calculated liability. We then compared the Company’s recorded liability amount to a range which our actuarial specialist developed based on independently selected assumptions.

HUB GROUP, INC.

N
OTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business
: Hub Group, Inc. (the “Company”, “Hub”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading supply chain solutions provider that offers comprehensive transportation and logistics management services focused on reliability, visibility and value for our customers. Our service offerings include a full range of freight transportation and logistics services, some of which are provided using assets we own and operate, and some of which are provided by third parties with whom we contract. Our transportation services include intermodal, truckload, less-than-truckload, flatbed, temperature-controlled, dedicated and regional trucking. Our logistics services include full outsource logistics solutions, transportation management services, consolidation and fulfillment services, final mile delivery, parcel and international services.
On October 23, 2024, we entered into an investment agreement with Corporación Interamericana de Logística, S.A. de C.V. (“CIL”) and certain associated entities (commonly known as “EASO”) whereby we acquired a 
51
% controlling interest. On December 20, 2023, we acquired Forward Air Final Mile (“FAFM”). On August 22, 2022, we acquired 
TAGG Logistics, LLC (“TAGG”). 
Refer to Note 4 
“Business Combinations”
 for additional information.

Principles of Consolidation
: The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and all entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which we are the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation, and net income are reduced by the portion of net income attributable to non-controlling interests.

Variable Interest Entities:
 We consolidate all variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. We identify the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the entity. In addition, we consider the nature of relationships and activities of the parties involved and, where necessary, determine which party within a related-party group is most closely associated with the VIE and would therefore be considered the primary beneficiary. We determine primary beneficiary status of a VIE at the time of investment and perform ongoing reassessments to evaluate whether changes in the entity’s capital structure or changes in the nature of its involvement with the entity result in a change to the VIE designation or a change to its consolidation conclusion. Our economic interest in CIL includes an allocation of income or loss proportional to our relative ownership interest.
Non-controlling Interests: 
Non-controlling interests (“NCI”) reflect the portion of income or loss and the corresponding equity attributable to third-party equity holders and employees in certain consolidated entities that are not 
100
% owned by the Company. Non-controlling interests are presented as separate components of stockholders’ equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets to clearly distinguish between our interests and the economic interests of third parties and employees in those entities. Net income attributable to Hub Group, Inc., as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, is presented net of the portion of net income attributable to holders of non-controlling interests.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
: We consider as cash equivalents all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, our cash and temporary investments were with high quality financial institutions in demand deposit accounts (“DDAs”), savings accounts, checking accounts and money market accounts.
Restricted Cash
: Restricted cash includes cash held in both deposit accounts and escrow accounts that are not subject to remeasurement on a recurring basis, which are restricted under certain investment agreements as to future use.
Foreign Currency
: Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates while revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at average monthly exchange rates over the period. Equity is translated primarily at historical exchange rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

39

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts: 
The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the trade receivables’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the receivables. Trade receivables are charged off against the allowance when we believe the uncollectibility of a receivable balance is confirmed, and the expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. Management continuously reviews and assesses the environment and its potential impact on the credit worthiness and collectability of our accounts receivable with customers most affected by tighter financial conditions. Our allowance for credit losses is presented in the allowance for uncollectible trade accounts and is immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The allowance for uncollectible trade accounts also includes estimated adjustments to revenue for items such as billing disputes. Our reserve for uncollectible accounts was approximately $
26.7
 million and $
34.7
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively. Receivables are written off once collection efforts have been exhausted. Recoveries of receivables previously charged off are recorded when received.
Property and Equipment
: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method at rates adequate to depreciate the cost of the applicable assets over their expected useful lives: building and improvements, up to 
40
 years; leasehold improvements, 
the shorter of useful life or lease term
; computer equipment and software, up to 
10
 years; furniture and equipment, up to 
10
 years; and transportation equipment up to 
20
 years. Direct costs related to internally developed software projects are capitalized and amortized over their expected useful life on a straight-line basis not to exceed 
10 
years. Interest is capitalized on qualifying assets under development for internal use. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred and major improvements are capitalized. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the accumulated depreciation thereon are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss realized upon sale or disposal charged or credited to operations.

We routinely evaluate the useful life attributed to our assets. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we determined that the useful lives of certain transportation equipment should be increased to 
20
 years based on historical experience related to the use of this equipment and our expectation of its future usability. In addition, we changed the estimated salvage values of the transportation equipment to reflect current expectations at the end of the revised useful life. We accounted for these items as changes in estimate that were applied prospectively, effective as of July 1, 2024. These changes in estimate resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense of $
10.0
 million, an increase to net income of $
7.9
 million and an increase in both basic and diluted earnings per share of $
0.13
, during the six months ended December 31, 2024.

We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the event that the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the assets carrying amount over its fair value, less cost to dispose, is recorded.

Capitalized Internal Use Software and Cloud Computing Costs:
 We capitalize internal and external costs, which include costs related to the development of our cloud computing or hosting arrangements, incurred to develop internal use software per ASC Subtopic 350-40. Internal use software has both of the following characteristics: the software is acquired, internally developed, or modified solely to meet our needs and during the development or modification, no substantive plan exists or is being developed to market the software externally. Only costs incurred during the application development stage and costs to develop or obtain software that allows for access to or conversion of old data by new systems are capitalized. Capitalization of costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete, management has committed to funding the project and it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform its intended function. The measurement of the costs to capitalize include fees paid to third parties, costs incurred to obtain software from third parties, travel expenses incurred by employees in their duties associated with developing software, payroll related costs for employees who spend time directly on the project and interest costs incurred while developing internal-use software or implementing a hosting arrangement. Capitalization ceases no later than when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, after all substantial testing is complete.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles
: Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired in connection with our business combinations. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.

We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of this asset might exceed the current fair value. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. W
e have 
two
 reportable segments and 
two
 reporting units: Intermodal and Transportation Solutions (“ITS”) and Logistics which are based primarily on the services each segment provides. 
We assess qualitative factors such as current company performance and overall economic factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. In the quantitative goodwill test, a company compares the carrying value of its reporting units to their fair value. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized in the amount by which carrying amount exceeds fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

We performed our annual assessment in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2023 as required and determined it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of our reporting units was less than its carrying value.

40

We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets when impairment indicators exist. If the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.

Claims Accruals: 
We purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries, vehicular collisions, accidents, and cargo damage. Certain insurance arrangements include high self-insurance retention limits or deductibles applicable to each claim. We have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to large claim costs.
Our claims accrual policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by third-party claims administrators, as well as legal and regulatory factors. Our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim. The ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature, timing, and extent of damages claimed becomes available. Accordingly, we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability. This process involves the use of loss-development factors based on our historical claims experience. In doing so, the recorded liability factors in future growth of claims and an allowance for incurred-but-not-reported claims. We do not discount our estimated losses. In addition, we record receivables for amounts expected to be reimbursed for payments made in excess of self-insurance levels on covered claims related to auto liability and workers’ compensation. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had an accrual of approximately 
$
38.5
 million and 
$
39.1
 million, respectively for estimated claims. We had no significant receivables recorded for payments in excess of our self-insu
red levels. Our claims accruals are classified in accrued other and non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, based on when the claim is estimated to be paid.
Concentration of Credit Risk
: Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We place our cash and temporary investments with high quality financial institutions in DDAs, savings accounts, checking accounts and money market accounts. We primarily serve customers located throughout the United States with no significant concentration in any one region. In each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, one customer accounted for more than 
10
% of our annual revenue in both segments. We review a custo
mer’s credit history before extending credit. In addition, we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers and, as a consequence, believe that our trade accounts receivable risk is limited.
The following table includes the one customer that represented 10% or more of our annual revenue by segment during the last three fiscal years:

Revenue Recognition
: In accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” our significant accounting policy for revenue is as follows:
Revenue is recognized when we transfer services to our customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. We generally recognize revenue over time because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. Since control is transferred over time, revenue and related transportation costs are recognized based on relative transit time, which is based on the extent of progress towards completion of the related performance obligation. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of services, which are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by us from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Further, in most cases, we report our revenue on a gross basis because we are the primary obligor as we are responsible for providing the service desired by the customer. Our customers view us as responsible for fulfillment including the acceptability of the service. Service requirements may include, for example, on-time delivery, handling freight loss and damage claims, setting up appointments for pick-up and delivery and tracing shipments in transit. We have discretion in setting prices to our customers and as a result, the amount we earn varies. In addition, we have the discretion to select our vendors from multiple suppliers for the services ordered by our customers. These factors, discretion in setting prices and discretion in selecting vendors, further support reporting revenue on a gross basis for most of our revenue.
Provision for Income Taxes: 
Significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain tax-related contingencies on our provision for income taxes. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes, we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not to be sustained in our financial statements. Such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments, whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Further, years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved or its statute of limitations expires. We recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax liabilities in our provision for income taxes.

 Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial statement and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized based on future taxable income projections, with one exception. We have established a valuation allowance of 
$
2.9
 mill
ion related to certain federal and state tax credit carryforwards. In the event the probability of realizing the remaining deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not threshold in the future, a valuation allowance would be established for the deferred tax assets deemed unrecoverable.
Earnings Per Common Share
: Basic earnings per common share are based on the average quarterly weighted average number of Class A and Class B shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share are adjusted for restricted stock using the treasury stock method.

Stock Based Compensation: 
Share-based compensation includes the restricted stock awards expected to vest based on the grant date fair value. Compensation expense is amortized straight-line over the vesting period and is included in salaries and benefits
.
New Pronouncements: 
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense disaggregation disclosures (Topic 220) - Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
.  ASU 2024-03 requires additional disclosure of the nature of expenses included in the income statement in response to requests from investors for more information about an entity’s expenses. The new standard requires disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures about selling expenses.  For public business entities, ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027.  We are currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance on our disclosures; it will not have an impact on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09"). ASU 2023-09 enhanced annual disclosures regarding the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. For public business entities, ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures; it will not have an impact on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.

42

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires retrospective disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis. Additionally, it requires disclosure of the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). We adopted this new accounting standard effective for our fiscal December 31, 2024 year-end disclosures. The adoption of this standard impacted our disclosures only and did not have an impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
See Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for details related to “Segment Reporting.”

on our Class A and Class B Common Stock. The dividend was paid on September 25, 2024 to stockholders of record as of September 6, 2024. 
•
On November 25, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $
0.125
 per share

on our Class A and Class B Common Stock. The dividend was paid on December 20, 2024 to stockholders of record as of December 6, 2024. 

The declarations and payments of the quarterly cash dividends were subject to the approval of the Board at its sole discretion and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Board will declare or pay cash dividends on the shares of Common Stock in the future. Our certificate of incorporation requires that any cash dividends must be paid equally on each outstanding share of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Our credit facility prohibits us from paying dividends on the Common Stock if there has been, or immediately following the payment of a dividend there would be, a default or an event of default under the credit facility.
Stock Split: 
On January 4, 2024, we announced a two-for-one stock split of our Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was implemented in the form of a distribution of one additional share of Class A Common Stock for each share outstanding. The record date for the stock split was as of the close of business on January 16, 2024. Our distribution date of the additional shares was January 26, 2024. 
As a result of the stock split, the number of authorized shares remained unchanged
. 
Additionally, the par value per share of the common stock remains unchanged. 
All other sh
are amounts in our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, consolidated statements of stockholders' equity and related footnote disclosures have been adjusted and presented as though the stock split had occurred on January 1, 2021.

Use of Estimates
: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the allowance for uncollectible trade accounts, exposure for self-insured claims under our insurance policies, valuation of acquired goodwill and intangible assets and useful lives of assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Reclassifications:
 Due to presentation changes made in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements under “Income Taxes,” certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

NOTE 2. Capital Structure

We have authorized common stock comprised of Class A Common Stock and Cla
ss B Common Stock. The rights of holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are identical, except each share of Class B Common Stock entitles its holder to approximately 
84
 votes, while each share of Class A Common Stock entitles its holder to 
one
 vote. 
We have authorized 
2,000,000
 shares of preferred stock.

NOTE 4. Business Combinations

EASO Transaction
On 
October 23, 2024
, we entered into an investment agreement with Corporación Interamericana de Logística, S.A. de C.V. and certain associated entities (commonly known as “EASO”), a family-led, intermodal and trucking logistics provider headquartered in Mexico City to acquire a controlling interest in EASO. EASO specializes in intermodal, dedicated trucking, truckload and freight brokerage services. Through a network of terminals across Mexico, EASO serves the entire Mexican domestic market and main logistics hubs in the U.S. using its intermodal cross-border network.
The estimated fair value of total consideration transferred was approximately $
55
 million for a 
51
% equity stake in EASO. The financial res
ults of EASO, since the date of acquisition, are included in our ITS segment.

The EASO investment transaction expanded our intermodal and transportation solutions business. With a substantial increase in cross-border trade activity from nearshoring, this transaction improves our ability to provide a cross-border service offering and provides increased intermodal conversion opportunities.
The initial accounting for the EASO transaction is incomplete as we, with the support of our valuation specialist, are in the process of finalizing the fair market value calculations of the acquired net assets as well as non-controlling interests. In addition, we are in the preparation and review process of the applicable future cash flows used in determining the purchase accounting. Finally, certain post-closing activities outlined in the investment agreement remain incomplete. As a result, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements related to the EASO transaction are preliminary and the measurement period remains open.

The EASO transaction was accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with ASC 805 “Business Combinations.” In connection with the transaction, we performed a consolidation analysis concluding that we control all EASO entities through either a majority voting interest or as the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. As a result, 
100
% of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests were recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at their estimated fair values as of October 23, 2024, with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as goodwill. The goodwill recognized in the EASO transaction was primarily attributable to potential expansion and future development of the business. This goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

45

Total consideration transferred includes $
30.6
 million of deferred cash consideration, all or a portion of which may be paid at least two years after the closing date of the transaction. As a result of the restrictions on this deferred consideration in the investment agreement, we have classified the associated cash as Restricted Cash in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2024, the balances of Deferred Consideration and Restricted Cash were 
$
30.6
 million and 
$
28.7
 million, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Total consideration transferred includes $
3.7
 million of contingent consideration related to certain operating tax balances existing prior to the transaction for which we have agreed to reimburse the full amount of cash collected within two years of the closing date of the transaction. The estimated fair value of such contingent consideration is based on estimated collectability of such operating tax balances within the agreed timeframe.
Our investment in one of the EASO entities, Corporación Interamericana de Logística, S.A. de C.V. (“CIL”), qualifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). Based on the rights provided in the investment and shareholder agreements, as well as the design of the VIE, our majority exposure to the variability associated with economic performance of the VIE, and the relationship and significance of activities of the VIE to us, we determined that we are most closely associated with the VIE and are therefore considered the primary beneficiary.
During a period from 2030 to 2032, Hub will have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an amount of issued and outstanding shares of EASO such that, upon exercising this call right, we would own 
80
% of all of the issued and outstanding shares of EASO at a purchase price based on earnings multiples as defined in the shareholders agreement. We evaluated this call right and concluded that it does not meet the definition of a derivative, resulting in the non-controlling interest and embedded call right being classified as permanent equity.
We incurred approximately $
2.8
 million of transaction costs associated with the transaction in 2024 that were expensed as incurred and are reflected in general and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
The components of “Other intangibles” listed in the above table as of the transaction date are preliminarily estimated based on prior acquisitions as follows (in thousands):

Forward Air Final Mile Acquisition
On 
December 20, 2023
, we acquired 
100
% of the equity interest of Forward Air Final Mile (“FAFM”). FAFM provides residential last mile delivery services and installation of big and bulky goods, with a focus on appliances, throughout the United States. Total consideration for the transaction was $
257.2
 million. $
260.9
 million was paid in cash in December 2023 while $
3.7
 million was received from the seller in the second quarter of 2024 as part of the post-closing true-up of net working capital. The financial results of FAFM, since the date of acquisition, are included in our Logistics segment.

 The FAFM acquisition expanded our 
final mile services to include the delivery and installation of appliances. 
FAFM provides residential last mile delivery services through a non-asset business model, working with a network of over 
350
 carriers throughout the country.

Based on refined inputs incorporated into the fair market value calculations during 2024, we have estimated that the fair value of intangible assets totals $
95.1
 million as of December 31, 2024. This represents a $
39.4
 million decrease relative to the initial estimated fair value of the intangible assets and results in a corresponding increase to goodwill.

NOTE 5. Segment Reporting
Our 
CEO
 has been identified as our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). We have 
two
 reportable segments: Intermodal and Transportation Solutions (“ITS”) and Logistics which are based primarily on the services each segment provides. Our ITS segment includes our asset-light business lines: intermodal and dedicated trucking. Our Logistics segment includes our non-asset business lines: managed transportation, truck brokerage, final mile and consolidated fulfillment services. 
Our CODM uses operating income by segment to make decisions over the allocation of capital and resources and assess the performance of our segments.

Intermodal and Transportation Solutions. 
Our ITS segment offers high service, nationwide door-to-door intermodal transportation, providing value, visibility and reliability in both transcontinental and local lanes by combining rail transportation with local trucking. This segment includes our trucking operations which provides our customers with local pickup and delivery (referred to as “drayage”) as well as high service local and regional trucking transportation using equipment dedicated to their needs. We arrange for the movement of our customers’ freight in one of our approximately 
50,000
 containers. As of December 31, 2024, we operated trucking terminals at 
32
 locations throughout the United States and Mexico, with locations in many large metropolitan areas. We also contract for services with independent owner-operators who supply their own equipment and operate under our regulatory authority. These assets and contractual services are used to support drayage for our intermodal service offering and to serve our customers who require high service local and regional trucking transportation using equipment dedicated to their needs. We contract with railroads to provide transportation for the long-haul portion of the shipment between rail terminals. Drayage between origin or destination and rail terminals are provided by our own trucking operations and third parties with whom we contract. Our dedicated service operation offers fleets of equipment and drivers to each customer on a contract basis, as well as the management and infrastructure to operate according to the customer’s high service expectations. As of December 31, 2024, our trucking transportation operation consisted of approximately 
2,300
 tractors, 
3,200
 employee drivers and 
4,700
 trailers. We also contract for services with approximately 
500
 independent owner-operators.

48

Logistics
. Our Logistics segment offers a wide range of services including transportation management, freight brokerage services, shipment optimization, load consolidation, mode selection, carrier management, load planning and execution, warehousing, fulfillment, cross-docking, consolidation services and final mile delivery. These services include a full range of trucking transportation services, including dry van, expedited, less-than-truckload, refrigerated and flatbed, all of which is provided by third party carriers with whom we contract. We also leverage proprietary technology along with collaborative relationships with third party service providers to deliver cost savings and performance-enhancing supply chain services to our clients. Our transportation management offering also serves as a source of volume for our ITS segment. Many of the customers for these solutions are consumer goods companies who sell into the retail channel. Our final mile delivery offering provides residential final mile delivery and installation of appliances and big and bulky goods. Final mile operates through a network of independent service providers in company, customer and third-party facilities throughout the continental United States. Our business operates or has access to approximately 
7
 million square feet of warehousing and cross-dock space across North America, to which our customers ship their goods to be stored and distributed to destinations including residences, retail stores and other commercial locations. These services offer our customers shipment visibility, transportation cost savings, high service and compliance with retailers’ increasingly stringent supply chain requirements. Logistics also includes our brokerage business which provides third-party truckload, less-than-truckload (“LTL”), flatbed and temperature-controlled needs.

NOTE 6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Our goodwill is allocated between 
two
 reporting units, ITS and Logistics. In accordance with the FASB issued guidance in the Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Topic of the Codification, we completed the required annual impairment assessment, concluding it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of either of our reporting units was less than the respective carrying value. There were 
no
 accumulated impairment losses of goodwill at the beginning of the period.

We are subject to income taxation in the United States, numerous state jurisdictions, Mexico, Canada, and India. Because income tax return formats vary among the states, we file both unitary and separate company state income tax returns. We do not permanently reinvest our foreign earnings, all amounts are accrued and accounted for, though not material.

Our state tax net operating losses total $
0.1
 million. Some of those state losses have no expiration date while others will expire between 
December 31, 2028
, and 
December 31, 2044
. Management believes it is more likely than not that the loss carryforward deferred tax assets will be fully realized.

Our federal incentive tax credit carryforward of $
0.1
 million expires between 
December 31, 2025
 and 
December 31, 2028
. Our state incentive tax credit carryforwards of $
5.5
 million expire between 
December 31, 2025
 and 
December 31, 2027
. Management believes it is more likely than not that approximately $
1.9
 million of the incentive carryforward deferred tax assets will be realized and a valuation allowance of $
3.7
 million has been established for the remainder which are not expected to be realized.
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $
9.1
 million and $
12.9
 million, respectively. If recognized, these benefits would decrease our income tax provision by $

We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities in our provision for income taxes. In 2024, we included $
0.1

million in our provision for income taxes.
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law on August 16, 2022, and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (CHIPS Act) was signed into law on August 9, 2022. These laws implemented new tax provisions, primarily a 
15
% corporate alternative minimum tax and a nondeductible 
1
% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by publicly traded corporations.  In 2024, we paid approximately $
1.6
 million in excise taxes related to stock repurchases. The two acts also provide various tax credits, several of which are transferable or refundable, for the investment in or production of clean-energy effective January 1, 2023.

NOTE 8. Fair Value Measurement
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable materially approximated fair value as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the $
264.4
 million carrying value of our fixed-rate borrowings approximated the fair value. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Company's fixed-rate borrowings was $
1.4
 million less than the historical carrying value of $
350.7
 million. The fair value of the fixed-rate borrowings was estimated using an income approach based on current interest rates available to us for borrowings on similar terms and maturities.

We consider as cash equivalents all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our cash and temporary investments were with high quality financial institutions in demand deposit accounts, savings accounts, checking accounts and money market accounts.

As of December 31, 2024, Restricted Cash of 
$
28.7
 million includes cash held in both deposit accounts and escrow accounts that are not subject to remeasurement on a recurring basis.
Restricted investments included $
21.6
 million and $
20.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of mutual funds and other security investments which are reported at fair value. These investments relate to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan that is described in Note 14 and insurance deposits.

Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on valuation techniques which consider prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities. These valuation methods are based on either quoted market prices (Level 1) or inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2), or unobservable inputs (Level 3). Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and mutual funds and related liabilities are defined as “Level 1,” while long-term debt is defined as “Level 2” of the fair value hierarchy in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the Codification.

NOTE 10. Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements
In February 2022, we entered into a 
five-year
, $
350
 million unsecured credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to (i)
 the secured overnight financing rate (published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, “SOFR”), plus a specified margin based on the term of such borrowing, plus a specified margin based upon Hub’s total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (the "Total Net Leverage Ratio"), or (ii) the base rate (which is the highes
t of (a) the administrative agent's prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 
0.50
% or (c) the sum of 
1
% and 
one-month SOFR
) plus a specified margin based upon the Total Net Leverage Ratio.
 The specified margin for SOFR loans varies from 
100.0
 to 
175.0
 basis points per annum. The specified margin for base rate loans varies from 
0.0
 to 
75.0
 basis points per annum. Hub must also pay (1) a commitment fee ranging from 
10.0
 to 
25.0
 basis points per annum (based upon the Total Net Leverage Ratio) on the aggregate unused commitments and (2) a letter of credit fee ranging from 
100.0
 to 
175.0
 basis points per annum (based upon the Total Net Leverage Ratio) on the undrawn amount of letters of credit.

We have standby letters of credit that expire in 
2025
. Our letters of credit were $
1
 million as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
, we had 
no
 borrowings under our respective credit agreements. Our unused and available borrowings were $
349
 million as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We were in compliance with the financial covenants in our credit agreements as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

We have entered into various Equipment Notes (“Notes”) for the purchase of tractors, trailers, containers and refrigeration units. The Notes are secured by the underlying equipment financed in the agreements.

NOTE 11. Leases

In accordance with ASC 842, “Leases,” (“ASC 842”) which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a lease obligation for all leases, we made an accounting policy election to not recognize an asset and liability for leases with a term of twelve months or less.

As of December 31, 2024, we recorded $
234.7
 million of ROU assets and $
244.1
 million of lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, we recorded $
213.3
 million of ROU assets and $
224.8
 million of lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. The lease liabilities recognized are measured based upon the present value of minimum future payments. The ROU assets are equal to lease liabilities upon initial recording, adjusted for prepaid and accrued rent balances which are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We currently do not have any variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate (such as the Consumer Price Index or a market interest rate). Some leases have options to extend or terminate the agreement, which management assesses in determining the estimated lease term. If any of the options to extend a lease are exercised, this change will be reflected as a remeasurement of the ROU asset and lease liability accordingly. As of December 31, 2024, the ROU asset and lease liabilities do not reflect any options to extend or terminate a lease as management is not reasonably certain it will exercise any of these options. Also, current leases do not contain any restrictions or covenants imposed by the leases or residual value guarantees.
As of December 31, 2024, we signed new property lease contracts which had not commenced. Based on the present value of the lease payments, the estimated ROU assets and lease liabilities related to these contracts will total approximately 
$
2.8
 million.
Discount rates are not specified on the individual lease contracts at the commencement date. To determine the present value of the lease payments, we used our incremental borrowing rate which was determined based on our credit standing and factoring in the current 12-month SOFR rate published at the time of the lease commencement. This incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term and amounts equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.

NOTE 12. Internal-Use Software

We capitalize internal and external costs, which include costs related to the development of our cloud computing or hosting arrangements, incurred to develop internal use software per ASC Subtopic 350-40. Refer to Note 1 "Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for information regarding accounting policy.

We had total capitalized internal use software costs, which include costs related to the development of our cloud computing or hosting arrangements, net of accumulated amortization, of 
$
56.0
 million and 
$
56.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2024 balance consists of capitalized implementation costs of 
$
13.2

NOTE 13. Stock-Based Compensation Plans
The 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2022 Incentive Plan”) was approved by our Board of Directors and subsequently approved by our stockholders at the 2022 annual meeting. The 2022 Incentive Plan authorizes a broad range of awards including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance shares or units, other stock-based awards, and cash incentive awards to all employees (including our executive officers), directors, consultants, or independent contractors of us or a related company. The 2022 Incentive Plan is effective as of May 24, 2022.
As of December 31, 2024
, 
2,169,625
 shares were available for future grant under the 2022 Incentive Plan.
We have awarded time-based restricted stock to our employees and non-employee directors (“Outside Directors”). This restricted stock generally vests ratably (once per year) over a 
three
 to 
five-year
 period for recipients other than Outside Directors. Outside Directors’ restricted stock vests over a one-year period. In 
2024, 2023, and 2022, we also granted performance-based restricted stock to our executive officers. The performance-based restricted stock vests upon the third anniversary of its issuance if certain financial targets are achieved.
Share-based compensation expense for 2024, 2023 and 2022
 was $
19.0
 million, $
21.2
 million and $
20.6
 million or $
14.9
 million, $
17.0
 million and $
15.7
 million, net of taxes, respectively. Included in the 
2024, 2023, and 2022
 share-based compensation expense was $
5.2

million, $
6.3

 in

The total fair value of restricted shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
 was $
27.8
 million, $
26.1
 million and $
22.7
 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
, there was $
33.7
 million, $
34.0
 million and $
41.3
 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested time-based compensation, respectively, that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period for

 of
 2.66
 years, 
2.75
 years and 
2.67

258,574
 time-based shares, to certain employees and 
36,224

five-year
 period for employees and a 
one-year
 period for Outside Directors. Performance-based grants vest after 
three years
.

NOTE 14. Employee Benefit Plans

We have a profit-sharing plan under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. At our discretion, we partially match qualified contributions made by employees to the plan. We incurred expense related to the employer match for this plan of $
7.7
 million in 
2024
, $
8.5
 million in 
2023
 and $
6.7
 million in 
2022.

In January 2005, we established the Hub Group, Inc. Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) to provide added incentive for the retention of certain key employees. Under the Plan, which was amended in 2008, participants can elect to defer certain compensation. Accounts grow on a tax-deferred basis to the participant. Restricted investments included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets represent the fair value of the mutual funds and other security investments related to the Plan as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in inco
me and expense and offset the change in the deferred compensation liability. We provide a 
50
% match on the first 6% of employee compensation deferred under the Plan which vests over three years with a maximum match equivalent to 
3
% of base salary. We incurred expenses of $
0.2
 million in 
2024
 and $
0.3
 million in both 
2023 and 2022 related to the employer match for this plan. The assets related to the Plan as of December 31, 2024 and 2023
 totaled $
21.4
 million and $
20.5
 million, respectively. The liabilities related to the Plan as of December 31, 
2024 and 2023
 totaled $
21.4
 million and $
20.5
 million, respectively.

NOTE 15. Legal Matters
We are involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business, including putative class-action lawsuits involving employment related claims. Based on management's present knowledge, management does not believe that any potential unrecorded loss contingencies arising from these pending matters are likely to have a material adverse effect on our overall financial position, operating results, or cash flows after taking into account any existing accruals for settlements or losses determined to be probable and estimable. However, actual outcomes could be material to our financial position, operating results or cash flows for any particular period.

NOTE 16. Stock Repurchase Plans

In October 2023, the Board authorized the purchase of up to $
250
 million of our Class A Common Stock pursuant to a share repurchase program (the 
“
2023 Program
”
), which replaces the 2022 Program. Under the 2023 Program, the shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, from time to time subject to market and other conditions. The approved share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares and the program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.
We purchased 
1,830,275
 shares for 
$
79.0
 million during 2024
, 
4,020,598
 shares for $
153.9
 million during 
2023
 and 
2,957,330
 shares for $
118.1
 million in 
2022. 
These amounts include the number of shares delivered to us by employees to satisfy the mandatory tax withholding requirement upon vesting of restricted stock, which do not reduce the repurchase authority under our share repurchase program.

NOTE 17. Related Party Transactions
In August 2022, we entered into a Common Stock Exchange and Repurchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with entities affiliated with David P. Yeager, then our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer (collectively, the “DPY Entities”) and entities affiliated with Mark A. Yeager, the brother of David P. Yeager (collectively, the “MAY Entities”).
Pursuant to the Agreement, the MAY Entities transferred 
243,755
 shares of Class B Common Stock, $
0.01
 par value per share, to the DPY Entities in exchange for 
685,456
 shares of Class A Common Stock, $
0.01
 par value per share (the “Class A Exchange Shares”; such transfer in exchange for the Class A Exchange Shares is referred to herein as the “Exchange”). Immediately after the consummation of the Exchange, the MAY Entities sold to us (i) all of the Class A Exchange Shares and (ii) 
87,393
 shares of Class B Common Stock (the “Remaining Class B Shares”), representing all of the remaining shares of Class B Common Stock owned by the MAY Entities, for an aggregate purchase price of $
34.8
 million (the “Repurchase” and, together with the “Exchange,” the “Transaction”). The purchase price for the Repurchase was based on a price per share equal to the closing price of Class A Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of the Agreement. In accordance with our Certificate of Incorporation, the Remaining Class B Shares acquired by us were cancelled and converted into Class A Common Stock upon acquisition and are not available for reissuance.

The Transaction was approved by our Audit Committee of the Board pursuant to our Related Person Transaction Policy approval procedures.

ONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of December 31, 2024, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.

No significant changes were made in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate controls over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria), management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

On October 23, 2024, we entered into an investment agreement with Corporación Interamericana de Logística, S.A. de C.V. and certain associated entities (commonly known as “EASO”) to acquire a controlling interest in EASO. We are currently integrating processes, employees, technologies and operations. As permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), we excluded EASO from our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management will continue to evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting as we complete our integration. As of December 31, 2024, EASO represented 5.3% of total assets and 5.7% of net assets. For the year ended December 31, 2024, EASO represented 0.5% of revenues and 0.1% of net income.

Management believes, however, that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements, included in this report, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Hub Group, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Hub Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Hub Group, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

As indicated in the accompanying Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of 
Corporación Interamericana de Logística, S.A. de C.V. and certain associated entities (commonly known as “EASO”), 
which were acquired on October 23, 2024 and is included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 5.3% and 5.7%

of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2024 and 0.5% and 0.1% of revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of EASO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(b), and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
