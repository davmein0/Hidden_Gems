Item 2.	PROPERTIES

As of December 31, 2024, we directly, or indirectly through our subsidiaries, operated 101 offices, terminals and warehouses throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico, including our headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois. All of our facilities are leased except for our headquarters. Most office, terminal and warehouse leases have initial terms of more than one year and many include options to renew. While some of our leases expire in the near term, we do not believe that we will have difficulty in renewing them or in finding alternative office, warehouse or terminal space. We believe that our offices, warehouses and terminals are adequate for the purposes for which they are currently used.
