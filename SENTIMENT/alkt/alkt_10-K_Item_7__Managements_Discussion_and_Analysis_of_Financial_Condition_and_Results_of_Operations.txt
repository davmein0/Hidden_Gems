Overview
Alkami is a cloud-based digital banking solutions provider. We inspire and empower community, regional and super-regional financial institutions (“FIs”) to compete with large, technologically advanced and well-resourced banks in the United States. Our solution, the Alkami Digital Banking Platform, allows FIs to onboard and engage new users, accelerate revenues and meaningfully improve operational efficiency, all with the support of a proprietary, true cloud-based, multi-tenant architecture. We cultivate deep relationships with our clients through long-term, subscription-based contractual arrangements, aligning our growth with our clients’ success and generating an attractive unit economic model.
Alkami was founded to help level the playing field for FIs. Since then, our vision has been to create a platform that combines premium technology and fintech solutions in one integrated ecosystem, delivered as a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solution and providing our clients’ customers with a single point of access to all things digital. We have invested significant resources to build a technology stack that prioritized innovation velocity and speed-to-market given the importance of product depth and functionality in winning and retaining clients. In October 2020, we acquired ACH Alert, LLC (“ACH Alert”) to pursue adjacent product opportunities, such as fraud prevention and to expand our addressable market. In September 2021, we acquired MK Decisioning Systems, LLC (“MK”), a technology platform for digital account opening, credit card and loan origination solutions. In April 2022, we acquired Segmint, Inc. (“Segmint”), a leading cloud-based financial data analytics and transaction data cleansing provider.
During 2024, we established a new subsidiary in India to support potential future operational needs. As of December 31, 2024, this entity had immaterial operations and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results. We will continue to assess the impact of this entity as operations evolve.
Our domain expertise in retail and business banking has enabled us to develop a suite of products tailored to address key challenges faced by FIs. Due to our architecture, adding products through our single code base is fast, simple and cost-effective. The key differentiators of the Alkami Digital Banking Platform include:
•
User experience
: Personalized and seamless digital experience across user interaction points, including desktop, mobile, chat and SMS, establishing durable connections between FIs and their customers.
•
Integrations
: Scalability and extensibility driven by more than 300 real-time integrations to back-office systems and third-party fintech solutions as of December 31, 2024, including core systems, payment cards, mortgages, bill pay, electronic documents, money movement, personal financial management and account opening.
•
Deep data capabilities
: Data synchronized and stored from back-office systems and third-party fintech solutions and synthesized into meaningful insights, targeted content, and other areas of monetization.
The Alkami Digital Banking Platform offers an end-to-end set of digital banking products. Our typical relationship with an FI begins with a set of core functional components, which can extend over time to include a rounded suite of products across account opening, marketing, data insights, card experience, money movement, customer service, business banking, financial wellness, security and fraud protection and extensibility.
We primarily go to market through an internal sales force. Given the long-term nature of our Alkami Digital Banking Platform contracts, a typical sales cycle can range from approximately three to 12 months, with the subsequent implementation timeframe generally ranging from six to 12 months depending on the depth of integration.
We derive our Alkami Digital Banking Platform revenues almost entirely from multi-year contracts that are based on an average contract life of approximately 70 months as of December 31, 2024. We predominantly employ a per-registered-user pricing model, with incremental fees above certain contractual client minimum commitments for each licensed solution. In these cases, our pricing is tiered, with per-registered-user discounts applied as clients achieve higher levels of customer penetration, incentivizing our clients to internally market and promote digital engagement.
To support our growth and capitalize on our market opportunity, we have increased our operating expenses across all aspects of our business. In research and development, we continue to focus on innovation and bringing novel capabilities to our platform, extending our product depth. Similarly, we continue to expand our sales and marketing organization focusing on new client wins, cross-selling opportunities and client

renewals.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, our total revenues were $333.8 million, $264.8 million, and $204.3 million, respectively, representing a growth rate of 26.1% from 2023 to 2024 and 29.6% from 2022 to 2023. SaaS subscription revenues, as further described below, represented 95.6%, 95.3%, and 95.2% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. We incurred net losses of $40.8 million, $62.9 million, and $58.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, largely due to significant continued investment in sales, marketing, product development and post-sales client activities.

See Note 17 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Factors Affecting our Operating Results
Growing our FI Client Base.  
A key part of our strategy is to grow our FI client base. As of December 31, 2024, we served 272 FIs through the Alkami Digital Banking Platform and over 750 clients when including unique clients only subscribing to one or a combination of ACH Alert, MK or Segmint products. Each of our digital banking client wins is a competitive takeaway, and as such, our historical ability to grow our client base has been a function of product depth, technological excellence and a sales and marketing function able to match our solutions with the strategic objectives of our clients. Our future success will significantly depend on our ability to continue to grow our FI client base through competitive wins.
Deepening Client Customer Penetration.  
We primarily generate revenues through a per-registered-user pricing model. Once we onboard a client, our ability to help drive incremental client customer digital adoption translates to additional revenues with very limited additional spend. Our FI clients are incentivized to market and encourage digital account sign-up based on identifiable improvement in customer engagement, as well as discounts received based on certain levels of customer penetration. We expect to continue to support digital adoption by client customers through continued investments in new products and platform enhancements. Our future success will depend on our ability to continue to deepen client customer penetration.
Expanding our Product Suite.  
Product depth is a key determinant in winning new clients. In a replacement market, we win based on our ability to bring a product suite to market that is superior to the incumbent, as well as to our broader competition. Of equal importance is the ability to cohesively deliver a deep product suite with as little friction as possible to the client customer. The depth of our product suite is a function of technology and platform partnerships. Our platform model with more than 300 integrations as of December 31, 2024 enables us to deliver thousands of configurations aligned with the digital platform strategies adopted by our clients. We expect our future success in winning new clients to be partially driven by our ability to continue to develop and deliver new, innovative products to FI clients in a timely manner. Furthermore, expanding our product suite expands our Revenue per Registered User (“RPU”) potential. For additional information regarding RPU, see “Key Business Metrics.”
Client Renewals.  
Our model and the stability of our revenue base is, in part, driven by our ability to renew our clients. In addition to extending existing relationships, renewals provide an opportunity to grow minimum contract value, as over the course of a contract term our clients often grow, or their needs evolve. Client renewals are also an important lever in driving our long-term gross margin targets, as we generally achieve 
36    
Table of Contents
approximately 70% gross margin upon renewal. We had 42 client renewals in the year ended December 31, 2024. We expect client renewals to continue to play a key role in our future success. 
Continued Leadership in Innovation.  
Our ability to maintain a differentiated platform and offering is dependent upon our pace of innovation. Our single code base, built on a multi-tenant infrastructure and combined with continuous software delivery enables us to bring new, innovative products to market quickly and positions us with what we believe is market-leading breadth in terms of product offerings and feature sets. We remain committed to investing in our platform, notably through our research and development spend, which was 28.8% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our future success will depend on our continued leadership in innovation.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenues
Our client relationships are predominantly based on multi-year contracts for the Alkami Digital Banking Platform that have had an average contract life of approximately 70 months as of December 31, 2024. We derive the majority of our revenues from SaaS subscription services charged for the use of our digital banking solution. Subscription services are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the client agreement term beginning on the date our solution is made available to our client. The promised consideration may include fixed or variable amounts. Our clients with enterprise license contracts are invoiced on an agreed upon monthly rate throughout the contract term, which may include fixed monthly or annual rate escalations. Fixed dollar or percentage escalations that are not based on registered users are considered part of the fixed transaction price and recognized on a straight-line basis over the SaaS subscription period evenly. The majority of our client contracts are based on registered users, which we invoice monthly a contractual minimum fee for each licensed solution. In addition, we invoice monthly an additional subscription fee for the number of registered users using each solution and the number of bill-pay and certain other transactions those registered users conduct through our digital banking platform in excess of their contractual client minimum commitments. Our pricing is tiered, with per-registered-user discounts applied as clients achieve higher levels of customer penetration, incentivizing our clients to internally market our products and promote digital engagement. Variable consideration earned for subscription fees in excess of contractual minimums is recognized as revenues in the month of actual usage. SaaS subscription services also include annual and monthly charges for maintenance and support services, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term.
We receive implementation and other upfront fees for the implementation, configuration and integration of our digital banking platform. We typically invoice these services as a fixed price per contract. These fees are not distinct from the underlying licensed SaaS subscription services. As a result, we recognize the resulting revenues on a straight-line basis over the client’s initial agreement term for our licensed SaaS solutions, commencing upon launch.
Occasionally, our clients request custom development and other professional services, which we provide. These are generally one-time requests and involve unique, non-standard features, functions, conversions, or integrations that are intended to enhance or modify their licensed SaaS solutions. We recognize revenues at the point in time the services are transferred to the client.
The following disaggregates our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 by major source:

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin
Cost of revenues is comprised primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel and related costs for employees supporting our SaaS subscription, implementation and other services. This includes the costs of our implementation, client support and development personnel responsible for maintaining and releasing updates to our platform, as well as third-party cloud-based hosting services. Cost of revenues also includes the direct costs of bill-pay services and other third-party intellectual property included in our solutions, depreciation, and the amortization of acquired technology.
We capitalize certain personnel costs directly related to the implementation of our solutions to the extent those costs are recoverable from future revenues. We amortize the costs for an implementation once revenue recognition commences. The amortization period is typically five to seven years, which represents the expected period of client benefit. Other costs not directly recoverable from future revenues are expensed in the period incurred.
We intend to continue to increase our investments in our implementation, client support teams and technology infrastructure to serve our clients and support our growth. We expect cost of revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars as we grow our business, but to vary as a percentage of revenues from period to period as a function of the utilization of implementation and support personnel and the extent to which we

recognize fees from bill-pay services and other third-party functionality integrated into our solutions. Our gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was 58.9%, 54.4%, and 53.0%, respectively.

Operating Expenses
Research and Development.   
Research and development costs consist primarily of personnel-related costs for our engineering, information technology and product employees, including salaries, bonuses, other incentive-related compensation, employee benefits and stock-based compensation. In addition, we also include third-party contractor expenses, software development and testing tools, allocated corporate expenses and other expenses related to developing new solutions and upgrading and enhancing existing solutions. We expect research and development costs to increase as we expand our platform with new features and functionality, as well as enhance the existing Alkami Digital Banking Platform.
Sales and Marketing.   
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs of our sales, marketing and our client success employees, including salaries, bonuses, commissions, other incentive-related compensation, employee benefits and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include travel and related costs, outside consulting fees and marketing programs, including lead generation, costs of our annual client conference, advertising, trade shows and other event expenses. We expect sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we expand our direct sales teams to pursue our market opportunity.
General and Administrative
.   
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, information technology, security and compliance and other administrative employees, including salaries, bonuses, commissions, other incentive-related compensation, employee benefits and stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses also include accounting, auditing and legal professional services fees, secondary offering costs, travel and other unallocated corporate-related expenses, such as the cost of our facilities, employee relations, corporate telecommunication and software. We expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we scale our business and as we incur costs associated with being a publicly traded company, including legal, audit, business insurance and consulting fees.
Acquisition-Related Expenses, net. 
Acquisition-related expenses, net, include acquisition-related expenses primarily related to accrual of deferred compensation, legal, consulting and professional fees. In addition, these expenses are inclusive of any gain or loss on revaluation of contingent consideration. 
Amortization of Acquired Intangibles. 
Amortization of acquired intangibles represents the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Non-operating Income (Expense)
Non-operating income (expense) consists primarily of interest income from our cash balances, interest expense from borrowings under our revolving line of credit, amortization of deferred debt costs, unrealized gains or losses on marketable securities and realized gains on sales of marketable securities.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and state tax expense. As a result of our valuation allowance, provision for income taxes consists primarily of state income taxes and deferred taxes related to the tax amortization of acquired goodwill.
Results of Operations
The results of operations presented below should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this filing.

Key Business Metrics
Adjusted EBITDA. 

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered an alternative to GAAP net loss as a measure of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity. We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before provision (benefit) for income taxes; (gain) loss on financial instruments; interest (income) expense, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; secondary offering costs; acquisition-related expenses, net; and loss on extinguishment of debt. We believe adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other users of our financial information consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations. 
Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR).

   We calculate ARR by aggregating annualized recurring revenue related to SaaS subscription services recognized in the last month of the reporting period, as well as the next 12 months of expected implementation services revenues in the last month of the reporting period. We believe ARR provides important information about our future revenue potential, our ability to acquire new clients, and our ability to maintain and expand our relationship with existing clients. 
Registered Users.

  We define a registered user as an individual or business related to an account holder of an FI client on our digital banking platform who has registered to use one or more of our solutions and has current access to use those solutions as of the last day of the reporting period presented. We price our digital banking platform based on the number of registered users, so as the number of registered users of our digital banking platform increases, our ARR grows. We believe growth in the number of registered users provides important information about our ability to expand market adoption of our digital banking platform and its associated software products, and therefore to grow revenues over time.
Revenue per Registered User (RPU).
    We calculate RPU by dividing ARR as of the last day of the reporting period by the number of registered users as of the last day of the reporting period. We believe RPU provides important information about our ability to grow the number of software products adopted by new clients over time, as well as our ability to expand the number of software products that our existing clients add to their contracts with us over time.

Revenues increased $69.0 million, or 26.1%, for 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in revenues was primarily due to registered user growth of 2.5 million, comprised of 1.3 million in registered user growth from existing clients and 1.2 million in registered users from new clients implemented through our digital banking platform (contractual minimums). In addition, increased revenues were due to RPU growth of 7.1%. RPU growth was primarily driven by cross-sell activity to existing clients and higher average RPU of new clients implemented on our digital banking platform compared to aggregate RPU. The average RPU of users from new clients implemented on our digital platform in the last year of $21.70 is 21.8% higher than the aggregate RPU as of December 31, 2024.

The increase in cost of revenues was primarily driven by $14.6 million in higher costs of our third-party partners where we resell their solutions as part of the digital platform, and a $0.6 million increase in personnel-related costs (which includes a decrease in stock-based compensation of $0.2 million) resulting from headcount increases supporting our growth in the following teams: client implementation, site reliability engineering and client support, as well as higher miscellaneous other costs of $1.7 million. These expenses were partially offset by a decrease in hosting costs of $0.4 million.

Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased $11.6 million, or 13.6%, for 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $5.8 million increase in personnel-related costs (which includes stock-based compensation of $1.3 million) resulting primarily from headcount growth, $5.4 million in higher consulting costs, $1.1 million in higher hosting costs, and higher miscellaneous other costs of $0.7 million. These expenses were partially offset by an increase of $1.4 million in capitalized development costs.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses increased $11.2 million, or 23.1%, for 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to an $8.6 million increase in personnel-related costs (which includes stock-based compensation of $1.8 million) resulting primarily from headcount growth in our sales and marketing teams. In addition, we incurred $1.7 million in higher consulting costs, and $1.0 million in higher travel costs for our sales team. These expenses are partially offset by lower miscellaneous other costs of $0.1 million. 
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses increased $10.8 million, or 14.7%, for 2024

compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $6.5 million increase in personnel-costs (which includes stock-based compensation of $5.3 million) resulting primarily from headcount growth, higher audit and consulting fees of $2.4 million, higher software costs of $1.7 million, and $1.3 million of secondary offering costs. These expenses are partially offset by $1.1 million lower miscellaneous other costs.
Acquisition-Related Expenses, Net
Acquisition-related expenses, net was $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Amortization of Acquired Intangibles 
Amortization of acquired intangibles was $1.4 million for both of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
Non-Operating Income (Expense)
Non-operating income increased $3.3 million

for 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $3.4 million increase in net interest income and a reduction in loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.4 million, partially offset by a $0.5 million reduction in gain on financial instruments related to marketable securities.
Provision for Income Taxes
The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.3 million and less than $0.1 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of (0.8)% and (0.1)% for 2024 and 2023, respectively.
As a result of our valuation allowance, provision for income taxes consists primarily of current state income taxes and deferred taxes related to the tax amortization of acquired goodwill. 
The difference in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023 is primarily the result of increased current state tax expense in 2024 as compared to 2023.
Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of the valuation allowance against the Company’s deferred tax assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, we had $115.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and an accumulated deficit of $476.2 million. Our net losses have been driven by our investments in developing our digital banking platform, expanding our sales, marketing and implementation organizations, and scaling our administrative functions to support our rapid growth.
We have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from the sale of SaaS subscription services. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including revenue growth and costs incurred to support client usage and growth in our client base, increased research and development expenses to support the growth of our business and related infrastructure, increased general and administrative expenses associated with being a publicly traded company, investments in office facilities and other capital expenditure requirements and any potential future acquisitions or other strategic transactions.
We believe that our existing cash resources, including our Amended Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy, planned capital expenditures and the additional expenses we expect to incur as a public company for the short term (at least the next 12 months) and longer term (beyond the next 12 months). We may, from time to time, seek to raise additional capital to support our growth. Any equity financing we may undertake could be dilutive to our existing stockholders, and any additional debt financing we may undertake could require debt service and financial and operational requirements that could adversely affect our business.

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $11.8 million, which was primarily due to proceeds of $20.2 million from stock option exercises to purchase 2.6 million shares of common stock and proceeds from issuances under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) of $4.7 million, partially offset by payments for taxes related to net settlement of equity awards of $12.8 million and debt issuance costs of $0.4 million.

Table of Contents
For the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in financing activities was $87.8 million, which was primarily due to $85.0 million of principal payments on term debt, payments for taxes related to net settlement of equity awards of $16.0 million, payment of an acquisition related holdback of $3.6 million and debt issuance costs paid of $0.3 million, partially offset by proceeds of $13.0 million from the exercise of stock options to purchase 2.2 million shares of our common stock and proceeds from issuances under the ESPP of $4.1 million.
Amended Credit Agreement
On July 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the Company’s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of April 29, 2022 (as amended, the “Amended Credit Agreement”), with Silicon Valley Bank, a division of First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company, as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto. The Second Amendment, among other things, (i) extended the maturity date of the revolving commitment (“Revolving Facility”) from April 29, 2026 to April 29, 2027, (ii) increased the amount of the Revolving Facility commitment by $65.0 million, for a total Revolving Facility of $125.0 million, (iii) increased the accordion feature from $50.0 million to $100.0 million, (iv) modified certain existing covenants, including increasing the minimum trailing four quarters free cash flow requirement to $(25.0) million, and (v) for any fiscal quarter ending after the financial covenant trigger date (which was extended to April 28, 2026 or such earlier date as designated by the Company) (the “Financial Covenant Trigger Date”), replaced compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio with compliance with a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0x. Revolving Facility loans under the Amended Credit Agreement may be voluntarily prepaid and re-borrowed. The Amended Credit Agreement previously provided for a term loan, which was fully repaid in December 2023 and cannot be re-borrowed. The Company has no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2024 related to the Amended Credit Agreement. 
Obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company’s subsidiaries and secured by all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to an Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement. The Company has a standby letter of credit in the amount of $0.3 million, which serves as security under the lease relating to the Company’s office space that expires in 2033.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Before the Financial Covenant Trigger Date, the following covenants are applicable: (i) an annual recurring revenue growth covenant requiring the loan parties to have recurring revenues in any four consecutive fiscal quarter period in an amount that is 10% greater than the recurring revenues for the corresponding four consecutive quarter period in the previous year; and (ii) a liquidity (defined as the aggregate amount of cash in bank accounts subject to a control agreement plus availability under the Revolving Facility) covenant, requiring the loan parties to have liquidity, tested on the last day of each calendar month, of $20.0 million or more. After the Financial Covenant Trigger Date, the existing annual recurring revenue growth and liquidity financial covenants are no longer applicable, and the following covenants take effect: (i) a consolidated total leverage ratio requiring the ratio, as calculated at the last day of such fiscal quarter for the period of 12 consecutive months then ending, to be less than 3.50:1.00; and (ii) a consolidated interest coverage ratio requiring the ratio, for any fiscal quarter ending as calculated at the last day of such fiscal quarter for the period of 12 consecutive months then ending, to be more than 3.00:1.00.
The Second Amendment revised the free cash flow covenant, as calculated at the last day of each fiscal quarter for the period of 12 consecutive months then ending, requiring free cash flow to be not less than $(25.0) million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 and each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. 
The Amended Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, which if they occur, could result in the termination of commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement, the declaration that all outstanding loans are immediately due and payable in whole or in part, and the requirement to maintain cash collateral deposits in respect of outstanding letters of credit. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2024.
Total interest expense, including commitment fees and unused line fees, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $0.5 million, $7.4 million and $3.9 million, respectively. In conjunction with closing the Amended Credit Agreement in 2022, First Amendment in 2023, and Second Amendment in 2024, we incurred issuance costs of $0.9 million, $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, which were deferred and were scheduled to be amortized over the remaining term of the agreement. Unamortized debt issuance costs totaled $0.5 million, $0.3 million, and $0.7 million as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively. Amortization expense totaled $0.2 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.  
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the periods presented, we did not have, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and meet its short-term and long-term obligations. The Company's material future obligations include the contractual and purchase commitments described below.
We have material future purchase commitments for services which are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including price and/or quantity. Total future commitments for these obligations over the next five years is $95.2 million. Of this amount, $38.4 million is due within the next 12 months. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. 
Additionally, we have operating leases for real estate and equipment that include future minimum payments with initial terms of one year or more. Total future operating lease payments at December 31, 2024 are $25.7 million. Within the next 12 months, operating lease payments are

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances, historical experience, and actuarial valuations. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared.
Our most significant accounting policies, including Revenue Recognition and Business Combinations, are described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, or estimates. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (ii) different estimates reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations. Our most critical accounting estimates include the following:
Revenue Recognition
We derive the majority of our revenues from SaaS subscription services charged for the use of our digital banking solutions. SaaS subscription services are generally recognized as revenues over the term of the contract as a series of distinct SaaS services bundled into a single performance obligation. Clients are typically charged a one-time, upfront implementation fee and recurring annual and monthly access fees for the use of our digital banking solution. Implementation and integration of the digital banking platform is complex, and we have determined that the one-time, upfront services are not distinct. In determining whether implementation services are distinct from subscription services, we considered various factors including the significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the implementation and subscription service, as well as the inability of the clients’ personnel or other service providers to perform significant portions of the services. As a result, we defer any arrangement fees for implementation services and recognize such amounts over time on a ratable basis as one performance obligation with the underlying subscription revenue commencing when the client goes live on the platform, which corresponds with the date the client obtains access to our digital banking solution and begins to benefit from the service.
Our performance obligation for the SaaS series of services includes standing ready over the term of the contract to provide access to all the clients’ customers and process any transactions initiated by those customers. We invoice clients each month for the contracted minimum number of registered users with an additional amount for registered users in excess of those minimums. We recognize variable consideration related to registered user counts in excess of the contractual minimum amounts each month. SaaS subscription revenues also include annual and monthly charges for maintenance and support services, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the subscription term.
During the term of the contract, clients may purchase additional professional services to modify or enhance their licensed SaaS solutions. These services are distinct performance obligations recognized when control of the enhancement is transferred to the client.
Business Combinations
Our acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of business combinations accounting. We recognize the consideration transferred (i.e., purchase price) in a business combination as well as the acquired business’ identifiable assets, liabilities, and any non-controlling interests at their acquisition date fair value. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities, and non-controlling interest, is recorded as goodwill in our consolidated financial statements. Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We use our best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly and record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill; provided that we are within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.
For acquisitions involving additional consideration to be transferred to the selling parties in the event certain future events occur or conditions are met (“contingent consideration”), we recognize the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the business combination. Contingent consideration meeting the criteria to be classified as equity in the consolidated balance sheets is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is recorded within stockholders’ equity (deficit). Contingent consideration classified as a liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved, with any changes in fair value recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates.
Interest Rate Risk
We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our Amended Credit Agreement. Interest rate changes generally impact the amount of our interest payments and, therefore, our future net income and cash flows, assuming other factors held constant. Assuming the amounts outstanding under our Amended Credit Agreement are fully drawn, a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of interest-bearing accounts. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. To minimize interest rate risk in the future, we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of investment-grade securities, which may include commercial paper, money market funds and government and non-government debt securities. Because of the short-term maturities of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any significant negative impact on the realized value of our investments.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alkami Technology, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alkami Technology, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Description of the Matter
Accounting for Revenue Recognition
As disclosed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company provides subscription-based services to its customers through software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) arrangements. The timing and amount of revenue recognized is dependent on multiple factors, including the product offering, user count, price, and implementation date.
Auditing the accounting for revenue recognition was complex due to the multiple manual inputs involved in the Company’s revenue recognition calculation. For example, the Company inputs user count information from both internal and third-party sources into its revenue recognition calculation
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
To test the Company’s accounting for revenue recognition, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of inputs to the revenue recognition calculation. For example, we agreed pricing information to customer contracts and validated the implementation date through external confirmations with the Company’s customers.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alkami Technology, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Alkami Technology, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alkami Technology, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except per share data)
Note 1.  
Organization
Description of Business
Alkami Technology, Inc. (the “Company”) is a cloud-based digital banking solutions provider. The Company inspires and empowers community, regional and super-regional financial institutions (“FIs”) to compete with large, technologically advanced and well-resourced banks in the United States. The Company’s solution, the Alkami Digital Banking Platform, allows FIs to onboard and engage new users, accelerate revenues and meaningfully improve operational efficiency, all with the support of a proprietary, true cloud-based, multi-tenant architecture. The Company cultivates deep relationships with its clients through long-term, subscription-based contractual arrangements, aligning its growth with its clients’ success and generating an attractive unit economic model. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in August 2011, and its principal offices are located in Plano, Texas.
Note 2.  
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accompanying financial statements reflect the application of significant accounting policies as described below.
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). References to U.S. GAAP issued by the FASB in these notes are to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). The consolidated financial statements include accounts of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.
The Company has no sources of other comprehensive income, and accordingly, net loss presented each period is the same as comprehensive loss.
The Company has reclassified certain amounts in its notes to the consolidated financial statements in the prior periods to conform to current periods presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates and assumptions include determining the timing and amount of revenue recognition, recoverability and amortization period related to costs to obtain and fulfill contracts, deferred costs, revaluation of contingent consideration, and business combinations.
Operating Segment
The Company operates as a single operating segment and is a single-reportable segment entity. The Company provides services to customers primarily under software-as-a-service arrangements. The Company derives revenue from customers located in the United States, and the CODM manages the business activities on a consolidated basis (see Note 4 for additional information regarding revenues). The measure of the Company’s single operating segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total assets.
The Company's chief operating decision maker, or CODM, is the Chief Executive Officer. The financial information reviewed by the  CODM is presented on a consolidated basis for the single operating segment for purposes of allocating resources, evaluating financial performance and monitoring budget versus actual results based on net loss that is also reported on the consolidated statements of operations as net loss. The significant expenses within net loss on which the CODM relies include those that are reported on the consolidated statements of operations. The measure of the Company's single operating segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total assets. Substantially all of the Company's principal operations, assets and decision-making functions are located in the United States.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity’s pricing based upon their own market assumptions. The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:
The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
Level 1.
 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
53    
Table of Contents
Level 2.
 Significant other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level 3.
 Significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.
The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The carrying values of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Cash equivalents include amounts held in money market accounts that are measured at fair value using observable market prices. Marketable securities include debt securities that are measured at fair value using observable inputs.
See Note 10 for additional information regarding fair value measurements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Certain cash equivalents held in marketable securities accounts may have related unrealized gains or losses that are recognized on the consolidated statements of operations.
See Note 10 for additional information regarding cash equivalent money market and marketable securities accounts.
Marketable Securities
The Company classifies its fixed income marketable securities as trading securities based on its intentions regarding these instruments. Accordingly, marketable securities are reported at fair value, with all realized gains and losses from sales of marketable securities and unrealized holding gains and losses reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.

Accounts Receivable 
Accounts receivable represents the trade receivables billed to clients and includes unbilled amounts earned and recognized as revenues prior to period end. The accounts receivable allowance reflects a reserve that reduces the Company’s client accounts receivable to the net amount estimated to be collectible. The valuation of accounts receivable is based upon the credit-worthiness of clients, historical collection experience, an estimate of future collectability, and current events. Management also analyzes historical trends of credits issued to clients and specific invoices to estimate an allowance for disputed invoices and billing errors.
The Company assesses the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and maintains an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable deemed uncollectible. The Company analyzes the accounts receivable portfolio for significant risks and considers prior periods and forecasts future collectability to determine the amount of revenues that will ultimately be collected from its customers. Identified risks pertaining to the Company’s accounts receivable include the delinquency level and customer type. Future collectability is contingent upon current and anticipated macroeconomic conditions that could impact the Company’s customers such as unemployment, inflation and regulation matters. Historically, the Company's collection experience has not varied significantly, and credit loss expenses have been insignificant.
The Company maintains reserves for estimated sales credits issued to customers for billing disputes or other service-related reasons. These allowances are recorded as a reduction against current period revenues and accounts receivable. In estimating this allowance, the Company analyzes prior periods to determine the amounts of sales credits issued to customers compared to the revenues in the period that related to the original customer invoice. This estimate is analyzed quarterly and adjusted as necessary. The Company also maintains specific reserves for anticipated contract concessions. Refer to Note 5 for additional information.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures that increase the value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the asset’s carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.
Capitalized Software Development Costs
Software development costs relate primarily to software coding, systems interfaces, and testing of the Company’s proprietary systems and are accounted for in accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal Use Software. Internal software development costs are capitalized from the time the internal use software is in the application development stage until the software is ready for use. Business analysis, system evaluation, and software maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The capitalized software development costs are reported in property and equipment, net, in the consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally, 
five years
 from when the asset is placed in service.
54    
Table of Contents
Development Costs in a Cloud Computing Arrangement
The Company capitalizes qualified development costs incurred when modifying certain internal use systems held through hosting arrangements. This is done in accordance with the requirements for capitalizing costs incurred to develop internal-use software. In accordance with current accounting guidance, these capitalized development costs are recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets and are amortized to software license expense over the remaining fixed, non-cancellable term of the associated hosting arrangement on a straight-line basis beginning on the in-service date.
Leases
The Company determines if a contract contains a lease for accounting purposes at the inception of the arrangement. The Company is primarily a lessee with a lease portfolio comprised mainly of real estate and equipment leases. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no finance leases.
The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient which allows the Company to account for lease and non-lease components of a contract as a single leasing arrangement for the real estate asset class. Additionally, the Company elected the short-term lease exemption, whereby leases with initial terms of one year or less are not capitalized and instead expensed generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Operating lease assets are included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets in non-current assets as a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset, and represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Operating lease liabilities are included on the Company's consolidated balance sheets in lease liabilities, current portion, for the portion that is due within 12 months and in lease liabilities, net of current portion, for the portion that is due beyond 12 months of the financial statement date and represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments.
ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term using an appropriate discount rate. If an implicit rate is not readily determined by the Company's leases, the Company utilizes the incremental borrowing rate based on the available information at the commencement date to determine the lease payments. The depreciable lives of the underlying leased assets are generally limited to the expected lease term inclusive of any optional lease renewals where the Company concludes at the inception of the lease that the Company is reasonably certain of exercising those options. The ROU asset calculation may also include any initial direct costs paid and is reduced by any lease incentives provided by the lessor. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
After the lease commencement date, the Company evaluates lease modifications, if any, that could result in a change in the accounting for leases. For a lease modification, an evaluation is performed to determine if it should be treated as either a separate lease or a change in the accounting of an existing lease. If determined to be a change in the accounting for an existing lease, the Company will remeasure the ROU asset and lease liability as of the modification date. If a lease modification includes a partial termination, the difference between any reduction in the ROU asset and lease liability is recorded to the consolidated statements of operations within general and administrative expenses.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment would be recognized if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets. Therefore, the carrying amount of such assets would be reduced to fair value.
 There were 
no
 impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Contract Balances
Client contracts under which revenues have been recognized while the Company is not yet able to invoice results in contract assets. Generally, contract assets arise as a result of reallocating revenues when discounts are more heavily weighted in the early years of a multi-year contract, or the client contract has substantive minimum fees that escalate over the term of the contract. 
Contract liabilities are comprised of billings or payments received from the Company’s clients in advance of performance under the contract and are represented in deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets.
Deferred costs to obtain client contracts
The Company capitalizes certain incremental costs of obtaining a client contract if the costs are deemed recoverable. Costs include commissions and bonuses earned by sales teams and leaders due to the execution of client contracts along with associated employer taxes. Capitalized amounts do not include commissions that are contingent on continued employment over a substantive service period. Contingent commissions are accrued as liabilities and expensed over the requisite employment service period. Deferred commissions are amortized over the benefit period of the client contract. Determining the expected benefit period over which to amortize deferred commissions requires judgment. The Company determines the expected benefit period based upon initial contract lengths, expected renewals and the expected benefit of the underlying technology.
Deferred costs to fulfill client contracts 
The Company capitalizes certain costs to fulfill client contracts such as employee salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and associated payroll taxes that are directly related to the implementation of its solutions and some third-party costs. The Company only capitalizes implementation costs that it anticipates will be recoverable under the contract. The Company begins amortizing deferred costs ratably over the 
55    
Table of Contents
expected period of client benefit once access to the SaaS solution is transferred to the client. Deferred costs are amortized over the benefit period of the client contract.

Revenue Recognition
The Company derives primarily all of its revenues from SaaS subscription services charged for the use of its digital banking solutions. Revenues are recognized net of the most likely amount of sales credits and allowances and presented net of sales and usage-based taxes collected from clients on behalf of governmental authorities. SaaS subscription services are generally recognized as revenue over the term of the contract as a series of distinct SaaS services bundled into a single performance obligation. Clients are typically charged a one-time, upfront implementation fee and recurring annual and monthly access fees for the use of the Company’s digital banking solution. Implementation and integration of the digital banking platform is complex, and the Company has determined that the one-time, upfront services are not distinct. In determining whether implementation services are distinct from subscription services, the Company considered various factors including the significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the implementation and subscription service, as well as the inability of the clients’ personnel or other service providers to perform significant portions of the services. As a result, the Company defers any arrangement fees for implementation services and recognizes such amounts over time on a ratable basis as one performance obligation with the underlying subscription revenue commencing when the client goes live on the platform, which corresponds with the date the client obtains access to the Company’s digital banking solution and begins to benefit from the service.
The Company’s performance obligation for the SaaS series of services includes standing ready over the term of the contract to provide access to all of the clients’ users and process any transactions initiated by those users. The Company invoices clients each month for the contracted minimum number of registered users with an additional amount for users in excess of those minimums. The Company recognizes variable consideration related to registered user counts in excess of the contractual minimum amounts each month. SaaS subscription revenues also includes annual and monthly charges for maintenance and support services that are recognized over the subscription term. As mentioned above, SaaS contracts include a single performance obligation that consists of a series of distinct SaaS services transferred over time that are substantially the same each month. Standalone selling prices (“SSP”) are not required to allocate revenue amongst the distinct services within the series.
As a part of its SaaS subscription services, the Company provides certain services within the SaaS platform using third-party applications. Contracts include monthly fees based on a minimum number of transactions and additional fees for transactions in excess of those minimums. Generally, minimum transaction fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Variable consideration earned for transactions in excess of contractual minimums is recognized as revenue in the month the actual transactions are processed. For those services that are processed by third-party applications, management evaluates whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent based upon the transfer of control of the services to the customer. The Company first obtains control of the inputs to the specific application and directs their use to create the combined output. The Company’s control is evidenced by its involvement in the integration of the application on its platform before it is transferred to the client and is further supported by the Company being primarily responsible to the clients and having discretion in establishing pricing. After evaluating each of the applications used to provide SaaS services, the Company has determined that, generally, it is acting as the principal in these transactions. Accordingly, the Company records the revenue on a gross basis and the related expenses are recorded as a component of cost of revenues.
During the term of the contract, clients may purchase additional professional services to modify or enhance their licensed SaaS solutions. These services are distinct performance obligations recognized when control of the enhancement is transferred to the client.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues is comprised primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, travel, and related costs for employees supporting SaaS subscription, implementation and other services. This includes the costs of the implementation, client support, development personnel responsible for maintaining and releasing updates to the platform, as well as third-party cloud-based hosting services. Cost of revenues also includes the direct costs of bill-pay services and other third-party intellectual property included in the Company’s solutions, the amortization of acquired technology, the amortization of capitalized internal use software, and depreciation.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock Options
Stock options are accounted for using the grant date fair value method. Under this method, stock-based compensation expense is measured by the estimated fair value of the granted stock options at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognized over the vesting period with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital.
The determination of the grant date fair value of stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s fair value of common stock, as well as other subjective assumptions, including the volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividends, and weighted-average expected life.
In addition to assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the Company estimates a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for its option awards. The Company’s forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of its actual forfeitures. The Company will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover and other factors.
Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)
RSUs issued vest upon the satisfaction of a time-based condition only. These RSUs are generally earned over a service period of 
three
 to 
four years
 and the compensation expense related to these awards is based on the grant date fair value of the RSUs and is recognized on a ratable basis 
56

over the applicable service period.
The Company estimates a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for its RSU awards. The Company’s forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of its actual forfeitures. The Company will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover and other factors.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company’s 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) permits employees to purchase the Company's common stock through payroll deductions during 
six-month
 offerings. The offering periods begin each May 16 and November 16, or such other period determined by the compensation committee. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 718-50 - Compensation - Stock Compensation, the ability to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock for 
85
% of the lower of the price on the first day of the offering period or the last day of the offering period (i.e., the purchase date) represents an option and, therefore, the ESPP is a compensatory plan. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense is determined based on the grant-date fair value as estimated by applying the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and is recognized over the withholding period. The Company uses only the historical volatility as an input in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Basic and Diluted Loss per Common Share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
Diluted loss per share is calculated by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock, which is comprised of stock options, RSUs, and ESPP obligations, when determining the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding.
Research and Development
Research and development costs consist primarily of personnel-related costs for engineering, information technology and product employees, including salaries, bonuses, other incentive-related compensation, employee benefits and stock-based compensation. In addition, the Company also includes third-party contractor expenses, software development and testing tools, allocated corporate expenses, and other expenses related to developing new solutions and upgrading and enhancing existing solutions.

Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs of sales, marketing and client success employees, including salaries, bonuses, commissions, other incentive-related compensation, employee benefits and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include travel and related costs, outside consulting fees and marketing programs, including lead generation, costs of the Company’s annual client conference, advertising, trade shows, and other event expenses. Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, information technology, security and compliance and other administrative employees, including salaries, bonuses, commissions, other incentive-related compensation, employee benefits and stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses also include accounting, auditing and legal professional services fees, secondary offering costs, travel and other unallocated corporate-related expenses, such as the cost of our facilities, employee relations, corporate telecommunication and software.
Acquisition-Related Expenses, Net 
Acquisition-related expenses, net, include acquisition-related expenses primarily related to accrual of deferred compensation, legal, consulting, and professional fees. In addition, these expenses are inclusive of any gain or loss on revaluation of contingent consideration.
Amortization of Acquired Intangibles

Amortization of acquired intangibles represents the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with business acquisitions, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Concentrations of credit risk arise from the Company’s revenues and accounts receivable. Management believes that its contract acceptance, billing, and collection policies are adequate to minimize potential credit risk. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no client represented more than 10% of accounts receivable. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, no client represented more than 10% of revenues. 
At times, cash deposits may exceed federally insured limits, and the Company is exposed to credit risk on deposits in the event of default by the FIs to the extent account balances exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). Management periodically assesses the financial condition of the institutions to assess credit risk. To date, the Company has not experienced such losses and believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk. 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents and marketable 
57    
Table of Contents
securities. The Company invests its cash equivalents in highly rated money market funds. The Company’s marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by highly rated corporate entities, foreign governments, and the U.S. federal government.

Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax law. Management reviews deferred tax assets to assess their future realization by considering all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed for all or some portion of the deferred tax assets, using a “more likely than not” standard. The assessment considers, among other matters: historical losses, a forecast of future taxable income, the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The Company reassesses the realizability of deferred tax assets regularly, and it will adjust the valuation allowance as sufficient objective positive evidence becomes available.
The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions with the presumption of audit detection and applies a “more likely than not” standard to determine the recognition of any tax benefits derived from positions taken in various federal and state filings. The Company recognizes liabilities when it believes that an uncertain tax position may not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. The Company’s policy is to accrue interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may differ from the amounts recognized.
Business Combinations 
The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of business combinations accounting. The Company recognizes the consideration transferred (i.e., purchase price) in a business combination as well as the acquired business’ identifiable assets, liabilities, and any non-controlling interests at their acquisition date fair value. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities, and non-controlling interest, is recorded as goodwill in the consolidated financial statements. Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly and record any adjustments to its preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.
For acquisitions involving additional consideration to be transferred to the selling parties in the event certain future events occur or conditions are met (“contingent consideration”), the Company recognizes the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the business combination. Contingent consideration meeting the criteria to be classified as equity in the consolidated balance sheets is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is recorded within stockholders’ equity (deficit). Contingent consideration classified as a liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved, with any changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets with determinable economic lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. The Company’s intangible assets are largely acquired in business combinations and include customer relationships, developed technology, and trade names. Intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of the contractual life or the estimated useful life. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis.
Estimated useful lives for intangible assets primarily consist of the following:
Customer relationships - 
15
 years
Developed technology - 
5
 or 
7
 years
Trade name - 
2
 or 
10
 years
Amortization of acquired developed technologies is included in cost of revenues, and amortization of acquired customer relationships and trade names is included in amortization of acquired intangibles in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Management tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. This includes, but is not limited to, significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.
 There were 
no
 impairments of intangible assets during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not 
58    
Table of Contents
amortized, but rather the carrying amounts of these assets are assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The Company has the option of first analyzing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. However, the Company may elect to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist. As the Company operates in a single reporting unit, the impairment testing is performed at the consolidated entity level.
During 2024, the Company performed a qualitative goodwill assessment. The Company’s assessments indicated that there was 
no
 goodwill impairment for the Company’s single reporting unit as of its annual assessment date.
During 2023 and 2022, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill assessment. The Company’s assessments indicated that there was

Note 7.  
Debt
On July 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the Company’s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of April 29, 2022 (as amended, the “Amended Credit Agreement”), with Silicon Valley Bank, a division of First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company, as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto. The Second Amendment, among other things, (i) extended the maturity date of the revolving commitment (“Revolving Facility”) from April 29, 2026 to April 29, 2027, (ii) increased the amount of the Revolving Facility commitment by $
65.0
 million, for a total Revolving Facility of $
125.0
 million, (iii) increased the accordion feature from $
50.0
 million to $
100.0
 million, (iv) modified certain existing covenants, including increasing the minimum trailing four quarters free cash flow requirement to $(
25.0
) million, and (v) for any fiscal quarter ending after the financial covenant trigger date (which was extended to April 28, 2026 or such earlier date as designated by the Company) (the “Financial Covenant Trigger Date”), replaced compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio with compliance with a minimum interest coverage ratio of 
3.0
x. Revolving Facility loans under the Amended Credit Agreement may be voluntarily prepaid and re-borrowed. The Amended Credit Agreement previously provided for a term loan, which was fully repaid in December 2023 and cannot be re-borrowed. The Company has 
no
 outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2024 related to the Amended Credit Agreement. 
Obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company’s subsidiaries and secured by all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to an Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement. The Company has a standby letter of credit in the amount of $
0.3
 million, which serves as security under the lease relating to the Company’s office space that expires in 2033.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants. Before the Financial Covenant Trigger Date, the following covenants are applicable: (i) an annual recurring revenue growth covenant requiring the loan parties to have recurring revenues in any four consecutive fiscal quarter period in an amount that is 
10
% greater than the recurring revenues for the corresponding four consecutive quarter period in the previous year; and (ii) a liquidity (defined as the aggregate amount of cash in bank accounts subject to a control agreement plus availability under the Revolving Facility) covenant, requiring the loan parties to have liquidity, tested on the last day of each calendar month, of $
20.0
 million or more. After the Financial Covenant Trigger Date, the existing annual recurring revenue growth and liquidity financial covenants are no longer applicable, and the following covenants take effect: (i) a consolidated total leverage ratio requiring the ratio, as calculated at the last day of such fiscal quarter for the period of 12 consecutive months then ending, to be less than 
3.50
:1.00; and (ii) a consolidated interest coverage ratio requiring the ratio, for any fiscal quarter ending as calculated at the last day of such fiscal quarter for the period of 12 consecutive months then ending, to be more than 
3.00
:1.00.
The Second Amendment revised the free cash flow covenant, as calculated at the last day of each fiscal quarter for the period of 12 consecutive months then ending, requiring free cash flow to be not less than $(
25.0
) million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 and each fiscal quarter ending thereafter. 
The Amended Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, which if they occur, could result in the termination of commitments under the Amended Credit Agreement, the declaration that all outstanding loans are immediately due and payable, in whole or in part, and the requirement to maintain cash collateral deposits in respect of outstanding letters of credit. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2024.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $
298.5
 million and $
303.6
 million, respectively, of which $
70.5
 million and $
75.6
 million, respectively, are subject to limited carryforward periods and will begin to expire in 2034. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had various apportioned state net operating loss carryforwards of $
228.3
 million and $
211.3
 million, respectively, which are subject to varying carryforward periods that begin to expire in 
2025. Additionally, the Company had $
0.3
 million of federal general business credit carryforwards as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, which will begin to expire in 2035.
The Company’s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to reduce future federal taxable income is subject to potential limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (“Section 382”) and Section 383 and its related tax regulations. The utilization of these attributes may be limited if certain ownership changes by 5% shareholders (as defined in Treasury regulations pursuant to Section 382) and the effects of stock issuances by the Company during any three-year period result in a cumulative change of more than 50% in the beneficial ownership of the Company. At December 31, 2024, $
24.3
 million of the Company’s combined federal net operating loss carryforwards remain subject to the annual Section 382 utilization limitation, of which $
9.5
 million begin to expire in 2034. At December 31, 2024, $
0.3
 million of the Company’s federal general business credit carryforwards are subject to Section 382 limitation, of which $
0.2
 million are expected to expire unutilized. Subsequent ownership changes may further impact the limitation in future years. 
The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of existing deferred tax assets. As part of the evaluation, the Company considered historical losses, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, the duration of statutory carryback and carryforward periods, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. As a result, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company established a valuation allowance of $
127.1
 million and $
109.2
 million, respectively, for its net deferred tax assets as realization of the net deferred tax assets is not reasonably assured based upon a “more likely than not” threshold. The Company excluded the deferred tax liabilities related to certain indefinite-lived intangibles when calculating the valuation allowance, as these liabilities cannot be considered as a source of income when determining the realizability of the net definite-lived deferred tax assets. In addition to these indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities, the Company also has indefinite-lived deferred tax assets which were considered as part of the Company’s net deferred tax position. The valuation allowance increased by $
17.9
 million and $
12.9
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and several state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2020. Operating losses generated in years prior to 2020 remain open to adjustment until the statute of limitations closes for the tax year in which the net operating losses are utilized. The tax years 2020 and forward remain open to examination by all the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject, though the Company is not currently under examination by any major taxing jurisdiction. The Company did not have any uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company’s policy is to accrue interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not recognize any interest or penalties.

 Note 10. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The carrying values of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Cash equivalents include amounts held in money market accounts that are measured at fair value using observable market prices. Marketable securities include debt securities that are measured at fair value using observable inputs.
The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
Level 1.
 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2.
 Significant other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level 3.
 Significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.
The Company evaluates its financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis to determine the appropriate level in which to classify them for each reporting period. 
The following table summarizes the Company’s financial assets measured at fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation:

Note 11. 
Earnings Per Share
Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Because the Company has reported a net loss for 2024, 2023, and 2022, the number of shares used to calculate diluted net loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is the same as the number of shares used to calculate basic net loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders for the period presented because the potentially dilutive shares would have been antidilutive if included in the calculation.

Commitments and Contingencies
Contractual Commitments
The Company has non-cancelable contractual commitments related to third-party products, hosting services and other service costs. The Company is party to several purchase commitments for third-party services that contain both a contractual minimum obligation and a variable obligation based upon usage or other factors which can change on a monthly basis. At December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
38.4
 million of purchase obligations in the next 12 months. 
Legal Proceedings
The Company may become party to various legal actions during the ordinary course of business. Defending such proceedings is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, it may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings during litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained. In addition, the Company’s industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property and proprietary rights. Companies in our industry are often required to defend against litigation claims based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Furthermore, client agreements typically require the Company to indemnify clients against liabilities incurred in connection with claims alleging its solutions infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. From time to time, the Company has been involved in disputes related to patent and other intellectual property rights of third parties, none of which has resulted in material liabilities. The Company expects these types of disputes may continue to arise in the future. Based upon present information, the Company believes that its liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims that are likely to be asserted, is not reasonably likely to be material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities.
Note 13. 
Leases
On September 5, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to its office lease, which, among other things, reduces the leased space in Plano, Texas from approximately 
125,468
 square feet to 
83,939
 square feet, effective December 31, 2023, and also extends the term for the remaining reduced leased space to August 31, 2033. The Company determined that the amendment would be treated as a lease modification. The modification resulted in a remeasurement of the operating lease ROU asset and lease liability, and the effect was an increase to the ROU asset and lease liability of $
3.1
 million and $
2.7
 million, respectively. In addition, the Company recorded a gain on lease modification of $
0.4
 million, which was included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operation.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures at December 31, 2024, the last day of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, at December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, which audited the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our business have been detected.
