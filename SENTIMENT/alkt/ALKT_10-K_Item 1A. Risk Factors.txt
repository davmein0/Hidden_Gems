Risks Relating to Our Business

Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth, and if we do not appropriately manage future growth, if any, or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
We have experienced rapid growth in our headcount and operations and expect to continue to experience rapid growth in the future. This growth has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage our employees. Continued growth could strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel and maintain client and brand satisfaction.
As we expand our business, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture while managing our employee growth. Additionally, our productivity and the quality of our offerings may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. Failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, negatively affect our clients’ satisfaction with our offerings and harm our results of operations. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as we grow, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.
Additionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth and required maturation of our business and operations, the quality of our solutions could suffer, which would negatively affect our brand, operating results and overall business. We may not be able to sustain the diversity and pace of improvements to our offerings successfully or implement systems, processes and controls in an efficient or timely manner or in a manner that does not negatively affect our results of operations. Our failure to improve our systems, processes and controls, or their failure to operate in the intended manner, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to forecast our revenues and expenses accurately.
If we are unable to attract new clients, continue to broaden our existing clients’ use of our solutions or develop and maintain resale agreements with favorable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
To increase our revenues, we will need to continue to attract new clients and succeed in having our current clients expand the use of our solutions across their institutions. In addition, for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our clients renew their subscriptions with us on similar or more favorable terms to us when their existing subscription term expires. Our revenue growth rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including client spending levels, client dissatisfaction with our solutions, decreases in the number of client customers, changes in the type and size of our clients, pricing changes, competitive conditions, the loss of our clients to other competitors and general economic conditions. We cannot assure you that our current clients will renew or expand their use of our solutions. If we are unable to attract new clients or retain or attract new business from current clients, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. The growth of our business also depends on our ability to develop and maintain resale agreements with favorable terms for third-party solutions through our digital banking platform agreements. If we are unable to develop and maintain such resale agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
Growth of our business depends on a strong brand and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand could hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of clients.
We believe that a strong brand is necessary to continue to attract and retain clients. We need to maintain, protect and enhance our brand in order to expand our base of clients. This will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide reliable services that continue to meet the needs of our clients at competitive prices, our ability to maintain our clients’ trust, our ability to continue to develop new functionality and use cases, and our ability to successfully differentiate our services and platform capabilities from competitive products and services, which we may not be able to do effectively. While we may choose to engage in a broader marketing campaign to further promote our brand, this effort may not be successful or cost effective. Our brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or yield increased revenues, and even if they do, any increased revenues may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we are unable to maintain or enhance client awareness in a cost-effective manner, our brand and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
Our corporate reputation is susceptible to damage by actions or statements made by adversaries in legal proceedings, current or former employees or clients, competitors and vendors, as well as members of the investment community and the media. There is a risk that negative information about our company, even if based on false rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. In particular, damage to our reputation could be difficult and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our employee recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of our brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may not accurately predict the long-term rate of client subscription renewals or adoption of our solutions, or any resulting impact on our revenues or results of operations.
We have limited historical data with respect to rates of client subscription renewals and cannot be certain of anticipated renewal rates. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our clients’ satisfaction with our pricing or our solutions or their ability to continue their operations or spending levels. As we sign more contracts, we will generally have an increasing amount of contracts coming up for renewal. If our clients do not renew their subscriptions for our solutions on similar pricing terms, our revenues may decline and it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, as the markets for our solutions continue to develop, we may be unable to attract new clients based on the same subscription model that we have used historically. Moreover, large or influential FI clients may demand more favorable pricing or other contract terms from us. As a result, in the past we have had, and expect to be required in the future, to change our pricing model, reduce our prices or accept other unfavorable contract terms, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our sales cycle can be unpredictable, time-consuming and costly, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our sales process involves educating prospective clients and existing clients about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our solutions and typically lasts from three to 12 months or longer. Prospective clients often undertake a prolonged evaluation process, which typically involves not only our solutions, but also those of our competitors. We spend substantial time, effort and money on our sales and marketing efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. Events affecting our clients’ businesses may occur during the sales cycle that could affect the size or timing of a purchase, contributing to more unpredictability in our business and results of operations. As a result of these factors, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in the future.
We leverage third-party software, content and services for use with our solutions. Performance issues, errors and defects, or failure to successfully integrate or license necessary third-party software, content or services on favorable terms, could cause delays, errors or failures of our solutions, increases

in our expenses and reductions in our sales, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We use software and content licensed from, and services provided by, a variety of third parties in connection with the operation of our solutions. This includes making our applications available through the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store (collectively, the “App Stores”). Any performance issues, errors, bugs or defects in third-party software, content or services could result in errors or a failure of our solutions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the future, we will need to renew existing licenses and license other software, content or services to enhance our solutions and meet evolving client demands and requirements, all on favorable terms. Any limitations in our ability to use third-party software, content or services, including the App Stores, could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays, a reduction in functionality or errors or failures of our solutions until equivalent technology or content is either developed by us or, if available, identified, purchased or licensed and integrated into our solutions. In addition, third-party licenses may expose us to increased risks, including risks associated with the integration of new technology, the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology and our inability to generate revenues from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs, all of which may increase our expenses and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we are unable to effectively integrate our solutions with other systems used by our clients, or if there are performance issues with such third-party systems, our solutions will not operate effectively, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
The Alkami Digital Banking Platform integrates with other third-party systems used by our clients, including core processing and payment systems. We do not have formal arrangements with many of these third-party providers regarding our access to their application program interfaces to enable these client integrations. If we are unable to effectively integrate with third-party systems, our clients’ operations may be disrupted, which could result in disputes with clients, negatively impact client satisfaction and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we are unable to address our clients’ needs or preferences in a timely fashion or further develop and enhance our solutions, or if a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or with the technical support services rendered, we could incur additional costs to address the situation, and clients’ dissatisfaction with our solutions could damage our ability to maintain or expand our client base. If the software of such third-party providers has performance or other problems, such issues may reflect poorly on us and the adoption and renewal of our solutions, which could significantly harm our reputation. Moreover, any negative publicity related to our solutions, regardless of its accuracy or whether the ultimate cause of any poor performance actually results from our products or from the systems of our clients, may further damage our business by affecting our reputation and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our digital banking solutions or our systems and infrastructure fail to meet their needs.
Our business depends on our ability to satisfy our clients and meet their digital banking needs. Our clients use a variety of network infrastructure, hardware and software, and our digital banking solutions must support the specific configuration of our clients’ existing systems, including in many cases the solutions of third-party providers. Our implementation expenses increase when clients have unexpected data, network infrastructure, hardware or software technology challenges, or complex or unanticipated business or regulatory requirements. In addition, our clients typically require complex acceptance testing related to the implementation of our solutions. Implementation delays may also require us to delay revenue recognition under the related sales agreement longer than expected. Further, because we do not fully control our clients’ implementation schedules, if our clients do not allocate the internal resources necessary to meet implementation timelines or if there are unanticipated implementation delays or difficulties as a result of expansions of project scope or otherwise, our revenue recognition may be delayed.
Further, any failure of or delays in our systems could cause service interruptions or impaired system performance. Some of our client agreements require us to issue credits for downtime in excess of certain thresholds and in some instances give our clients the ability to terminate their 
15    
Table of Contents
agreements with us in the event of significant amounts of downtime. If sustained or repeated, these performance issues could reduce the attractiveness of our solutions to new and existing clients, cause us to lose clients, decrease our revenues and lower our renewal rates by existing clients, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, negative publicity resulting from issues related to our client relationships, regardless of accuracy, may adversely affect our ability to attract new clients and maintain and expand our relationships with existing clients.
If the use of our digital banking solutions increases, or if our clients demand more advanced features from our solutions, we will need to devote additional resources to improving our solutions, and we also may need to expand our technical infrastructure at a more rapid pace than we have in the past. This would involve spending substantial amounts to increase our cloud services infrastructure, purchase or lease data center capacity and equipment, upgrade our technology and infrastructure and introduce new or enhanced solutions. It takes a significant amount of time to plan, develop and test changes to our infrastructure, and we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or predict the results we will realize from such improvements. There are inherent risks associated with changing, upgrading, improving and expanding our technical infrastructure. Any failure of our solutions to integrate effectively with future infrastructure and technologies could reduce the demand for our solutions, resulting in client dissatisfaction, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, any expansion of our infrastructure would likely require that we appropriately scale our internal business systems and services organization, including implementation and client support services, to serve our growing client base. If we are unable to respond to these changes or fully and effectively implement them in a cost-effective and timely manner, our service may become ineffective, we may lose clients and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
We depend on data centers operated by third parties and third-party internet hosting providers, principally Amazon Web Services, and any disruption in the operation of these facilities or access to the internet could adversely affect our business.
We primarily serve our clients from third-party data center hosting facilities provided by AWS. We rely upon AWS to operate certain aspects of our solutions, and any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS has in the past and could in the future impair our ability to deliver our solutions to our clients, resulting in client dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of clients and harm to our business. We have architected our solutions and computer systems to use data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Given this, we cannot easily switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, so any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS could increase our operating costs and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we might not be able to secure service from an alternative provider on similar terms.
Our business requires the ongoing availability and uninterrupted operation of internal and external transaction processing systems and services. Our third-party providers of transaction processing and information technology-related functions are ultimately responsible for maintaining their own network security, disaster recovery and system management procedures, and our review processes for such providers may be insufficient to identify, prevent, or mitigate adverse events. The owners and operators of our current and future hosting facilities do not guarantee that our clients’ access to our solutions will be uninterrupted, error-free or secure. We or our third-party providers have in the past and may in the future experience website disruptions, outages and other performance problems. These problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks, fraud, spikes in client usage and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. We do not control the operation of these data center facilities, and such facilities, as well as our own information technology systems, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, power loss, hardware failures, telecommunications failures, improper operation, unauthorized entry, data loss, power loss, cybersecurity and ransomware attacks, fires, wars, terrorist attacks, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, natural disasters or similar catastrophic events. They also could be subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. The occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or terminate our hosting arrangement or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in the delivery of our solutions, cause system interruptions, prevent our clients’ account holders from accessing their accounts online, result in reputational harm and loss of critical data, prevent us from supporting our solutions or cause us to incur additional expense in arranging for new facilities and support.
We also depend on third-party internet-hosting providers and continuous and uninterrupted access to the Internet through third-party bandwidth providers to operate our business. If we lose the services of one or more of our Internet-hosting or bandwidth providers for any reason or if their services are disrupted, for example due to viruses or denial of service or other attacks on their systems, or due to human error, intentional bad acts, power loss, hardware failures, telecommunications failures, fires, wars, terrorist attacks, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes or similar catastrophic events, we could experience disruption in our ability to offer our solutions and adverse perception of our solutions’ reliability, or we could be required to retain the services of replacement providers, which could increase our operating costs and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, prolonged interruption in the availability, or reduction in the speed or other functionality, of our products or services could materially harm our reputation and business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our products and services could cause clients to believe that our products and services are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our products and services, and could permanently harm our reputation and business.
Additionally, as our clients may use our products for critical transactions, any errors, defects or other infrastructure problems could result in damage to such clients’ businesses. These clients could seek significant compensation from us for their losses and our insurance policies may be insufficient to cover a claim. Even if unsuccessful, this type of claim may be time-consuming and costly for us. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Defects, errors or other performance problems in the Alkami Digital Banking Platform could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us, impair our ability to sell our solutions and subject us to substantial liability.
The Alkami Digital Banking Platform is complex and may contain defects or errors when implemented or when new functionality is released, or when we modify, enhance, upgrade and implement new systems, procedures and controls to reflect changes in our business, technological advancements and changing industry trends. From time to time, we have discovered, and may in the future discover, defects or errors in 
16    
Table of Contents
our solutions. Any performance problems or defects in our solutions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Defects, errors or other similar performance problems or disruptions, whether in connection with day-to-day operations or otherwise, could be costly for us, damage our clients’ businesses, harm our reputation and result in reduced sales or a loss of, or delay in, the market acceptance of our solutions. In addition, if we have any such errors, defects or other performance problems, our clients could seek to terminate their contracts, elect not to renew their subscriptions, delay or withhold payment or make claims against us. Any of these actions could result in liability, lost business, increased insurance costs, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, costly litigation or adverse publicity, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our software utilizes open-source software and any defects or security vulnerabilities in such open-source software could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We rely on our management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business.
Our success and future growth depend upon the continued services of our management team, in particular Alex Shootman, our Chief Executive Officer, W. Bryan Hill, our Chief Financial Officer, and other key employees, including in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, services and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. We are also dependent on the continued service of our existing development professionals because of the complexity of our solutions, including complexity arising as a result of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to our clients and, to a lesser extent, us, and the pace of technology changes impacting our clients. We may terminate any employee’s employment at any time, with or without cause, and any employee may resign at any time, with or without cause; however, our employment agreements with our named executive officers provide for the payment of severance under certain circumstances. We have also entered into employment agreements with our other executive officers that provide for the payment of severance under similar circumstances as in our named executive officers’ employment agreements. The loss of one or more of our key employees could harm our business.
Because competition for key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our operations and future growth.
Competition for executive officers, software developers and other key employees in our industry is intense. In particular, we compete with many other companies for executive officers, for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software, as well as for skilled sales and operations professionals and knowledgeable customer support professionals, and we may not be successful in attracting the professionals we need. We may have difficulty hiring and retaining suitably skilled personnel or expanding our research and development organization. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the actual and potential value of the equity awards they receive as part of their overall compensation. Thus, if the perceived value or future value of our stock declines, our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees may be adversely affected. If we fail to attract and retain new employees, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed.
From time to time, we encounter implementation challenges as a result of our clients’ integration and functionality requirements, and when this occurs, we must delay revenue recognition, and in certain circumstances we may never recognize the revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
From time to time we face unexpected challenges related to the complexity of our clients’ integration and functionality requirements. Our expenses increase when clients have unexpected data, hardware or software technology challenges, or complex or unanticipated functionality requirements. In addition, our clients typically require complex acceptance testing related to the implementation of our solutions. Implementation delays may also require us to delay revenue recognition under the related client agreement longer than expected. Further, because we do not fully control our clients’ implementation schedules, if our clients do not allocate the internal resources necessary to meet implementation timelines or if there are unanticipated implementation delays or difficulties as a result of expansions of project scope or otherwise, our revenue recognition may be delayed and in certain circumstances, we may never recognize the revenue. Losses of registered users or any difficulties or delays in implementation processes could cause clients to delay or forego the implementation or future purchases of our solutions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Shifts over time in the number of account holders and registered users of our solutions, their use of our solutions and our clients’ implementation and client support needs could negatively affect our profit margins.
Our profit margins can vary depending on numerous factors, including the scope and complexity of our implementation efforts, the number of account holders and registered users on our solutions, the type, frequency and volume of their use of our solutions and the level of client support services required by our clients. For example, the third-party service offerings that we resell typically have a much higher cost of revenues than the service offerings that we have internally developed, so any increase in sales of third-party services as a proportion of our subscriptions would have an adverse effect on our overall gross margin and results of operations. If we are unable to increase the number of registered users and the number of transactions they perform on our solutions, the types of FIs that purchase our solutions change or the mix of solutions purchased by our clients changes, our profit margins could decrease and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
If we fail to provide high-quality client support, our business and reputation could suffer.
High-quality client support is important to the successful marketing and sale of our solutions and for the renewal of existing client agreements. Providing this level of support requires that our client support personnel have financial services knowledge and expertise, making it difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and scale our support operations. The demand on our client support organization will increase as we expand our business and pursue new clients, and such increased support requirements could require us to devote significant development services and support personnel, which could strain our team and infrastructure and reduce our profit margins. If we do not help our clients quickly resolve any post-implementation issues and provide effective ongoing client support, our ability to sell additional solutions to existing and future clients could suffer and our reputation and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We may acquire or invest in companies, or pursue business partnerships, which may divert our management’s attention or result in dilution to our stockholders, and we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions, investments or partnerships.
We have in the past executed and we may in the future consider executing, strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies, services, solutions and other assets. We may also enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our solutions, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in other companies. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to approvals that are beyond our control. In addition, we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses and the market reaction to our acquisitions may be unfavorable, which may impact our stock price. If an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets, we may incorrectly estimate the value of an acquisition target and we may not be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target. If we are successful in acquiring an additional business, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:
•
our inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services;
•
unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;
•
incurrence of acquisition-related costs;
•
difficulty integrating the technology, accounting systems, operations, control environments and personnel of the acquired business and integrating the acquired business or its employees into our culture;
•
difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy solutions and infrastructure of the acquired business;
•
difficulty converting the clients of the acquired business to our solutions and contract terms, including disparities in licensing terms;
•
additional costs for the support of the professional services model of the acquired company;
•
diversion of management’s attention and other resources;
•
adverse effects to our existing business relationships with business and clients;
•
the issuance of additional equity securities that could dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders;
•
incurrence of debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;
•
incurrence of substantial liabilities;
•
difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired business; and
•
adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges.
In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our results of operations based on this impairment assessment process, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Natural or man-made disasters and other similar events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could significantly disrupt our business, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Any of our operating facilities or infrastructure may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, floods, earthquakes, nuclear disasters, acts of terrorism or other criminal activities, infectious disease outbreaks or pandemic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, power outages and other infrastructure failures, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to operate our business for some period of time. Our facilities would likely be costly to repair or replace, and any such efforts would likely require substantial time. Any disruptions in our operations could harm our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our disaster recovery plans may prove inadequate. We may not carry sufficient business insurance to compensate for losses that may occur, and if such events become more frequent it may adversely impact the cost or availability of insurance going forward. Any such losses or damages could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the facilities of our third-party providers, including AWS, may be harmed or rendered inoperable by such natural or man-made disasters, which could cause disruptions, difficulties or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our use and reliance upon technology and development resources in India may expose us to unanticipated costs and liabilities, which could affect our ability to realize cost savings from our technology operations in India. 
We have expanded our presence abroad by establishing a subsidiary in India during 2024. While its operations are currently immaterial, we may face challenges related to regulatory compliance, tax implications, labor laws, currency fluctuations, and operational scaling in the future. Our current and potential future operations in India are subject to certain risks, including: 
•
difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations as well as additional employment regulations, union workforce negotiations and potential disputes; 
•
heightened exposure to changes in economic, security and political conditions, civil unrest, armed conflicts and acts of terrorism; 
•
different standards of protection for intellectual property rights and confidentiality; 
•
the effects of pandemics, epidemics or other health crises on general health and economic conditions and natural disasters; 
•
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and global market volatility;
•
compliance with local laws and regulations, including privacy and security laws and regulations and labor laws;
•
compliance with laws governing doing business outside the United States, including foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous sanctions and anti-corruption laws, export and import controls, trade restrictions, tariffs, duties, taxes, embargoes, exchange or other government controls;
•
laws and business practices favoring local companies; and 
•
management of potentially adverse tax consequences from India, the United States, or both, as a result of our multi-jurisdiction operations.

The enforcement of intellectual property rights and confidentiality protections in India may not be as effective as in the U.S. or other countries. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive, and we might need to resort to litigation to protect our trade secrets and confidential information. The experience and capabilities of Indian courts in handling intellectual property litigation vary, and outcomes are unpredictable. Further, such litigation may require significant expenditure of cash and a diversion of resources and management attention. An adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 
The historical rate of wage inflation has been higher in India than in the U.S. In addition, if the Rupee strengthens against the U.S. Dollar, our costs will increase. If the cost of technology and development work in India significantly increases or the labor environment in India changes unfavorably, our cost savings may be diminished. With the significant increase in the numbers of foreign businesses that have established operations in India, the competition to attract and retain employees there has increased significantly. If the cost of technology and development work in India significantly increases or the labor environment in India changes unfavorably, we may be unable to cost-effectively retain our current employee base in India or hire additional new talent. Any such developments could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
We are subject to various risks associated with environmental and social matters.
There is increased scrutiny from investors, customers, policymakers, and other stakeholders regarding companies’ management of climate change, human capital, and various other environmental and social matters. While we may from time to time engage in initiatives to manage such matters and address stakeholder expectations, such initiatives can be costly and may not have the desired effect. For example, many environmental and social initiatives leverage methodologies, standards, and data that are complex and continue to evolve. Moreover, various stakeholders have different, and at times conflicting, expectations. Regulatory expectations are likewise not uniform, which may increase the cost or complexity of compliance. Addressing stakeholder expectations can result in a diversion of resources and management attention, and any failure to successfully navigate such expectations, as well as evolving interpretations of any existing governmental laws or requirements, may result in reputational harm, issues attracting and retaining employees or customers, regulatory or investor engagement, or other adverse impacts to our business.
Risks Relating to Cybersecurity, Data Privacy and Artificial Intelligence 
A breach or other compromise of our security measures or those of third parties we rely on could  materially and adversely impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
We rely heavily on hardware, software, technology infrastructure, digital networks and a range of other information technology systems for both internal and external operations that are critical to our business (collectively, “IT Systems”).

We own and manage some of these IT Systems but also rely on IT Systems and related services that are operated, managed, integrated or otherwise provided by a host of third-party service providers, vendors, and business partners.

In addition, certain elements of our solutions process and store PI, including banking and payment data and other PI regarding our clients’ customers, such as social security numbers, and we may also have access to PI during various stages of the implementation process or during the course of providing client support. We, like other organizations, particularly in the financial technology sector, are vulnerable to and have experienced cybersecurity attacks, insider threats and other incidents that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of critical IT Systems and PI or other information regarding clients, client customers, vendors, employees, third-party providers, or our company and business. While to date no attacks or incidents have had a material impact on our operations or financial results, we cannot guarantee that material incidents will not occur in the future. Information security risks for banking and technology companies such as ours have significantly increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties. Because of our position in the financial services industry, we expect to continue to be a target of such threats and attacks. Additionally, geopolitical events and resulting government activity also heighten information security threats and attacks by affected jurisdictions and their sympathizers.
Violations of our policies, procedures and technological safeguards and administrative controls designed to protect our IT Systems and applications have occurred in the past, and there can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes (or those of our third-party providers or partners) will prevent damage to, or interruption or breach of, our IT Systems and operations. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of cybersecurity attacks and other security-related incidents, it is impossible to comprehensively secure IT Systems or the data and PI we maintain in our databases, and we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper or unauthorized access to or disclosure of data or PI, other security events that impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data, PI or our IT Systems, or the related costs of mitigating the consequences from such events. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all losses or that relevant insurance will be available in the future on economic terms or at all. 
Further, the Alkami Digital Banking Platform involves flexible and complex software solutions, which by their very nature are subject to misconfigurations, implementation errors, “bugs,” defects or other security vulnerabilities. And, given the scanning tools we deploy in our broader network environment, we regularly identify, track and patch security vulnerabilities but are unable to comprehensively apply patches or mitigating measures or ensure that patches or measures will be applied before vulnerabilities can be exploited by a threat actor. We have experienced unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to our IT Systems, and we are vulnerable to future attacks that may result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of client customer PI or other data and disruption of our or our clients’ operations. We cannot anticipate or prevent all techniques used by threat actors to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems or implement adequate preventative measures. Additionally, we and client customers integrate our solutions with certain third-party systems used by our clients, which have access to PI and other data about our clients. Our ability to monitor such third parties’ security measures is limited, and a vulnerability in a third-party system with which we integrate could result in a disruption to our IT Systems or unauthorized access to or disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of our clients’ and client customers’ PI and other data, including our business information. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, because we leverage third-party providers, including cloud, software, data center and other critical technology vendors to deliver our solutions to our clients and their customers, we rely heavily on the data security technology practices and policies adopted by these third-party providers. Such third-party providers have access to PI and other data about our clients and employees, and some of these providers in turn subcontract with other third-party providers. Our ability to monitor our third-party providers’ data security is limited. A vulnerability in our third-
19    
Table of Contents
party providers’ software or systems, a failure of our third-party providers’ safeguards, policies or procedures, or a breach of a third-party provider’s software or systems could result in a material compromise to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our IT Systems or the data housed in our third-party solutions. Due to the size and complexity of our technology platform and services, the amount of PI and other data that we store and the number of clients, employees and third-party providers with access to PI and other data, we are vulnerable to a variety of cybersecurity attacks and other security-related incidents and threats, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Cybersecurity attacks and other malicious internet-based activity continue to increase, evolve in nature and become more sophisticated, and providers of digital products and services have been and are expected to continue to be targeted. We have incorporated and may continue to incorporate artificial intelligence/machine learning solutions and features within our business, which may create additional cybersecurity risks or increase cybersecurity risks, including risks of security breaches and incidents. Furthermore, the use of generative artificial intelligence has made it easier for threat actors to develop and evolve attacks. Threats to our IT Systems and those of our third-party providers or clients include those resulting from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, including state-sponsored organizations with significant financial and technological resources, or from accidental technological failure. In addition to traditional computer “hackers,” malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing, ransomware, social engineering attacks, employee theft, unauthorized access or misuse and denial-of-service attacks, sophisticated criminal networks as well as nation-state and nation-state supported actors now engage in attacks, including advanced persistent threat intrusions. We have acquired and will likely continue to acquire companies with cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or unsophisticated security measures, which exposes us to additional cybersecurity, operational, and financial risks.
Any cybersecurity attacks, security breaches, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, computer malware, computer viruses, computer hacking attacks, unauthorized access, coding or configuration errors or similar incidents experienced by us or our third-party providers could result in material

operational disruptions and the material loss, compromise or corruption of client or client customer data (including PI) or data we rely on to provide our solutions, including our analytics initiatives and offerings, and impair our ability to provide our solutions and meet our clients’ requirements, resulting in decreased revenues and otherwise adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such incidents may also result in regulatory investigations and orders, litigation (including class actions), disputes, investigations, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach or penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations. Also, our reputation could suffer irreparable harm, causing our current and prospective clients to decline to use our solutions in the future. Further, we could be forced to expend significant financial and operational resources in response to a security breach, including repairing system damage, increasing security protection costs by deploying additional personnel and modifying or enhancing our protection technologies, investigating and remediating any information security vulnerabilities and defending against and resolving legal and regulatory claims, all of which could divert resources and the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Federal, state and international regulations, including new regulations promulgated by the SEC, may require us or our clients to notify governmental entities, individuals and/or investors of data security incidents involving certain types of PI or IT Systems or that materially impact our business. Security compromises experienced by others in our industry, our clients, our third-party providers or us may lead to public disclosures and widespread negative publicity. Any security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could erode client confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new clients, cause existing clients to elect not to renew or expand their use of our solutions or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we are not able to detect and identify activity on our platform that might be nefarious in nature or design processes or systems to reduce the impact of similar activity at a third-party provider, our clients and/or clients’ customers could suffer material harm, including because many of our products and services are integrated with or connected to our clients’ systems and processes. In such cases, we could face exposure to legal claims, particularly if the client and/or client customer suffered actual harm. We cannot ensure that any limitations of liability provisions in our client and user agreements, contracts with third-party providers and other contracts for a security lapse or breach or other security-related matter would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot ensure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims related to a security incident or breach, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our reputation and our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, our clients contractually require notification of certain data security compromises and include representations and warranties in their contracts with us that our solutions comply with certain legal and technical standards related to data security and privacy and meet certain service levels. In our contracts, a data security compromise or operational disruption impacting us or one of our critical vendors, or system unavailability or damage due to other circumstances, may constitute a material breach and give rise to a client’s right to terminate its contract with us. In these circumstances, it may be difficult or impossible to cure such a breach in order to prevent clients from potentially terminating their contracts with us. 
Privacy and data security concerns, data collection and transfer restrictions, contractual obligations and U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and industry standards related to data privacy, security and protection could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In operating our business and providing services and solutions to our clients, we collect, use, store, transmit and otherwise process sensitive employee and client data, including PI regarding client customers and other individuals, in and across multiple jurisdictions, including at times, across national borders. As a result, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe and around the world, as well as contractual obligations and industry standards, regarding data privacy, security and protection. In many cases, these laws, regulations and industry standards apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between or among us, our subsidiary and other parties with which we have commercial relationships.
Data privacy, information security, and data protection are significant issues in the United States and globally. The regulatory framework 
20    
Table of Contents
governing the collection, processing, storage, use and sharing of certain information, particularly financial and other PI, is rapidly evolving and is likely to continue to be subject to uncertainty and varying interpretations. The occurrence of unanticipated events and development of evolving technologies often rapidly drives the adoption of legislation or regulation affecting the use, collection or other processing of data and manner in which we conduct our business. We publicly post documentation regarding our practices concerning the collection, processing, use and disclosure of information. We may at times fail to comply with our published policies and documents or be alleged to have failed to do so. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies or any applicable privacy, security or data protection, information security or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, orders or industry standards in one or more jurisdictions could expose us to costly litigation, significant awards, fines or judgments, civil and/or criminal penalties or negative publicity, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The publication of our privacy policy and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about data privacy and security can subject us to potential global or U.S. state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We expect that there will continue to be new proposed and adopted laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, in the United States, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission. Additionally, the GLBA (along with its implementing regulations) restricts certain collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, requires notice to individuals of privacy practices and provides individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of certain nonpublic or otherwise legally protected information. These rules also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines.
In addition, every state in which we operate (and the District of Columbia) has laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information. Certain U.S. state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and personal information than international, federal, or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. For example, California enacted CCPA which, among other things, requires companies covered by the legislation to provide new disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new rights, including the right to access and delete certain personal information, as well as the right to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. The CCPA also created a new state agency vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA. The effects of existing state legislation, including the CCPA, are significant and have required and may require us in the future to modify our data collection or processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply and increase our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation. In addition, new privacy and security legislation may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies
Internationally, many jurisdictions have established their own data privacy and security legal framework with which we or our clients may need to comply as client customers travel outside of the United States, including, but not limited to, the European Union (“EU”). The EU’s data protection landscape is currently evolving, resulting in possible significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business. The EU has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which contains numerous requirements and changes from previously existing EU law, including more robust obligations on data processors and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs by companies. In particular, under the GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR’s requirements. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by clients and data subjects.
Because the interpretation and application of many data privacy and protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices, solutions or platform capabilities. Any failure or perceived failure by us, or any third parties with which we do business, to comply with our posted privacy policies, changing consumer expectations, evolving laws, rules and regulations, industry standards, or contractual obligations to which we or such third parties are or may become subject, may result in actions or other claims against us by governmental entities or private actors, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources or the incurrence of significant fines, penalties or other liabilities. In addition, any such action, particularly to the extent we were found to be guilty of violations or otherwise liable for damages, would damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We cannot yet fully determine the impact these or future laws, rules, regulations and industry standards may have on our business or operations. Any such laws, rules and regulations may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions, subject to differing interpretations or may conflict with our current or future practices. Additionally, our clients may be subject to differing privacy laws, rules and legislation, which may mean that they require us to be bound by varying contractual requirements applicable to certain other jurisdictions. Adherence to such contractual requirements may impact our collection, use, processing, storage, sharing and disclosure of various types of information including financial information and other PI, and may mean we become bound by, or voluntarily comply with, self-regulatory or other industry standards relating to these matters that may further change as laws, rules and regulations evolve. Complying with these requirements and changing our policies and practices may be onerous and costly, and we may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to regulatory, legislative and other developments. These changes may in turn impair our ability to offer our existing or planned features, products and services and/or increase our cost of doing business. As we expand our client base, these requirements may vary from client to client, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business.

Risks Relating to Our Industry
We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The market for digital solutions for financial service providers is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology and frequent new product introductions and improvements. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors, including point solution vendors and core processing vendors, many of whom are well-established and enjoy greater resources, as well as from new entrants into the industry, which could include well-established companies with distinct advantages, such as cloud providers, search providers, social media providers and large providers of software to businesses and consumers. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in revenues that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Many of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:
•
greater name recognition and larger client bases;
•
larger sales and marketing budgets and resources;
•
greater client support resources;
•
larger research and development budgets; and
•
substantially greater financial, technical and other resources.
Potential clients may also prefer to continue their relationship with their existing partner rather than change to a new partner regardless of product performance or features. As a result, even if the features of the Alkami Digital Banking Platform are superior, clients may not purchase our solution. In addition, innovative start-up companies, and larger companies that are making significant investments in research and development, may develop similar or superior products and technologies that compete with our solutions. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their market position. As a result, our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and client customer needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities more readily, or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we can. Further, conditions in our industry could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements. These competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, reduced revenues and gross margins and loss of market share. If our clients do not renew their subscriptions for our solutions on similar or more favorable terms to us, our revenues may decline and it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We derive all of our revenues from clients in the financial services industry, and any downturn, consolidation or decrease in technology spend in the financial services industry could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We derive all of our revenues from FIs, whose industry has experienced significant pressure in recent years due to economic and political uncertainty, liquidity concerns, the rapid and sustained increase in interest rates, inflation, exposure to loan assets and lending policies and the value, if any, of underlying collateral and increased regulation. In the recent past, FIs have experienced consolidation, distress and failure, and very few new FIs are being created. It is possible these conditions may continue into the future, and even if conditions improve for FIs, there can be no guarantee that these conditions will not reoccur. If any of our clients fail or merge with, or are acquired by, other entities, such as FIs that have internally developed banking technology solutions or that are not our clients or use our solutions less, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, changes in management of our clients could result in delays or cancellations of the implementation of our solutions. It is also possible that consolidation among FIs could decrease the number of registered users by causing registered users to opt for fewer and deeper FI relationships, and larger FIs that result from business combinations could have greater leverage in negotiating price or other terms with us or could decide to replace some or all of the elements of our solutions.
Our business, financial condition and results of operations could also be materially and adversely affected by weak economic conditions in the financial services industry. Any downturn in the financial services industry may cause potential new clients and existing clients to forego or delay purchasing our solutions or reduce the amount of spend with us, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we fail to respond to evolving technological requirements or introduce adequate enhancements and new features, our digital banking solutions could become obsolete or less competitive.
The market for our solutions is characterized by rapid technological advancements, changes in client requirements and technologies, frequent new product introductions and enhancements and changing regulatory requirements. The life cycles of our solutions are difficult to estimate. Rapid technological changes and the introduction of new products and enhancements by new or existing competitors or large FIs could undermine our current market position. Other means of digital banking may be developed or adopted in the future, and our solutions may not be compatible with these new technologies. In addition, the technological needs of and services provided by, FIs may change if they or their competitors offer new services to account holders. Maintaining adequate research and development resources to meet the demands of the market is essential. The process of developing new technologies and solutions is complex and expensive. The introduction of new solutions by our competitors, the market acceptance of competitive solutions based on new or alternative technologies,  such as artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, or the emergence of new technologies or solutions in the broader financial services industry could render our solutions obsolete or less effective.
The success of any enhanced or new solution depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate testing and market release and acceptance of the solution. Any new solutions that we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain defects or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues. If we are unable to anticipate client requirements or work with our clients successfully on implementing new solutions or features in a timely manner or enhance our existing solutions to meet our clients’ requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

If the market for digital banking solutions develops more slowly than we expect or changes in a way that we fail to anticipate, our sales would suffer and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
Use of, and reliance on, digital banking solutions is still at a relatively early stage, and we do not know whether FIs will continue to adopt digital banking solutions such as ours in the future or whether the market will change in ways we do not anticipate. Many FIs have invested substantial personnel and financial resources in legacy software, and these institutions may be reluctant, unwilling or unable to convert from their existing systems to our solutions. Furthermore, these FIs may be reluctant, unwilling or unable to use digital banking solutions due to various concerns such as the security of their data and reliability of the delivery model. These concerns or other considerations may cause FIs to choose not to adopt our digital banking solutions or to adopt them more slowly than we anticipate, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future success also depends on our ability to sell additional applications and functionality to our current and prospective clients. As we create new applications and enhance our existing solutions, these applications and enhancements may not be attractive to clients. In addition, promoting and selling new and enhanced functionality may require increasingly costly sales and marketing efforts, and if clients choose not to adopt this functionality, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
Our products are marketed to and used by FIs, who are subject to extensive laws and regulations regarding the business functions and activities performed on our software solutions. Changes to any applicable statutes, regulations, rules or policies, including the interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, rules or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of software products we may offer and increasing the ability of third parties to offer competing services and products to FIs. Assuring that our products adapt to changes in the compliance obligations or expectations of our customers requires significant expense and devotion of resources on our part, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.
Our clients and prospective clients, as FIs, are highly regulated and are generally required to comply with stringent regulations in connection with managing their vendors, in particular those that are performing business functions that our solutions address. As a provider of technology services to such FIs, we may in the future be subject to examination by various federal and state regulatory agencies, including those agencies that comprise the FFIEC, and we are also required to review and perform due diligence on certain of our third-party providers. Matters subject to review and examination by the FFIEC, federal and state regulatory agencies and external auditors include, but are not limited to, our internal information technology controls in connection with our performance of data processing services, the agreements giving rise to those processing activities and the design of our solutions, as well as our systems and technical infrastructure, our cybersecurity posture, our business recovery planning, our management and our financial condition. In addition, while we are not regulated by the NCUA, as a result of our registration as a CUSO, we are subject to disclosure, annual reporting and other requirements imposed by the NCUA. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act granted the CFPB authority to promulgate rules and interpret certain federal consumer financial protection laws, some of which apply to the solutions we offer to our clients. In certain circumstances, the CFPB also has examination and supervision powers with respect to service providers who provide a material service to an FI offering consumer financial products and services. While many of our operations are not directly subject to the same regulations applicable to FIs, we are legally and contractually obligated to our clients to provide software solutions and maintain internal systems and processes that comply with certain federal and state regulations applicable to them. Compliance with current or future digital accessibility, privacy, data protection and information security laws to which we or our FI clients are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to fully exploit our capabilities or provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Our failure to offer products and solutions that directly or indirectly comply with such laws, including as interpreted and applied by courts and regulators, could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation and our brand. In recent years, there has been increasing enforcement activity in the areas of digital accessibility, privacy, data protection and information security in various markets in which our customers operate.
For example, as a result of obligations under our client contracts, we are required to comply with certain provisions of the GLBA related to the privacy of consumer information and may be subject to other privacy, security and digital accessibility requirements because of the solutions we provide to FIs. We may also be subject to other laws because of the solutions we provide to FIs. Any inability to satisfy regulatory or contractual expectations in connection with applicable regulations and guidance could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, including attracting and maintaining clients, require significant costs to correct, harm our reputation, or lead to liability to third parties, including our customers or their consumers. Further, if we have to make changes to our internal processes and solutions as result of applicable regulations or guidance or findings from examinations, we could be required to invest substantial additional time and funds and divert time and resources from other corporate purposes to remedy any identified deficiency or gap.
In addition, individual claimants and other third parties, including advocates for the blind or other persons with disabilities, have filed lawsuits or issued cease and desist requests to FIs, including our clients, on grounds that websites or mobile applications offered to consumers do not meet the needs of individuals with a disability within the meaning of Section 3(2) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101, 12102(2) (“ADA”) and the Title III regulations implementing the ADA contained in 28 C.F.R. §§ 36.101, et seq. Third-party advocates and individuals with disabilities seek changes to existing law and regulation, or advocate for novel legal rulings in court, against FIs when desktop websites or mobile applications do not meet or exceed the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 digital accessibility standard, which was developed in part to help ensure that the content developed for banks, credit unions and other FIs can be accessed and used by people with or without disabilities. The evolving, complex and often unpredictable regulatory and litigation environment in which our clients operate could result in our failure to provide compliant solutions, which could result in clients not purchasing our solutions or terminating their contracts with us or the imposition of fines or other liabilities for which we may be responsible or for which our clients may seek indemnity from us. In addition, federal, state and/or foreign agencies may attempt to further regulate our activities in the future which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, existing laws, regulations and guidance could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future growth. In addition, new regulations could require costly changes in our processes, infrastructure or personnel. Finally, actions by regulatory authorities could influence both the decisions our clients make concerning the purchase of our solutions and the timing and implementation of these decisions. Substantial research and development and other corporate resources have been and will continue to be applied to adapt our solutions to this evolving, complex and often unpredictable regulatory environment.

Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property, Software and Third-Party Licenses 
Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.
Our trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. As of December 31, 2023, we had four U.S. registered patents related to automated clearing house transaction notifications and the facilitation of transaction disputes and 24 issued patents, inclusive of U.S. registered patents and international patents, as well as five patent applications pending in the United States, related to our Segmint marketing technology business. We currently own the U.S. registered trademark for the word “Alkami” and certain variants thereof, as well as certain other U.S. registered trademarks relating to our products and services. We also rely on copyright laws to protect computer programs related to our platform and our proprietary technologies, although to date we have not registered for statutory copyright protection. We have registered numerous internet domain names in the United States related to our business. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, various agreements with our employees, independent contractors, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, trade dress, domain name, copyright, patent and trade secret laws in the United States and internationally to protect our brand and other intellectual property rights. Such agreements and laws may be insufficient, breached, or otherwise fail to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology.
Additionally, various factors outside our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services and technologies. For example, we may fail to obtain effective intellectual property protection, or the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective, and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, which could result in them being narrowed in scope or declared invalid or unenforceable. There can be no assurance our intellectual property rights will be sufficient to protect against others offering products or services that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business or that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our technology and use information that we consider proprietary. For example, it is possible that third parties, including our competitors, may obtain patents relating to technologies that overlap or compete with our technology. If third parties obtain patent protection with respect to such technologies, they may assert, and have in the past asserted, that our technology infringes their patents and seek to charge us a licensing fee or otherwise preclude the use of our technology or file suit against us. Additionally, unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property and other information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours.
Any additional investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional trademark, patent or other intellectual property filings could be expensive or time-consuming. We may not be able to obtain protection for our technology and even if we are successful in obtaining effective patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright protection, it is expensive to maintain these rights, both in terms of application and maintenance costs, and the time and cost required to defend our rights could be substantial. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage and protect new intellectual property could hurt our market position and business opportunities. Furthermore, recent changes to U.S. intellectual property laws and possible future changes to U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws and regulations may jeopardize the enforceability and validity of our intellectual property portfolio and harm our ability to obtain patent protection, including for some of our unique business methods. We may be unable to obtain trademark protection for our products and brands, and our existing trademark registrations, and any trademarks that may be used in the future, may not provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. In addition, our trademarks may be contested or found to be unenforceable, weak or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing or otherwise violating them.
We will not be able to protect our intellectual property rights if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights. Additionally, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services, and the laws of certain non-U.S. countries where we do business or may do business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In addition, any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, intellectual property laws may compromise our ability to enforce our trade secret and intellectual property rights. Failure to obtain or maintain protection of our trade secrets or other proprietary information could harm our competitive position and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition to registered intellectual property rights such as trademark registrations, we rely on non-registered proprietary information and technology, such as copyrights, trade secrets, confidential information, know-how and technical information. In order to protect our proprietary information and technology, we rely in part on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, including our employees, investors, independent contractors, corporate collaborators, advisors and other third parties, which place restrictions on the use and disclosure of this intellectual property. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary information or otherwise developed intellectual property for us, including our technology and processes. Individuals not subject to invention assignment agreements may make adverse ownership claims to our current and future intellectual property. Additionally, these agreements may be insufficient or breached, or this intellectual property, including trade secrets, may otherwise be disclosed or become known to our competitors, which could cause us to lose any competitive advantage resulting from this intellectual property. We may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Additionally, to the extent that our employees, independent contractors or other third parties with whom we do business use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. The loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products and services by copying functionality.
To counter infringement or unauthorized use of our intellectual property, we may deem it necessary to file infringement claims, which can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to management. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in this manner may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. An adverse result of such litigation could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable, cause a delay to the development of our products and services, require us to stop selling all or a portion of our products and services, require us to redesign certain components of our platform using alternative non-infringing technology or practices, which could require significant effort and expense. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. An adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings

may expose us to a loss of our competitive position, expose us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.
Some of our products and services contain open-source software, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products and services in a manner that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We use open-source software in our products and services and anticipate using open-source software in the future. Some open-source software licenses require those who distribute open-source software as part of their own software product to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software product or to make available any derivative works of the open-source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost, and we may be subject to such terms. The terms of certain open-source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open-source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide, or distribute the products or services related to, the open-source software subject to those licenses. While we use reasonable efforts to monitor our use of open-source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open-source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur, or could be claimed to have occurred, in part because open-source license terms are often ambiguous. Additionally, we could face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, any open-source software or derivative works that we have developed using such software, which could include proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open-source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated products or services unless and until we can re-engineer such source code in a manner that avoids infringement. This re-engineering process could require us to expend significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete the re-engineering process successfully. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open-source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. There is little legal precedent in this area and any actual or claimed requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could harm our business and could help third parties, including our competitors, develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may be obligated to disclose our proprietary source code to our clients, which may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, reduce the renewals of our solutions and increase the risk of successful hacking attempts.
Some of our client agreements contain provisions permitting the client to become a party to, or a beneficiary of, a source code escrow agreement under which we place the proprietary source code for certain of our products in escrow with a third party. Under these source code escrow agreements, our source code may be released to the client upon the occurrence of specified events, such as in situations of our bankruptcy or insolvency or our failure to support or maintain our products. Disclosing the content of our source code may limit the intellectual property protection we can obtain or maintain for our source code or our products containing that source code and may facilitate intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation claims against us.
Following any such release, we cannot be certain that clients will comply with the restrictions on their use of the source code and we may be unable to monitor and prevent unauthorized disclosure of such source code by clients. Additionally, following any such release, clients may be able to create derivative works based on our source code and may own such derivative works. Any increase in the number of people familiar with our source code as a result of any such release may also increase the risk of a successful hacking attempt. Each of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Claims by others that we infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property or other proprietary technology rights could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Technology companies frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent or trademark infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may be subject to claims by third parties that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us may increase. This risk has been amplified by the increase in patent holding companies that seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained and whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.
From time to time, third parties may assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights against us and FIs with whom we do business. Recently, for instance, a large financial services company has been successfully enforcing certain patents related to the use of remote deposit capture technology--a process that virtually every FI offers to its end users. Any claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights by a third party, even those without merit and regardless of the outcome, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, distract our management from our business, require us to redesign or cease use of such intellectual property, pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits, pay substantial royalty or licensing fees, or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships. The outcome of any allegation is often uncertain. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.
If any of our technologies, products or services are found to infringe upon, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue commercializing or using such technologies, products and services. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, we could be required to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. We also could be forced, including by court order, to cease the commercialization or use of the violating technology, products or services. Accordingly, we may be forced to design around such violated intellectual property, which may be expensive, time-consuming or infeasible. In addition, we could be found liable for significant monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed upon a patent or other intellectual property right. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could similarly harm our business. If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or violation claims 
25    
Table of Contents
against us, such payments, costs or actions could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, in certain of our agreements with clients and licensors of software we use internally or license to our clients, we agree to indemnify them for losses related to, among other things, claims by third parties that our intellectual property infringes upon, misappropriates or violates the intellectual property of such third party. From time to time, clients or licensors have required, and may in the future require, us to indemnify them for such infringement, misappropriation or violation, breach of confidentiality or violation of applicable law, among other things. Some of our indemnity agreements may provide for uncapped liability and some indemnity provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Any legal claims from clients or other third parties could result in substantial liabilities, reputational harm, the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products, and could have adverse effects on our relationships with such clients and other third parties.
If we fail to comply with our obligations under license or technology agreements with third parties, we may be required to pay damages and we could lose license rights that are critical to our business.
We license certain intellectual property, including technologies, data, content and software from third parties, that is important to our business, and in the future we may enter into additional agreements that provide us with licenses to valuable intellectual property or technology. If we fail to comply with any of the obligations under our license agreements, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license. Termination by the licensor would cause us to lose valuable rights, and could prevent us from selling our products and services, or inhibit our ability to commercialize future products and services. Our business would suffer if any current or future licenses terminate, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, if the licensors fail to enforce licensed patents against infringing third parties, if the licensed intellectual property rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, or if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms. In addition, our rights to certain technologies are licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis. The owners of these non-exclusively licensed technologies are therefore free to license them to third parties, including our competitors, on terms that may be superior to those offered to us, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor’s rights. In addition, the agreements under which we license intellectual property or technology from third parties are generally complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations.
If we cannot license rights to use technologies on reasonable terms, we may not be able to commercialize new products in the future.
In the future, we may identify additional third-party intellectual property we may need to license in order to engage in our business, including to develop or commercialize new products or services. However, such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater development or commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. Even if such licenses are available, we may be required to pay the licensor substantial royalties based on sales of our products and services. Such royalties are a component of the cost of our products or services and may affect the margins on our products and services. In addition, such licenses may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same intellectual property licensed to us. If we are unable to enter into the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all, if any necessary licenses are subsequently terminated, if our licensors fail to abide by the terms of the licenses, if our licensors fail to prevent infringement by third parties, or if the licensed intellectual property rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Further, third parties from whom we currently license intellectual property rights could refuse to renew our agreements upon their expiration or could impose additional terms and fees that we otherwise would not deem acceptable requiring us to obtain the intellectual property from another third party, if any is available, or to pay increased licensing fees or be subject to additional restrictions on our use of such third-party intellectual property. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Relating to our Financial Results, Operating History and Capital Structure
Our quarterly and annual results of operations are likely to fluctuate in future periods.
We expect to experience quarterly or annual fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. This makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations or our predictions. Factors that might cause quarterly or annual fluctuations in our results of operations include:
•
the timing of large subscriptions and client terminations, renewals or failures to renew;
•
our ability to attract new clients and retain and grow revenues from existing clients;
•
our ability to maintain, expand, train and achieve an acceptable level of production from our sales and marketing teams;
•
the timing of our introduction of new solutions or updates to existing solutions;
•
our ability to grow and maintain our relationships with our ecosystem of third-party partners, including integration partners and referral partners;
•
the success of our clients’ businesses;
•
new government regulations;
•
changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;
•
the amount and timing of our expenses related to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;
•
any impairment of our intangible assets, capitalized software, long-lived assets or goodwill;
•
future costs related to acquisitions of content, technologies or businesses and their integration;
26    
Table of Contents
•
natural disasters, outbreaks of disease or public health crises; and
•
general economic conditions.
Any one of the factors above, or the cumulative effect of some or all of the factors referred to above, may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results of operations. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet or exceed our internal operating plan. In addition, a percentage of our operating expenses is fixed in nature and is based on forecasted financial performance. In the event of revenue shortfalls, we may not be able to mitigate the negative impact on our results of operations quickly enough to avoid short-term impacts.
Because we recognize revenues from our solutions over the terms of our client agreements, beginning from live use of the service, the impact of changes in the subscriptions for our solutions will not be immediately reflected in our operating results.
We generally recognize revenues from subscription fees paid by clients over their contractual term beginning from live use of the service. As a result, the substantial majority of the revenues we report in each quarter is related to agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a change in the level of new client agreements or implementations in any quarter may have a small impact on our revenues in that quarter but will affect our revenues in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solutions, or changes in our rate of renewals, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period, as we generally recognize subscription revenues from new clients over the applicable subscription terms once they have begun live use of our services.
Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, and our recent success may not be indicative of our future results of operations.
We began business in 2009 and, as a result, have only a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business and future prospects. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries, including the risks described in this document. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected and the market value of our common stock could decline. Further, because we have limited historical financial data and we operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenues and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.
You should not consider our revenue growth rate in recent periods as indicative of our future performance. You should not rely on our revenues for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future revenues or revenue growth. If we are unable to maintain revenue growth, it may be difficult for us to achieve and maintain profitability.
We have a history of operating losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.
Since inception, we have incurred net losses as we have spent significant funds on organizational and start-up activities, to recruit key managers and employees, to develop our solutions and client support resources and for research and development. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods in order to become profitable, and, even if we do increase our revenues, we may not be able to achieve, maintain or increase our profitability. We intend to continue to expend significant resources to support further growth and extend the functionality of our solutions, expand our sales and product development headcount and increase our marketing activities. We will also face increased costs associated with growth, the expansion of our client base, regulatory compliance and information security and the costs of being a public company. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenues enough to offset our increased operating expenses. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in product development and marketing, and we cannot predict whether or when we will achieve or maintain profitability. If we are unable to achieve and maintain profitability, the value of our business and common stock may significantly decrease and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
Our ability to raise capital in a timely manner, if needed in the future, may be limited, or such capital may be unavailable on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to raise capital, if needed, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and any debt or equity issued to raise additional capital may reduce the value of our common stock.
We have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings and receipts generated from clients. We cannot be certain when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business and may require additional funds. Moreover, we do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We also have incurred debt pursuant to our Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below), and the lenders have rights senior to holders of common stock to make claims on our assets. The terms of our Amended Credit Agreement could restrict our operations, and we may be unable to service or repay the debt.
Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to incur debt or issue securities in a future offering will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the impact any future incurrence of debt or issuance of equity securities will have on us. Any future incurrence of debt or issuance of equity securities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
We have incurred substantial NOLs during our history. Under the rules of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership over a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. The applicable rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the stock of a corporation, as well as changes in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the corporation. Section 382 of the Code may further limit our ability to utilize our pre-change NOLs or other pre-change tax attributes if we undergo a future ownership change. We have experienced ownership changes in the past and could experience one or more ownership changes in the future, some of which changes may be outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset post-change taxable income may be subject to limitations. In addition, a portion of our NOLs generated in prior periods, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2034 and 2024 for federal and state purposes, respectively. The remainder of our federal NOL carryforwards, which do not expire and will carry forward indefinitely until utilized, are limited to offset 80% of our taxable income in such taxable year. The remainder of our indefinite state NOLs are subject to varying limitations determined by the respective states. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our future cash flows.
Unanticipated changes in tax laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operations.
We are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, certain non-deductible expenses related to acquisitions, and changes in federal, state, or local tax laws or their interpretation. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our effective tax rate may be favorably or unfavorably affected, impacting our result of operations. The Trump administration has proposed a number of changes to the U.S. tax system. Many aspects of these proposals are unclear or undeveloped, and we are unable to predict which, if any, U.S. tax reform proposals will be enacted into law, and what effects any enacted legislation might have on our tax liabilities. Additionally, an increasing number of states have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or impose additional tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies. Each jurisdiction has different rules and regulations governing sales and use, consumption, and similar taxes. These rules are subject to varying interpretation and could be changed, modified, or applied adversely to us as a result of factors outside of our control. One or more states where we do not collect taxes may successfully assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in material tax assessments, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.

The terms of our Amended Credit Agreement require us to meet certain operating and financial covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our ability to operate our business.
On July 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the Company’s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of April 29, 2022 (as amended, the “Amended Credit Agreement”), with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”), a division of First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company, as Administrative Agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The Second Amendment, among other things, extended the maturity date of the Amended Credit Agreement to April 29, 2027. Our payment obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement reduce cash available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development and other corporate purposes, and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. In addition, indebtedness under the Amended Credit Agreement bears interest at a variable rate, making us vulnerable to increases in market interest rates. If market rates continue to increase, we will have to pay additional interest on this indebtedness, which would further reduce cash available for our other business needs.
We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations.
In addition, our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our subsidiaries and secured by all or substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries’ assets. The security interest granted over our assets could limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. Our Amended Credit Agreement also contains, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, subject to customary exceptions, including restricting our ability to:
•
incur, assume or prepay debt or incur or assume liens;
•
pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;
•
dispose of certain property;
•
enter into sale leaseback transactions;
•
enter into a new line of business;
•
make certain investments, capital expenditures above a certain amount in any fiscal year or acquisitions;
•
complete a significant corporate transaction, such as a merger or sale of our company or its assets; and
•
enter into agreements that prohibit the incurrence of liens or the payment by our subsidiary of dividends and distributions.
In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement includes a number of financial covenants relating to minimum recurring revenues and liquidity levels. Our failure to comply with these restrictions and the other terms and conditions under our Amended Credit Agreement could result in an event of default, which would allow lenders to elect to accelerate our outstanding indebtedness under our Amended Credit Agreement and exercise other remedies as set forth therein. If that were to happen, we may not be able to repay all of the amounts that would become due under our indebtedness or refinance our debt, which could materially harm our business and force us to seek bankruptcy protection.
Any future indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations, could increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and market conditions, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry and impose a 
28

competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options.
We no longer qualify as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2024 and, as a result, we will no longer be able to avail ourselves of certain reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies.
As a result of the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of June 28, 2024 (the last business day of our most recently completed second quarter) exceeding $700.0 million, we became a large accelerated filer under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2024, and no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company.” 
As a large accelerated filer, we are subject to certain disclosure and compliance requirements that apply to other public companies but did not previously apply to us due to our status as an emerging growth company. These requirements include, but are not limited to: 
•
the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 
•
the requirement that we provide three years of audited financial statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;”
•
compliance with any requirements that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or supplement to the auditors’ report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; 
•
the requirement that we provide more detailed disclosures regarding executive compensation; 
•
compliance with the required public company effective dates for any new or revised accounting standards; 
•
the requirement that we hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved;
•
the requirement that annual reports on Form 10-K shall be filed within 60 days after the fiscal year end covered by the report. 
We expect that compliance with these additional requirements will substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs. In addition, any failure to comply with these additional requirements in a timely manner, or at all, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.
Future strategic initiatives, including acquisitions of businesses and strategic investments, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if we fail to integrate the acquired businesses and their employees successfully into our existing operations or achieve the desired results of our initiatives.
We have acquired several businesses since our inception and we may acquire additional businesses in the future. Future acquisitions may require additional debt or equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or negatively affect our financial metrics. Even if we complete acquisitions, there are many factors that could affect whether such acquisition will be beneficial to our business, including, without limitation:
•
payment of above-market prices for acquisitions and higher than anticipated acquisition costs;
•
issuance of common stock as part of the acquisition price or a need to issue stock options or other equity-based compensation to newly-hired employees of target companies, resulting in dilution of ownership to our existing stockholders;
•
reduced profitability if an acquisition is not accretive to our business over either the short term or the long term;
•
difficulties in integrating any acquired companies, personnel, products or other assets into our existing business;
•
delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company, products or other assets;
•
regulatory challenges and becoming subject to additional regulatory requirements;
•
cybersecurity and compliance-related issues;
•
diversion of our management’s time and attention from other business concerns;
•
limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter;
•
unanticipated issues dealing with unfamiliar vendors, service providers or other collaborators of the acquired company;
•
higher costs of integration than we anticipated;
•
write-downs or impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets associated with the acquired company;
•
difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage the acquired business;
•
negative impacts on our relationships with our employees, clients, customers or collaborators;
•
intellectual property and other litigation, other claims or liabilities in connection with the acquisition; and
•
changes in the overall financial model as certain acquired companies may have a different revenue, gross profit margin or operating expense profile.
Further, our ability to benefit from future acquisitions and/or external strategic investments depends on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence, negotiate acceptable terms, evaluate prospective opportunities and bring acquired technologies and/or products to market at acceptable margins and operating expense levels.
We may also discover deficiencies in internal controls, data adequacy and integrity, product quality, regulatory compliance, product liabilities or other undisclosed liabilities that we did not uncover prior to our acquisition or investment, which could result in us becoming subject to penalties, other liabilities or asset impairments. In addition, if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or other external investment as rapidly as expected, or at all, investors or analysts may downgrade our stock.
If these risks materialize, our stock price could be materially adversely affected. Any difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses or unexpected penalties, liabilities or asset impairments in connection with such acquisitions or investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock
Substantial future sales of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. For example, certain significant stockholders sold 5.0 million and 7.5 million shares of our common stock in separate underwritten secondary offerings in August 2024 and November 2024, respectively. We are unable to predict the effect that future sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.
We are currently restricted in our ability, and for the foreseeable future do not intend, to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.
We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors, is currently restricted by our Amended Credit Agreement and may be restricted by the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit. 
The principal stockholders of Alkami will continue to have significant influence over the election of the board of directors and approval of any significant corporate actions.
Our directors, officers and other principal stockholders, in the aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 32% of the outstanding shares of Alkami as of December 31, 2024. These stockholders currently have, and likely will continue to have, significant influence with respect to the election of our board of directors and approval or disapproval of all significant corporate actions. The concentrated voting power of these stockholders could have the effect of delaying or preventing a significant corporate transaction, including an acquisition, divestiture, or merger. This influence over our affairs could, under some circumstances, be adverse to the interests of the other stockholders.
Anti-takeover provisions contained in our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:
•
a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;
•
no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;
•
the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
•
the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;
•
the ability of our board of directors to alter our amended and restated bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval;
•
the required approval of at least 66 2/3% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws or to repeal certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including anti-takeover provisions related to our classified board of directors, voting in the election of directors, rights to fill board vacancies, the ability of our board of directors to alter our amended and restated bylaws without stockholder approval, the inability of stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; 
•
a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;
•
the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and
•
advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions. 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for an exclusive forum in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, and that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that: (i) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware) will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for: (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (B) any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former director, officer, other employee, agent or stockholder to the Company or our stockholders, including, without

limitation, a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (C) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any of our current or former directors, officers, other employees, agents or stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (D) any action asserting a claim related to or involving the Company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; (ii) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (iii) the exclusive forum provisions are intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Company, our officers and directors, the underwriters to any offering giving rise to such complaint, and any other professional or entity whose profession gives authority to a statement made by that person or entity and who has prepared or certified any part of the documents underlying the offering; (iv) any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions; and (v) failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause us irreparable harm, and we will be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. Nothing in our current certificate of incorporation or bylaws or our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in federal court, to the extent that the Exchange Act confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over such claims, subject to applicable law.

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy
We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information. Our cybersecurity risk management program is based on principles set forth in the Secure Controls Framework (SCF). This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, only that we use the SCF as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.
Key elements of our cybersecurity risk management program include:
•
a security team principally responsible for managing our security controls and our response to cybersecurity incidents;
•
a compliance team principally responsible for managing our risk assessments, which are designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems and information;
•
the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security processes;
•
cybersecurity awareness training for our employees, incident response personnel, and senior management; 
•
a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and
•
a 
third-party risk management process for partners and vendors
.
Our cybersecurity risk management program is a key component of our overall process concerning assessment and management of enterprise risk. Risks relating to cybersecurity, data privacy and other information technology risks are overseen by the Information Systems Audit Committee of the Board (the “IS Audit Committee”), and the assessment and management of other enterprise-level risks are overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board.
We face certain continuing and ongoing material risks from cybersecurity threats, which the SEC defines as any potential unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through our information systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information systems or any information residing therein. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Cybersecurity or Data Privacy—A breach or other compromise of our security measures or those of third parties we rely on could materially and adversely impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.” 
Otherwise, however, we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.
Cybersecurity Governance
Our board of directors considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the IS Audit Committee oversight of cybersecurity, data privacy and other information technology risks. The IS Audit Committee oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program.

The IS Audit Committee receives quarterly reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the IS Audit Committee, as necessary, regarding significant cybersecurity incidents. 
The IS Audit Committee reports to the full board of directors regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. Our board of directors also receives briefings from our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) and Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) on our cybersecurity risk management program. Directors receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our CISO as part of the board of directors’ continuing education.

Although our CISO resigned in January of 2025, we have elevated an internal candidate to the role of interim CISO while we search for a replacement. As designed, our CISO and CCO are members of the management team and are primarily responsible for assessing and managing our

material risks from cybersecurity threats, as well as our overall cybersecurity risk management program. As designed, our CISO is responsible for supervising both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants. 
Our interim CISO’s experience includes over 20 years of helping to build global cybersecurity programs in various industries. Our CCO, who is responsible for our technology risk management program, has over 25 years of experience building and leading risk management and compliance programs in large institutions across multiple geographies.

Our management team, led by our 
CISO and CCO
, stays informed about and monitors efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel, threat intelligence and external consultants engaged by us, and alerts and 
reports produced by security tools
 deployed in the information technology environment.
