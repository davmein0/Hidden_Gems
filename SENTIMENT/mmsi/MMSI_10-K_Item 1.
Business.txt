Marketing and Sales
Target Market/Industry.
 Our principal target markets are peripheral intervention (including, renal therapies), cardiac intervention, interventional oncology, critical care and endoscopy. Within these markets our products are used in the following clinical areas: diagnostic and interventional cardiology; interventional radiology; neurointerventional radiology; vascular, general and thoracic surgery; electrophysiology; cardiac rhythm management; interventional pulmonology; interventional nephrology; orthopedic spine surgery; interventional oncology; pain management; breast cancer surgery; outpatient access centers; intensive care; imaging; and interventional gastroenterology.
According to statistics published by the National Center for Health Statistics, cardiovascular disease continues to be a leading cause of death and a significant health problem in the U.S.

Treatment options range from dietary changes to surgery, depending on the nature of the specific disease or disorder. Endovascular techniques, including angioplasty, stenting and endoluminal stent grafts, continue to represent important therapeutic options for the treatment of vascular disease. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. We derive a large percentage of our revenues from sales of products used during percutaneous diagnostic and interventional procedures such as angiography, angioplasty and stent placement, and we intend to pursue additional sales growth by building on our existing market position in both core technology and accessory products.
Marketing Strategy.
 Traditionally, as part of our product sales and marketing efforts, we attend major medical conventions throughout the world pertaining to our target markets and invest in market development including physician training, peer-to-peer education, and patient outreach. Additionally, we are developing digital and direct-to-customer programs to increase awareness of our products, and we work closely with major healthcare facilities and physicians involving our primary target markets in the areas of training, therapy awareness programs, clinical studies and ongoing product research and development. In general, our target markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. We plan to continue to develop and launch innovative products to support clinical trends and to address the increasing demands of these markets.
Product Development Strategy.
 Our product development is focused on identifying and introducing a regular flow of profitable products that meet customer needs. To stay abreast of customer needs, we work closely with health care professionals working in the fields of medicine in which we offer or develop products. Suggestions for new products and product improvements may also come from engineers, marketing and sales personnel, and physicians and technicians who perform clinical procedures.
When we believe that a product suggestion demonstrates a sustainable competitive advantage, meets customer needs, fits strategically and technologically with our business and has a good potential financial return, we generally assemble a “project team” comprised of individuals from our sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, legal and quality assurance departments. This team works to identify the customer requirements, develop the design, compile necessary documentation and testing, and prepare the product for market introduction. We believe that one of our competitive strengths is our capacity to rapidly conceive, design, develop and introduce new products that meet customer needs.
U.S. and International Sales.
 Sales of our products in the U.S. accounted for 59%, 58% and 57% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the U.S., we have dedicated, direct sales organizations primarily focused on selling to end-user physicians, hospitals and alternate site facilities (e.g., office-based labs), major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks.
Internationally, we employ sales representatives and contract with independent dealer organizations and custom procedure tray manufacturers to distribute our products worldwide, including territories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Central and South America, Mexico and Canada. In 2024, our international sales grew 4.8% over our 2023 international sales and accounted for 41% of our net sales. Our largest non-U.S. market is China, which represented 11% of our net sales in 2024 and reported net sales of $149.8 million, $147.3 million, and $149.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We maintain a distribution center and administrative office in Beijing and sales offices in a few major cities in China. We sell our products through more than 500 distributors in mainland China, who are responsible for reselling our products, primarily to hospitals. We use the “modified direct” sales approach in China, employing sales personnel throughout China who work with our distributors to promote the clinical advantages of our products to clinicians and other decision makers at hospitals.
In 2019, China announced a volume-based procurement (“VBP”) policy applicable to medical device manufacturers that is designed to reduce the price of medical devices sold in China. We began experiencing the impact of the VBP policy in 
8

Table of Contents
2022 and 2023 in the form of decreased sales prices and revenue. The negative impacts of the VBP policy persisted in 2024 and we expect to continue to experience these negative impacts in 2025. 
For further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the VBP policy, please
 refer to disclosure under the heading “
Consolidation in the healthcare industry, group purchasing organizations and public cost-containment measures have led to demands for price concessions, which may reduce our revenues and harm our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to support our current business strategies.” 
set forth in Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA), we have both direct and modified direct sales operations. Such sales operations are active throughout the region, including the largest markets in Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Europe and the emerging markets within EMEA.
Our direct sales personnel are principally engaged in each of our divisions. Marketing teams responsible for each division operate clinical education programs, often directed by leading subject matter personnel, who provide technical instruction on techniques and therapies to physicians, nurses and technologists. We are currently conducting education programs specific to radial access, spinal intervention, surgical grafts, wire-free tumor localization, electrophysiology, endoscopy, dialysis and embolism.
We require our international dealers to store products and sell directly to customers within defined sales territories. Each of our products must be approved for sale under the laws of the country in which it is sold. International dealers are responsible for compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as all applicable laws and regulations in their respective countries.
We consider training to be a critical factor in the success of our sales force. Members of our sales force are trained by our clinical marketers, our staff professionals, consulting physicians, and senior field trainers in their respective territories.
OEM Sales.
 Our global OEM Division sells components and finished devices, including molded components, sub-assembled goods, custom kits and bulk non-sterile goods, to medical device manufacturers. These products may be combined with other components and products from other companies and sold under a Merit or customer label. Products sold by our OEM Division can be customized and enhanced to customer specifications, including packaging, labeling and a variety of physical modifications. Our OEM Division serves customers with a staff of regional sales representatives based in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and a dedicated OEM engineering and customer service group.
Customers
We provide products to hospitals and alternate site-based physicians, technicians and nurses. Hospitals and acute care facilities in the U.S. purchase our products through our direct sales force, distributors, OEM partners, or custom procedure tray manufacturers who assemble and combine our products in custom kits and packs. Outside the U.S., hospitals and acute care facilities generally purchase our products through our direct sales force, or, in the absence of a sales force, through independent distributors or OEM partners.
Research and Development
Our research and development operations have been central to our historical growth, and we believe they will be critical to our continued growth. In recent years, our commitment to innovation has led to the introduction of several new products, improvements to our existing products and expansion of our product lines, as well as enhancements and new equipment in our research and development facilities.
We continue to develop new products and make improvements to our existing products utilizing many different sources. In 2024,

our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President of Global Research & Development worked closely with our sales and marketing teams to incorporate feedback from physicians and clinicians in the field, which contributed to innovative new products and improvements to our existing products.
In 2024, we completed projects that resulted in the newest additions to our product lineup: the Wrapsody Device, basixSky™ Inflation Device, MIGHTYwire® Guide Wire, Siege™ Vascular Plug, Bearing nsPVA Express™ Syringe, and 10FoRe™ hemostasis valve.

Competition
Merit operates in the complex, highly competitive and challenging global medical technology marketplace, specifically in the areas of cardiology, radiology, oncology, critical care and endoscopy. This marketplace is characterized by rapid technological advancement, industry and customer consolidation, customer demands for price reductions, regulatory reform, and evolving patient needs. We compete with companies of varying sizes. Many of our competitors are much larger than we are and have access to greater resources. We also compete with smaller companies that sell single or limited numbers of products in specific product lines or geographies. In certain countries, and particularly in China and Japan, we also face competition from domestic medical device companies that may benefit from their status as local suppliers. We also face competition from non-medical device companies offering alternative therapies for disease states that could also be treated using our products.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which our products are sold are quality, price, product features, customer service, breadth of line, and customer relationships. We believe our products are attractive to customers due to their innovative designs, the quality of materials and workmanship, clinical performance, our strong focus on customer needs, and our prompt attention to customer requests. As a company, some of our primary competitive strengths are our relative stability in the marketplace; comprehensive, broad line of ancillary products; manufacturing integration to secure our supply chain; commitment to innovation and strong cadence of new products and product line extensions that enhance our portfolio.

Although we believe our recent and planned additions to these product 
10

Table of Contents
lines will help us compete even more effectively in both the U.S. and international markets, we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing competitive advantages or compete successfully in the future.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Raw materials essential to our business are generally purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of our business. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials has not historically had a material adverse effect on our financial results; however, fluctuations and uncertainties in supply chain, transportation logistics, and freight expenses that we have experienced during the past several years have challenged our operating capabilities and could result in disruptions in our operations and materially impact our financial results. For further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with recent disruptions in supply chain and logistics, please refer to disclosure under the heading “
Disruptions in the supply from third-party vendors of the materials and components used in manufacturing or sterilizing our products could adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition.
” set forth in Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
Proprietary Rights and Litigation
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. We have a number of U.S. and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications, including rights to patents and patent applications acquired through strategic transactions, which relate to various aspects of our products and technology. The duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and, for the U.S., is typically 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application. As of December 31, 2024, we owned approximately 1,900 U.S. and international patents and patent applications.
Additionally, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, our intellectual property assets are critical to our business, but no single patent, trademark or other intellectual property asset is of material importance to our business.
The Merit® name and logo are trademarks in the U.S. and other countries. In addition to the Merit name and logo, we have used, registered or applied for registration of other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products, technologies and services from those of our competitors in the U.S. and foreign countries. See Item 1. “Business - Products” above. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country; in the U.S. we can generally maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use. As of December 31, 2024, we owned approximately 800 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications.
There is substantial litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. At any given time, we may be involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant, as well as a counter-claimant or counter-defendant, in patent, trademark, and other intellectual property infringement actions. If a court rules against us in any intellectual property litigation we could be subject to significant liabilities, be forced to seek licenses from third parties, or be prevented from marketing certain products. In addition, intellectual property litigation is costly and may consume significant time of employees and management.
Regulation 
Corporate Integrity Agreement
. In October 2020, we entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), a five-year agreement that was a condition of our settlement with the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”). The CIA subjects us to certain compliance, monitoring, reporting, certification, oversight and training obligations. The CIA requires, among other matters, that we (i) maintain a compliance officer, a compliance committee, board review and oversight of certain federal healthcare compliance matters and compliance and disclosure programs; (ii) establish compliance policies and procedures to meet the requirements of all federal health care programs and the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)
; (iii) provide management certifications and compliance training and education; (iv) engage an independent review organization to conduct a thorough review of our systems, policies, processes and procedures related to promotional materials, product evaluations, consulting agreements, trainings provided to healthcare professionals, sponsorships, grants and charitable contributions; (v) implement a risk assessment and internal review process; (vi) establish a disclosure program for whistleblowers; (vii) increase oversight of the interactions between our sales personnel and healthcare providers; and (viii) report or disclose certain events and physician payments. We recently completed our fourth reporting period under the CIA and continue to implement compliance program enhancements.

Our failure to comply with our obligations under the CIA could result in monetary penalties and our exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.
The foregoing description of the CIA is qualified in its entirety by the full terms of the CIA, which is attached as 
Exhibit 10.39
 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
Regulatory Approvals
. Our products and operations are global and are subject 
to regulations by the FDA and various other federal and state agencies, as well as by foreign governmental agencies. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that control the design, development, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising, marketing, distribution, import and export, and post-market surveillance of our medical products. Further, approval by one governmental agency does not assure approval by another governmental agency, although sometimes test results from one country can be used in applications for regulatory approval in another country. Finally, changes in government administrations may result in changed administrative or legislative priorities and could also prevent or delay approval of our current or future products, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our current or future products for which we obtain marketing approval.
The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and foreign governmental agencies can be lengthy and complicated given that the regulatory requirements may differ in each jurisdiction. For example, 
in May 2017, the European Union (E.U.) adopted Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (“MDR”), which replaced Council Directive 93/92/EEC (“MDD”) as of May 26, 2021. Under transitional provisions, medical devices with notified body certificates issued under the MDD prior to May 26, 2021, for which we intend to seek approval under the MDR and which meet certain other requirements, may continue to be placed on the E.U. market until December 31, 2027 or December 31, 2028 depending on risk classification. After the expiry of the applicable transitional period, only devices that have been CE marked under the MDR may be placed on the market in the E.U. 
We are preparing to comply with these new regulations under the MDR before the transitional period expires. However, there will be products that we will instead choose to discontinue or postpone introduction in the E.U. This decision will depend on a number of factors, including, without limitation, changing business strategies, timing and cost of obtaining MDR certification, availability of necessary data and the capacity of notified bodies. The MDR includes increasingly stringent requirements in multiple areas, such as pre-market clinical evidence, review of high-risk devices, labeling, post-market surveillance and post-market clinical follow-up. Under the MDR, pre-market clinical data will now be required to obtain CE mark approval for high-risk, new and modified medical devices. 
U.S. and foreign counter-part regulatory approval processes for medical
 devices are expensive, uncertain and lengthy. In certain circumstances, human clinical trials are required for regulatory clearance or approval for devices, which can be expensive, time-consuming and produce uncertain results. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for any product on a timely basis or at all. Delays in, or failure to receive, such approvals, the loss of previously received approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Further, even if a regulatory approval or clearance is issued by the FDA, the FDA may impose post-clearance or post-approval marketing restrictions or other regulatory requirements regarding a medical product that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, operations or prospects. Finally, even after regulatory approval or clearance, Merit is subject to several laws, rules and regulations, and the failure to comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations at any time during the lifecycle of a product, including without limitation, after approval or clearance, may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial proceedings, penalties or sanctions, including refusal by the applicable regulatory authority to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
With respect to regulatory approvals for the Wrapsody Device, in May 2020, we received the CE mark
 and in December 2024, we received premarket approval from the FDA. We continue to seek regulatory approvals for the Wrapsody Device in other jurisdictions. We are conducting a large, multinational pivotal human clinical trial of the Wrapsody Device, which was required for us to obtain approval from the FDA and is required by some foreign regulatory agencies.
 Human clinical trials of a medical device are often required for regulatory clearance or approval for devices and are expensive, time-consuming and uncertain.

Quality System Requirements. 
The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its counterpart non-U.S. laws require us to comply with quality system regulations (“QSR”) pertaining to all aspects of our product design, purchasing and supplier controls, manufacturing, distribution, servicing, complaint handling, corrective and preventive action and internal quality system audits. The FDA, Notified Bodies, and foreign regulators enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers. These requirements are complex, technical and require substantial resources to remain compliant. Our failure or the failure of our distributors or suppliers to maintain compliance with these requirements could result in the shutdown of our manufacturing operations or the recall of our products, or could restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals or certificates from regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, that are necessary for import and export of our products. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business. If one of our suppliers fails to maintain compliance with our quality requirements, we may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result. We also could be subject to injunctions, product seizures, or civil or criminal penalties.
Labeling and Promotion
. 
Our labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA and foreign regulators. Labeling includes not only the label on a device, but also includes any descriptive or informational literature that accompanies or is used to promote the device. Among other things, labeling violates the law if it is false or misleading in any respect or it fails to contain adequate directions for use. Moreover, product claims that are outside the approved or cleared labeling (for example, an uncleared or unapproved use) violate the FDCA and other applicable laws. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, or otherwise violate the FDCA, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a notice of violation, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fines or criminal penalties. Allegations of off-label promotion can also result in enforcement action by federal, state, or foreign enforcement authorities and trigger significant civil or criminal penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and liability under the False Claims Act, discussed further below.
Our product promotion is also subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), which has primary oversight of the advertising of unrestricted devices, including FDA-cleared devices. The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, as well as unfair or deceptive practices such as the dissemination of any false or misleading advertisement pertaining to medical devices. FTC enforcement can result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, consumer redress, rescission of contracts and such other relief as the FTC may deem necessary.
In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims.
Import and Export Requirements.
 Our operations are global and are subject to complex federal and foreign laws relating to the import and export of medical devices. Among other requirements, the laws of the U.S. require imported articles to have their labels accurately marked with the appropriate country of origin, the violation of which may result in confiscation, fines and penalties. Products for export are subject to foreign countries’ import requirements and the exporting requirements of the exporting countries’ regulating bodies, as applicable. 
Additionally, the export of our products is subject to restrictions due to trade and economic sanctions imposed by the U.S., the E.U. and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. With the U.S. and other countries imposing export sanctions on certain countries and actors in response to escalating tensions in certain parts of the world, any such export restrictions may affect the company’s business in certain regions of the world, including the requirement to obtain specific export licenses to enable the continuation of Merit’s business in those regions.
Additional Post-Market Requirements.
 As a medical

device

manufacturer, we are

subject

to

other

post-market requirements in multiple jurisdictions, including (i) product listing, (ii) establishment registration, (iii) Unique Device Identification

(“UDI”), and (iv)

reports

the risks and uncertainties associated with these post-market requirements under the heading “
The FDA regulatory clearance process is extensive and dynamic, and the failure to obtain and maintain required regulatory clearances and approvals could prevent us from commercializing our products.”
 set forth in Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
Reimbursement.
 Our products are generally used in medical procedures that are covered and reimbursed by governmental payers, such as Medicare, and/or private health plans. In general, these third-party payers cover a medical device and/or related procedure in which the device is used only when the payer determines that healthcare outcomes are supported by medical evidence and the device and procedure is medically necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient’s illness or injury. Even if a device has received clearance or approval for marketing by the FDA or, for uses outside of the U.S., a similar foreign regulatory agency, there is no certainty that third-party payers will cover and reimburse for the cost of the device and/or related procedures involving the use of the device. Because of increasing cost-containment pressures, some private payers in the U.S. and government payers in foreign countries may also condition payment on the cost-effectiveness of the device and/or procedure. Even if coverage is available, third-party payers may place restrictions on the circumstances in which they provide coverage or may offer reimbursement that is not sufficient to cover the cost of our products. If healthcare providers such as hospitals and physicians cannot obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products or the procedures in which they are used, this may affect demand for our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could suffer a material adverse impact.
Anti-Corruption Laws.
 Our international operations are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act and other foreign anti-corruption laws. The FCPA prohibits offering, paying, or promising to pay anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining an improper business advantage. The FCPA also requires that we maintain fair and accurate books and records and devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. In certain countries, the individuals and entities that we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the FCPA. As part of our compliance program, we train our U.S. and international employees, and we also train and monitor foreign third parties with whom we contract (e.g., distributors), to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws. Failing to comply with the FCPA or any other anti-corruption law could result in fines, penalties or other adverse consequences. 
As we expand our international operations, we continue to increase the scope of our compliance programs to match the risks relating to the potential for violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws. Our compliance program includes (i) policies addressing not only the FCPA, but also the provisions of a variety of anti-corruption laws in multiple foreign jurisdictions, (ii) provisions relating to books and records that apply to us as a public company, and (iii) effective training for our personnel and relevant third parties.
Transparency Laws. 
The U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and similar state laws, include annual reporting and disclosure requirements for device manufacturers aimed at increasing the transparency of the interactions between device manufacturers and healthcare providers. Reports submitted under these requirements are placed in a public database. A number of other jurisdictions outside the U.S. have also adopted or begun adopting similar transparency laws. In addition to the burden of establishing processes for compliance, if we fail to provide these reports, or if the reports we provide are not accurate, we could be subject to significant penalties.
Anti-Kickback Statutes.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons and entities from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce the purchase, order, lease, or recommendation of a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid, unless the arrangement fits within one of several statutory exemptions or regulatory “safe harbors.” The definition of remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Violations can result in significant penalties, imprisonment and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer would preclude any federal healthcare program from paying for the manufacturer’s products. Under the Affordable Care Act, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is deemed to be a violation of the False Claims Act, which is discussed in more detail below. A party’s failure to fully satisfy the obligations of a regulatory “safe harbor” provision may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement

authorities.
In addition to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, many states have their own anti-kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same exceptions or safe harbors. In some states, these anti-kickback laws apply with respect to all payers, including commercial health insurance companies.

Table of Contents
Government officials continue their vigorous enforcement efforts on the sales and marketing activities of pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies, including the pursuit of cases against individuals or entities that allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers to procure their business. Settlements of these government cases have involved significant fines and penalties and, in some instances, criminal proceedings.
False Claims Laws. 
The False Claims Acts prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a claim paid. The Civil False Claims Act can be violated without actual knowledge and only requires reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance, while the Criminal False Claims Act requires a higher knowledge standard of actual knowledge and intent to violate. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Acts, even if they do not submit claims to the government, if they are found to have caused the submission of false claims (e.g., by third parties such as healthcare providers). The Civil False Claims Act also includes whistleblower provisions that allow private citizens to bring suit against an entity or individual on behalf of the U.S. and to recover a portion of any monetary recovery. Many of the recent, highly publicized settlements in the healthcare industry relating to sales and marketing practices have been cases brought under the Civil False Claims Act. Most states also have adopted statutes or regulations similar to the federal laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Sanctions under the federal False Claims Acts and similar state laws may include civil monetary penalties, treble damages, criminal fines and/or imprisonment.
Labor Standards Laws.
 We are also subject to corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) laws and regulations which require us to monitor the labor standards in our supply chain, including the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the UK Modern Slavery Act, and U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations regarding Combating Trafficking in Persons. These CSR laws and regulations may impose additional processes and supplier management systems and have led certain key customers to impose additional requirements on medical device companies, including audits, as a prerequisite to selling products to such customers, which could result in increased costs for our products, the termination or suspension of certain suppliers, and reductions in our margins and profitability.
Environmental Regulation.
 We are subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and internationally. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in the manufacturing and sterilization process. We believe our policies and practices comply, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We strive to continuously improve our environmental management system with a goal of reducing pollution, minimizing depletion of natural resources and reducing our overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we are working to optimize energy and resource usage, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions, water use and waste.
Privacy and Security.
 Due to Merit’s global presence, we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements of U.S. and foreign governments, those of various regional, provincial, state and local governments, as well those targeted towards our specific industry. More privacy and data security laws and regulations are being adopted and enforced, with increasingly significant fines and financial penalties for violations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. Compliance with these evolving and complex data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations has resulted and will likely continue to result in new compliance challenges and increased costs. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of personal and sensitive personal information, including protected health information, financial information, intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce.
Internationally, Merit is impacted by a number of stringent privacy regimes, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the E.U. and the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”) in China. Non-compliance could result in the imposition of significant fines, penalties, and/or orders to stop non-compliant activities.
In the U.S., data privacy is regulated at the federal and state levels. U.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records (“PHI”), and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers. “Privacy” and “Security” Rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the “HITECH Act”), govern the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information.
Merit may be subject to these laws in certain instances. Additionally, several U.S. states have enacted comprehensive data privacy laws. In general, these laws give residents the right to obtain their personal information from companies, request to have their personal information deleted, and opt out of having that information sold to third parties. The state laws also compel companies to post clear privacy policies that detail the types of personal information they collect about consumers, with whom they share this data, and how consumers can control their personal data. We post on our websites our privacy 
15

Table of Contents
notices, policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data, as well as providing our privacy policies to our employees (including job applicants) by linking to the Merit privacy policy (posted on the Merit website) from our Employee Handbook and our job application board. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy notices or policies or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, or privacy, data protection, information security or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business.
Because privacy and data security laws and regulations continue to expand, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to evolving (and at times inconsistent) governmental interpretation, compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue. Noncompliance with such laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities, as well as harm to reputation, or other consequences. If our customers were to reduce their use of our products and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be materially harmed. We are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these privacy laws.
Seasonality
Our worldwide sales have not historically reflected a significant degree of seasonality; however, customer purchases have historically been lower during the third quarter of the year, as compared to other quarters. This reflects, among other factors, lower demand during summer months in countries in the northern hemisphere.
Sustainability
Under the oversight of our Board of Directors and management team, we continue to make sustainability a key focus of our business. We have a cross-functional Corporate Sustainability Council that is driving long-term environment, social and governance goals across our enterprise. These efforts have included proactive actions to address both risks and opportunities related to our sustainability program, as we strive for continued growth and profitability. 
The majority of our products are disposable medical devices and are generally disposed of after a single use due primarily to the risks of exposing patients to bloodborne pathogens capable of transmitting disease or other potentially infectious materials. Additionally, repeated sterilization to address such risks is not possible because it may adversely affect the quality of the materials used in many of our products and result in the failure of our product to function properly if used in multiple medical procedures. Consequently, many of our used products will likely end up in a medical waste disposal facility at the end of their usefulness. We continually look for opportunities to deliver 
sustainable, long-term growth of our business. Our sustainability practices are an integral component of our business strategy. 
We have identified sustainability opportunities, and
 have developed areas of focus where we are positioned to make a positive impact. These include programs designed to reduce waste, improve efficiencies, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and protect the environment. Our sustainability values in action include:
●
achievement of the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 14001 certification at nine facilities including eight manufacturing facilities (eight in scope) and one large distribution facility (one in scope). A key part of our ISO 14001 program is energy management which includes yearly energy reviews and procurement controls for energy efficient purchasing. (ISO 14001 is the international standard that specifies requirements for an effective environmental management system);
●
establishment and support of employee gardens that promote pollination and provide farm-to-table nutrition for our employees at our headquarters in South Jordan, Utah;
●
use of re-usable pallets where possible and methods to move products in reusable bulk containers, reducing intra-company shipping materials;
●
reduction in water consumption at our water-stressed location in South Jordan, Utah by investing in campus-wide xeriscaping and water recirculation systems within our most water intensive operations;
●
reduction in packaging materials by implementing product family packaging reviews to consolidate shipments by better understanding our customers' purchasing practices-these reviews often allow us to increase quantities

per box, eliminate the usage of intermediate packaging, reduce film thickness and re-use original product packaging where possible;
●
transition from paper work orders to electronic work orders through our internally designed eWorq program. Currently, 69% of our global work orders are managed by eWorq, with a goal to be at 89% by the end of 2025. This project saves millions of pieces of paper and thousands of plastic sleeves annually. Currently, our eWorq program is in place at three of our largest manufacturing sites and in 2024 we estimate that we eliminated 4,223,770 pages of paper. We plan to continue implementing this program at our manufacturing facilities globally to eliminate as much paper as we can within our operations;
●
recycling programs where we recycle materials, including food waste, paper, plastic, cardboard, beverage containers, scrap metal, and pallets;
●
placement of free car charging stations for employees who have transitioned to electric vehicles; 
●
installation of efficient heating and cooling systems that operate on variable efficiency drives, increasing our energy efficiency at our headquarters in South Jordan, Utah and our transition to Light Emitting Diode ("LED") lighting in our global facilities;
●
operation of an environmental tracking system at our world-wide facilities to facilitate monthly reporting and accountability for energy, water, waste, recycling, and scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions metrics—this system supports our 2030 operational sustainability goals; and
●
engaged in a comprehensive materiality assessment to better align environmental, social and governance expectations from our internal and external stakeholders.

Our People
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 7,400 employees located in approximately 40 different countries in a variety of different roles. In the highly competitive medical device industry, we consider attracting, developing, and retaining talented people in technical, operational, marketing, sales, research, management, and other positions to be critical to our overall long-term growth strategy. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent depends on several factors, including our work environment, employee engagement, compensation and benefits, talent and career development, and employee wellness. We invest in our people and cultivate a company culture committed to supporting an inclusive workforce.
Work Environment.
 We strive to create a global work environment where employees feel welcomed, respected, and valued. With this goal in mind, our Chief Human Resources Officer has been charged with working with our leadership team to strengthen and enhance our inclusion efforts company wide. We are committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment. In the U.S., we are an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer committed to making employment decisions without regard to race, religion, ethnicity or national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, protected veteran status or any other characteristics protected by law. To further promote a culture of inclusion, during 2021 we started the Women’s Leadership Initiative (“WLI”), our first ever affinity group led by women and open to all Merit employees. The WLI contributes to our long-term strategies by promoting a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion through (i) sponsoring professional development activities focused on overcoming barriers and restraints to the advancement of women’s careers, (ii) facilitating external interactions with organizations and thought leaders, and (iii) providing resources focused on improving diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Employee Engagement.
 The engagement of our workforce is critical to delivering on our competitive strategy, and we place high importance on informed and engaged employees. We communicate frequently with our employees through a variety of communication methods, including video and written communications, town hall meetings, and our company intranet, and we acknowledge individual contributions to Merit by celebrating milestones of service in five-year increments. Since 2021, we have substantially strengthened our employee communication capabilities through the addition of dedicated internal resources and programs aimed at doing even more to communicate with and engage our workforce. In partnership with the Gallup organization, in 2022 we launched our first ever global employee engagement survey. We repeated this employee engagement survey in 2024. This survey provided us with many insights into the engagement of 
17

our employees from which we have been able to develop action plans at the team and company level in order to further strengthen employee engagement.
Additionally, for four consecutive years, our subsidiary in China has been recognized as a “China Top Employer” by the Top Employers Institute. This award reflects our unwavering commitment to excellence in human resources practices. In selecting recipients of the award, the Top Employers Institute considers a variety of factors, including people strategy, work environment, talent acquisition, learning and development, employee well-being, and diversity and inclusion.
The Merit Way—Our Core Values. 
In 2024, Merit launched a new core values program known as “The Merit Way,” which is an employee culture initiative to preserve the workplace attributes that have contributed to Merit’s success while preparing the organization for the future. The Merit Way is further described with the acronym H.E.A.R.T. as follows:
●
H
ealth – Committed to employee and patient well-being
●
E
xcellence – Deliver your best with the highest of standards
●
A
gility – Decide, act, and adapt to change
●
R
esponsibility – Own your decisions, actions and results
●
T
eamwork – Collaborate and communicate to achieve a common goal.
The Merit Way program aims to reinforce our purpose and create a consistent global culture with common terminology and expectations for all employees. The development of the Merit Way program was a cross-organizational effort which included interviews with employees and leaders, workshops across departments and survey feedback from over 5,000 employees.
Compensation and Benefits.
 Because our mission is to create innovative medical devices that improve lives, we aim to hire and develop employees who want to build something special through hard work, team effort, and commitment. That is why we provide all our employees with competitive total rewards packages and strive to provide the most cost-effective medical benefits and wellness programs. As a result of our focus on competitive health and wellness benefits, we have achieved our tenth consecutive year of zero health care plan cost increases for our U.S. employees who participate in our group healthcare plans. Our total rewards package include competitive pay, annual incentive awards and bonus opportunities, healthcare and retirement benefits, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, paid time off and sick leave, paid parental leave, flexible work schedules, remote working opportunities, and a wellness program. 
Talent Development. 
In 2021, we hired our first ever Director of Global Talent Management who continues to be focused on building and strengthening global programs around strategic talent management, employee performance, development, succession planning and engagement. To improve employee performance, we have begun developing a global performance management program which we expect to officially implement in 2025 using our recently-launched human resources information system. Employee development programs are also being executed at different regional and local levels with a focus on management and leadership development.
Community. 
Our employees are actively involved in their communities and supporting causes. At our headquarters, we provide an onsite garden where employees take part in growing and distributing produce to employees and to the local community. Employees also actively support causes by raising awareness and funds for non-profit organizations. Areas that our employees have supported in recent years include Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Heart Health Month, children’s charities and supporting those in need. In 2024, we continued our support of humanitarian missions through Merit product donations in Belize, Cape Verde, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Mauritius, Nicaragua, Peru and Tanzania. Merit also conducts and/or participates in medical education conferences around the globe.
Wellness. 
Wellness is at the foundation of creating a positive employee experience. At our company headquarters in Utah, we have an onsite medical clinic available for our employees and their families where we provide preventative and general medical care. We have a monthly wellness committee meeting and create a “Get Healthy” wellness program available to all sites across the globe. Programs include providing health information from medical and nutrition experts, newsletters with wellness and dietary tips, and activities promoting health and wellbeing such as walking groups and fitness challenges. Some programs include suicide prevention awareness, on-site diabetes screenings, mental health awareness, lifestyle modification to prevent diseases, tobacco cessation and breast cancer awareness. Additionally, we continue to offer our Smart Choice meal program designed by our onsite dietician and culinary team to provide a free healthy meal option to employees at our Utah headquarters.

Additionally, Merit Medical Ireland has held the KeepWell Mark™ accreditation since 2021, recognizing our commitment to employee wellbeing. This year, our Ireland subsidiary was honored with the “Best in Class - Mental Health” award, reflecting our strong focus on mental health and wellness culture. Retaining the KeepWell Mark™ demonstrates our ongoing dedication to workplace health, safety, and wellbeing, with senior management playing an active role in promoting these values.
Health and Safety. 
Ensuring our employees’ safety is a top priority. We strive to foster a safety-oriented culture, and we maintain an occupational health and safety management system that covers all our employees and contractors. By minimizing risks at our production facilities and implementing training to enhance awareness of hazards, we are able to promote safe practices that can preserve the health of our employees. We maintain high standards for workplace safety, and our orientation for employees includes training about safe procedures. Our programs and policies are in compliance with applicable local, regional, and federal laws, including U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements. We have obtained ISO 45001 certification at six manufacturing facilities (eight in scope) and one distribution facility (one in scope). This is a globally recognized standard for employee occupational health and safety, established by the International Standards Organization, which provides a voluntary framework to identify key occupational health and safety aspects associated with our business helping to deliver continuous improvement. We plan to achieve this certification at our seventh and eighth in scope facilities by the end of 2025.
We also have formal plans in place to protect our employee’s safety in the event of an emergency and maintain emergency action plans that employees receive training on annually. Our emergency action plans describe procedures that employees should follow when faced with a variety of unexpected health and safety events. As part of this initiative, we train certain employees to use automated external defibrillators, provide first aid, and perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In addition, we conduct periodic health and safety audits of our facilities to monitor the effectiveness of our programs and drive continual improvement in our overall safety performance.
