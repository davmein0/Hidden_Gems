Market Information
Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “PCTY”. 
On July 30, 2025, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market was $186.41 per share, and there were 6 holders of record of our common stock. The actual number of holders of common stock is greater than the number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and nominees.
Dividend Policy
We have not declared or paid dividends on our common stock since becoming a publicly traded company. Neither Delaware law nor our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires our board of directors to declare dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to declare cash dividends on our common stock will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.

Overview
We are a leading cloud-based provider of human capital management, or HCM, payroll and spend management software solutions that deliver a comprehensive platform for the modern workforce. Our platform offers an intuitive, easy-to-use product suite that helps businesses streamline and automate HR, payroll and spend management processes, attract and retain talent, and build culture and connection with their employees. We are expanding the spend management capabilities of our platform beyond expense management to include accounts payable automation, corporate cards, and procurement capabilities through the acquisition of Airbase Inc. in October 2024. This integrated platform will enable HR and finance leaders to manage all their spend, including payroll, on a single platform.
Effective management of human capital and business-related spend is a core function in all organizations and requires a significant commitment of resources. Our cloud-based software solutions, combined with our unified database architecture, are highly flexible and configurable and feature a modern, intuitive user experience. Our platform offers automated data integration with hundreds of third-party partner systems, such as 401(k), benefits and insurance provider systems. We plan to continue to invest in research and development efforts that will allow us to offer a broader selection of products to new and existing clients focused on experiences that solve our clients’ challenges.
We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our business by increasing our number of clients, and we intend to invest in our business to achieve this purpose. We market and sell our solutions through our direct sales force. Our sales and marketing expenses have increased as we have added sales representatives and related sales and marketing personnel. We intend to continue to grow our sales and marketing organization across new and existing geographic territories. In addition to growing our number of clients, we intend to grow our revenue over the long term by increasing the number of solutions that clients purchase from us. To do so, we must continue to enhance and grow the number of solutions we offer to advance our platform.
We also believe that delivering a positive service experience is an essential element of our ability to sell our solutions and retain our clients. We supplement our comprehensive software solutions with an integrated implementation and client service organization, all of which are designed to meet the needs of our clients and sales prospects. We expect to continue to invest in and grow our implementation and client service organization as our client base grows.
We will continue to invest across our entire organization as we continue to grow our business over the long term. These investments include increasing the number of personnel across all functional areas, along with improving our solutions and infrastructure to support our growth. The timing and amount of these investments vary based on the rate at which we add new clients and personnel and scale our application development and other activities. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them, which will make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. We expect these investments to increase our costs on an absolute basis, but as we grow our number of clients and our related revenues, we anticipate that we will gain economies of scale and increased operating leverage. As a result, we expect our gross and operating margins will improve over the long term.
Paylocity Holding Corporation is a Delaware corporation, which was formed in November 2013. Our business operations are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiaries.

Key Metrics
We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions.
Revenue Growth
Our recurring revenue model and high annual revenue retention rates provide significant visibility into our future operating results and cash flow from operations. This visibility enables us to better manage and invest in our business. Total revenues increased from $1,174.6 million in fiscal 2023 to $1,402.5 million in fiscal 2024, representing a 19% year-over-year increase. Total revenues increased from $1,402.5 million in fiscal 2024 to $1,595.2 million in fiscal 2025, representing a 14% year-over-year increase. During fiscal 2025, total revenue growth was driven by the strong performance of our sales team and continued annual revenue retention in excess of 92%. Uncertainties around market and economic conditions may impact revenue growth, which we have recently experienced and may continue to experience, through fluctuations in client employee counts, elongated sales cycles, client losses, and a changing interest rate environment, among other factors.
Client Count Growth
We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our business by increasing our number of clients. Excluding clients acquired through acquisitions, we have increased the number of clients using our software solutions from approximately 36,200 as of June 30, 2023 to approximately 41,650 as of June 30, 2025, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 7%. The table below sets forth the total number of clients using our software solutions for the periods indicated, excluding clients acquired through acquisitions, rounded to the nearest fifty.

Client Count
36,200 
39,050 
41,650 
The rate at which we add clients is highly variable period-to-period and highly seasonal as many clients switch solutions during the first calendar quarter of each year. Although many clients have multiple divisions, segments or locations, we only count such clients once for these purposes.
Annual Revenue Retention Rate
Our annual revenue retention rate has been in excess of 92% during each of the past three fiscal years. We calculate our annual revenue retention rate as our total revenue for the preceding 12 months, less the annualized value of revenue lost during the preceding 12 months, divided by our total revenue for the preceding 12 months. We calculate the annualized value of revenue lost by summing the recurring fees paid by lost clients over the previous twelve months prior to their termination if they have been a client for a minimum of twelve months. For those lost clients who became clients within the last twelve months, we sum the recurring fees for the period that they have been a client and then annualize the amount. We exclude interest income on funds held for clients from the revenue retention calculation. We believe that our annual revenue retention rate is an important metric to measure overall client satisfaction and the general quality of our product and service offerings.
Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA
We use Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating results. Our calculations of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA eliminate the impact of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, and these metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
We define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit before amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs and certain acquired intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and other items as described below. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, 
32
Table of Contents
income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes related to stock releases and option exercises and other items as described below.
We disclose Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP measures, because we believe these metrics assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We believe these metrics are commonly used in the financial community to aid in comparisons of similar companies, and we present them to enhance investors’ understanding of our operating performance and cash flows.
Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations include the following:
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our ongoing or future requirements for capital expenditures;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirement to pay our taxes;
•
Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
•
Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.
Additionally, stock-based compensation will continue to be an element of our overall compensation strategy, although we exclude it from Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period.
Because of these limitations, you should not consider Adjusted Gross Profit as an alternative to gross profit or Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to net income, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results, and we use Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental information.
Directly comparable GAAP measures to Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are gross profit and net income, respectively. We reconcile Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA as follows:

Basis of Presentation
Revenues
Recurring and Other Revenue
We generate substantially all of our recurring and other revenue from ongoing subscriptions to our cloud-based software solutions, which are recurring in nature. Recurring fees for each client generally include a base fee in addition to a fee based on the number of client employees and the number of products a client uses. We also charge fees attributable to our preparation of W-2 documents and annual required filings on behalf of our clients. We charge implementation fees for professional services provided to implement our software solutions. Implementations of our solutions typically require one to eight weeks, depending on the size and complexity of each client, at which point the new client’s payroll is first processed using our solution. Our average client size has continued to be over 150 employees. 
While the majority of our agreements with clients are generally cancellable by the client on 60 days’ notice or less, we also have entered into term agreements, which are generally two years in length. Our agreements do not include general rights of return and do not provide clients with the right to take possession of the software supporting the services being provided. We recognize recurring fees in the period in which services are provided and the related performance obligations have been satisfied. We defer implementation fees related to our proprietary products over a period generally up to 24 months. Recurring and other revenue accounted for approximately 93%, 91% and 92% of our total revenues during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.
Interest Income on Funds Held for Clients
We earn interest income on funds held for clients. We collect funds from clients in advance of performing payroll, payroll tax filing and spend management services on behalf of those clients. Until these funds are remitted to the respective payees, we earn interest on these funds through demand deposit accounts with financial institutions with which we have automated clearing house, or ACH, arrangements. We also earn interest by investing a portion of funds held for clients in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists primarily of employee-related expenses, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits, relating to the provision of ongoing client support and implementation activities, payroll tax filing, distribution of printed checks and other materials as well as delivery costs, computing costs, amortization of certain 
34
Table of Contents
acquired intangibles and bank fees associated with client fund transfers. Costs related to recurring support are generally expensed as incurred. Implementation costs related to our proprietary products are capitalized and generally amortized over a period of 7 years. Our cost of revenues is expected to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we increase our client base. However, we expect to realize cost efficiencies over the long term as our business scales, resulting in improved operating leverage and increased margins. 
We also capitalize a portion of our internal-use software costs, which are then primarily amortized as Cost of revenues. We amortized $31.4 million, $45.2 million and $59.9 million of capitalized internal-use software costs in fiscal 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. 
Operating Expenses
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff, including wages, commissions, stock-based compensation, bonuses, benefits, marketing expenses and other related costs. Our sales personnel earn commissions and bonuses for attainment of certain performance criteria based upon new sales throughout the fiscal year. We capitalize certain selling and commission costs related to new contracts or purchases of additional services by our existing clients and generally amortize them over a period of 7 years. 
We will seek to grow our number of clients for the foreseeable future and therefore our sales and marketing expense is expected to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our sales organization and expand our marketing activities.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our research and development and product management staff, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits. Additional expenses include costs related to the development, maintenance, quality assurance and testing of new technologies and ongoing refinement of our existing solutions. Research and development expenses, other than internal-use software costs qualifying for capitalization, are expensed as incurred.
We capitalize a portion of our development costs related to internal-use software. The timing of our capitalized development projects may affect the amount of development costs expensed in any given period. The table below sets forth the amounts of capitalized and expensed research and development expenses for each of fiscal 2023, 2024 and 2025.

We expect to grow our research and development efforts as we continue to broaden our product offerings and extend our technological leadership by investing in the development of new technologies and introducing them to new and existing clients. We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars but to vary as a percentage of total revenue on a period-to-period basis.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, including wages, stock-based compensation, bonuses and benefits for our finance and accounting, legal, information systems, human resources and other administrative departments. Additional expenses include consulting and professional fees, occupancy costs, insurance and other corporate expenses. While we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as our company continues to grow, we expect to realize cost efficiencies as our business scales.

Recurring and other revenue increased primarily as a result of incremental revenues from new and existing clients due to the strong performance by our sales team and continued annual revenue retention in excess of 92%. Excluding clients acquired through acquisitions, the number of clients using our software solutions at June 30, 2025 increased by 7% to approximately 41,650 from approximately 39,050 at June 30, 2024.
Interest Income on Funds Held for Clients
Interest income on funds held for clients for the year ended June 30, 2025 increased by $2.6 million, or 2%, to $123.4 million from $120.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. Interest income on funds held for clients increased slightly, as the positive impact from higher average daily balances of funds held for new and existing clients was mostly offset by lower interest rates as compared to the prior fiscal year.

General and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2025 increased by $25.5 million, or 14%, to $212.9 million from $187.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. The increase in general and administrative expenses

Table of Contents
was primarily due to $14.3 million of additional employee-related costs and a $4.3 million gain related to lease exit activity during the year ended June 30, 2024.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income for the year ended June 30, 2025 decreased by $11.9 million as compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. The change in other income was primarily due to $12.3 million in additional interest expense related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
Our effective tax rates were 25.4% and 26.5% for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2025 were higher than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes.
See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8: “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the components of income tax and a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.
Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
In preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances in accordance with GAAP, we apply various accounting policies that require our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. We consider the policies discussed below critical to understanding our financial statements, as their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment. Management bases its estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors deemed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because the use of estimates is an integral part of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ, and such differences could be material.
Revenue Recognition
We apply Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”), whereby we recognize revenue when we transfer control of goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to for those goods or services. We derive our revenue from contracts with clients substantially all from recurring service fees. Recurring fees are mostly derived from payroll processing and related services such as payroll reporting and tax filing services, time and labor services, time clock rentals, and HR-related software solutions, including employee management and benefits enrollment and administration, substantially all of which are delivered on a monthly basis.
The performance obligations related to recurring services are generally satisfied monthly as services are provided, with fees charged and collected based on a per-employee-per-month fee. We believe that the total fees charged to our clients is indicative of the standalone selling price as these fees are within the range of prices typically charged for our services to our clients. Even though our subscription-based services include multiple performance obligations, we do not believe it is meaningful to determine the standalone selling price for each service separately since these services are delivered and related revenue recognized within the same period. 
We have certain optional performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time including the sales of time clocks and W-2 preparation services. 
Implementation services and other consist mainly of nonrefundable implementation fees, which involve setting up the client in, and loading data into, our cloud-based modules. These implementation activities are considered set-up activities. We have determined that the nonrefundable upfront fees provide certain clients with a material right to renew the contract. Implementation fees are deferred and amortized generally over a period up to 24 months.

Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs
We apply ASC 350-40, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software, to the accounting for costs of internal-use software. Software development costs are capitalized when module development begins, it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. We also capitalize certain costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in significant additional functionality. The capitalization policy provides for the capitalization of certain payroll costs for employees who are directly associated with developing internal-use software as well as certain external direct costs. Capitalized employee costs are limited to the time directly spent on such projects.
Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis, generally over a two- to three-year period while certain projects that support our main processing activities are amortized over ten years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. There was no impairment to capitalized internal-use software during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2024 or 2025. We capitalized $55.6 million, $75.5 million and $75.9 million of internal-use software costs for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively, including stock-based compensation costs of $11.9 million, $14.4 million and $13.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. We amortized $31.4 million, $45.2 million and $59.9 million of capitalized internal-use software costs for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. 
Business Combinations
We include the results of businesses acquired in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price consideration associated with our acquisitions to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition dates, with the excess recorded to goodwill. The purchase price allocations require us to make significant judgments and estimates in determining such fair values, particularly related to the proprietary technology intangible asset. Such estimates used in valuation methodologies can include, but are not limited to, forecasted revenue growth rates,

royalty rates, technology migration rates and required rate of return. These estimates are inherently uncertain and may be refined over the measurement period. Adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary liquidity needs are related to the funding of general business requirements, including working capital requirements, research and development, and capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2025, our principal sources of liquidity were $398.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. We maintain a credit agreement which provides for a $550.0 million revolving credit facility which may be increased up to $825.0 million. No amounts were drawn on the revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2024. In September 2024, we borrowed $325.0

million under this credit facility to fund the October 2024 acquisition of Airbase Inc. We had $162.5

million in outstanding borrowings under this credit facility at June 30, 2025, as we repaid $162.5

million during the second half of fiscal 2025. Refer to Notes 7 and 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8: “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional details on the Airbase acquisition and credit agreement, respectively. 
In April 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock (the “Repurchase Program”). The extent to which we repurchase shares, the number and price of any shares repurchased and the timing of any repurchases depends on the market price of our common stock, trading volume, general market conditions and other corporate and economic considerations. During fiscal 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 1.1 million shares for approximately $150.0 million at an average cost per share of $142.82 under the Repurchase Program. During fiscal 2025, we repurchased 0.8 million shares for approximately $149.6 million at an average cost per share of $190.16 under the Repurchase Program. In July 2025, our board of directors authorized an additional $500 million of our common stock for repurchase under the Repurchase Program. Refer to Notes 15 and 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8: “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional detail on our Repurchase Program. 
We may invest portions of our excess cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. These investments may consist of commercial paper, corporate debt issuances, asset-backed debt securities, 
40
Table of Contents
certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities and other securities with credit quality ratings of A-1 or higher and as well as in money market funds. As of June 30, 2025, we did not have any corporate investments classified as available-for-sale securities.
In order to grow our business, we intend to increase our personnel and related expenses and to make investments in our platform, data centers and general infrastructure, some of which may be significant. The timing and amount of these investments will vary based on our financial condition, the rate at which we add new clients and new personnel and the scale of our module development, data centers and other activities. Many of these investments will occur in advance of experiencing any direct benefit from them, which could negatively impact our liquidity and cash flows during any particular period and may make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. However, we expect to fund our operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and other investments principally with cash flows from operations, and to the extent that our liquidity needs exceed our cash from operations, we would look to our cash on hand or utilize the remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility to satisfy those needs. 
Our payroll and spend management processing activities involve the movement of significant funds from accounts of clients to their employees, relevant taxing authorities and vendors. Funds held for clients and client fund obligations will vary substantially from period to period mostly as a result of the timing of payroll and payroll tax obligations due. Though we debit a client’s account prior to any disbursement on its behalf, there is a delay between when our payments are due and when the incoming funds from the client to cover these amounts payable actually clear into our operating accounts. We currently have agreements with various major U.S. banks to execute ACH and wire transfers to support our services. We believe we have sufficient capacity under these ACH arrangements to handle all transaction volumes for the foreseeable future. We primarily collect fees for our HCM and payroll services via ACH transactions at the same time we debit the client’s account for payroll and payroll tax obligations and thus are able to reduce collectability and accounts receivable risks.
We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, future cash flow from operations, and access to our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing working capital, capital expenditure and other liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months, and thereafter, for the foreseeable future.

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $282.7 million, $384.7 million and $418.2 million for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. 
The change in net cash provided by operating activities from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 was primarily due to improved operating results after adjusting for non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense and deferred income tax expense during the year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2024.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $220.2 million, $101.9 million and $455.5 million, for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities is significantly impacted by the timing of purchases and sales and maturities of investments as we may invest a portion of our excess cash and cash equivalents and funds held for clients in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. The amount of funds held for clients invested will vary based on timing of client funds collected and payments due to client employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities. 
The change in net cash used in investing activities from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 was primarily due to $265.8 million in additional amounts paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, associated with the fiscal 2025 acquisition of Airbase. It was also attributable to $134.4 million in less proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by $43.5 million in less purchases of available-for-sale securities as compared to the year ended June 30, 2024.

Financing Activities
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1,434.7) million, $141.6 million and $(325.8) million for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 was primarily due to the change in client fund obligations of $623.0 million due to the timing of client funds collected and related remittance of those funds to client employees, taxing and other regulatory authorities and vendors during the year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. The change in client fund obligations was offset by $162.5 million in net borrowings on our credit facility as we borrowed $325.0 million in September 2024 to acquire Airbase of which we repaid $162.5 million during the year ended June 30, 2025. 
Capital Expenditures
We expect to continue to invest in capital spending as we continue to grow our business and expand and enhance our operating facilities, data centers and technical infrastructure. Future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth. In the event that our sales growth or other factors do not meet our expectations, we may eliminate or curtail capital projects in order to mitigate the impact on our use of cash. Capital expenditures were $21.9 million, $18.0 million and $13.1 million for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively, exclusive of capitalized internal-use software costs of $45.0 million, $60.7 million, and $62.4 million for the same periods, respectively. 
Contractual Obligations
At June 30, 2025, our principal commitments consist of $162.5 million in borrowings on our revolving credit facility, which is contractually not due in the next twelve months, and related interest payments, as well as $64.6 million in operating lease obligations, of which $11.0 million is due in the next twelve months. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8: “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional details on our lease activity. We also have $95.5 million in purchase obligations, of which $57.6 million is due in the next twelve months.
New Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8: “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
Substantially all of our operations take place in the United States and are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate and certain other exposures as well as risks relating to changes in the general economic conditions in the United States. We have not used, nor do we intend to use, derivatives to mitigate the impact of interest rate or other exposure or for trading or speculative purposes.
Interest Rate Risk
As of June 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $398.1 million and funds held for clients of $2,704.1 million. We deposit our cash and cash equivalents and significant portions of our funds held for clients in demand deposit accounts with various financial institutions. We may invest portions of our excess cash and cash equivalents and funds held for clients in marketable securities including money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt issuances, asset-backed debt securities, U.S. treasury securities, and other securities. Our investment policy is focused on generating higher yields from these investments while preserving liquidity and capital. However, as a result of our investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our financial statements. 
In a falling rate environment, a decline in interest rates would decrease our interest income earned on both cash and cash equivalents and funds held for clients. An increase in the overall interest rate environment may cause the market value of our investments in fixed rate available-for-sale securities to decline. If we are forced to sell some or all of these securities at lower market values, we may incur investment losses. However, because we classify all marketable securities as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates until such securities are sold or decreases in fair value are deemed due to expected credit losses. We have not recorded credit impairment losses on our portfolio to date.
43
Table of Contents
 Based upon a sensitivity model that measures market value changes caused by interest rate fluctuations, an immediate 100-basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the market value of our available-for-sale securities by $12.0 million as of June 30, 2025. An immediate 100-basis point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the market value of our available-for-sale securities by $12.0 million as of June 30, 2025. Fluctuations in the value of our available-for-sale securities caused by changes in interest rates are recorded in other comprehensive income and are only realized if we sell the underlying securities.
Additionally, as described in 
Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8: “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”
, we entered into a first amendment to our credit agreement that provides for a revolving credit facility (“credit facility”) in the aggregate amount of 
$550.0
 million, which may be increased up to 
$825.0
 million. Borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at a rate based upon the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus the SOFR Adjustment or an adjusted base rate plus an applicable margin based on our then-applicable net total leverage ratio. As of 
June 30, 2025
, we had 
$162.5

million in borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. Because interest rates applicable to the credit facility are variable, we are exposed to market risk from changes in the underlying index rates, which affects our interest expense. A hypothetical change of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have had a significant impact on our results of operations. 
Inflation Risk
We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2025, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) 
44
Table of Contents
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation under the Internal Control—Integrated Framework, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2025.
The Company acquired Airbase Inc. (“Airbase”) in October 2024. Management excluded Airbase from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025. Airbase represented 9% of the Company’s Total assets and less than 2% of the Company’s Total revenues, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2025. 
Our independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited our financial statements, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 15(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2025, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
Paylocity Holding Corporation:
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Paylocity Holding Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025 based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The Company acquired Airbase Inc. during October 2024, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, Airbase Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting associated with 9% of the Company’s Total assets and less than 2% of the Company’s Total revenues included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended June 30, 2025. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Airbase Inc.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Capitalized internal-use software development costs
As discussed in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company capitalizes certain internal-use software costs related to new products as well as existing products when those costs will result in significant additional functionality. The Company’s capitalized internal-use software asset, net of accumulated amortization, was $132.3 million as of June 30, 2025. The Company capitalized approximately $75.9 million of internal-use software costs during the year ended June 30, 2025.
We identified the determination of capitalized internal-use software development costs as a critical audit matter because of the degree of subjectivity involved in assessing which projects met the capitalization criteria.
The following are primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control related to the critical audit matter. This control related to the determination of which software development projects met the capitalization criteria. For a selection of current year capitalized software costs, we evaluated the Company’s determination to capitalize the costs by reading the Company’s analysis and discussing the objective and status of the projects with IT department management. We also assessed a sample of the Company’s capitalized costs by confirming the nature of the activities performed with individual software developers.
Fair value of proprietary technology intangible asset
As discussed in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, on October 1, 2024, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Airbase Inc. (Airbase). As a result of the transaction, the Company acquired a proprietary technology intangible asset with an acquisition-date fair value of $75.2 million.
We identified the evaluation of the acquisition-date fair value of the proprietary technology intangible asset acquired in the Airbase acquisition as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to assess certain assumptions used to estimate fair value, specifically the forecasted revenue growth rates and the royalty rate. Changes in these assumptions could have had a significant impact on the fair value of the proprietary technology intangible asset. Additionally, the audit effort associated with this estimate required specialized skills and knowledge.

Table of Contents
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s fair value measurement process for the Airbase acquisition, including controls related to the determination of the assumptions noted above. We evaluated the forecasted revenue growth rates used by the Company by comparing them to the growth rates of peer companies and industry data. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted us in evaluating the Company’s selected royalty rate by comparing it to the royalty rates obtained from publicly available data for comparable licensing agreements at the acquisition date.

PAYLOCITY HOLDING CORPORATION
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(all amounts in thousands, except per share data)
(1) Organization and Description of Business
Paylocity Holding Corporation (the “Company”) is a cloud-based provider of human capital management, payroll and spend management software solutions that deliver a comprehensive platform for the modern workforce. Services are provided in a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) delivery model. The Company offers an intuitive, easy-to-use product suite that helps businesses streamline and automate HR, payroll and spend management processes, attract and retain talent, and build culture and connection with their employees.
(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a) 
Basis of Presentation, Consolidation, and Use of Estimates
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; accordingly, accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. Accounting estimates used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the operating environment changes.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
(b) 
Concentrations of Risk
The Company regularly maintains cash balances that exceed Federal Depository Insurance Corporation limits. No individual client represents 10% or more of total revenues. For all periods presented, substantially all of total revenues were generated by clients in the United States.
(c) 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Any interest earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents is reported as Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
(d) 
Funds Held For Clients and Client Fund Obligations
The Company obtains funds from clients in advance of performing payroll, payroll tax filing and spend management services on behalf of those clients. Funds held for clients represent assets that are used solely for the purposes of satisfying the obligations to remit funds relating to payroll, payroll tax filing and spend management services. The Company has classified Funds held for clients as a current asset since these funds are held solely for the purposes of satisfying the client fund obligations. Funds held for clients is primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents invested in demand deposit accounts. The Company also invests a portion of its funds held for clients and corporate funds in marketable securities.
Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, are reported as Other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Interest on marketable securities included in Funds held for clients is reported as Interest income on funds held for clients in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
F-9
Table of Contents
The Company evaluates whether a decline in an individual security’s fair value as compared to its amortized cost basis resulted from credit loss or other factors. If the Company determines that an individual security’s unrealized loss results from credit impairment, it compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the impaired security with its amortized cost basis. If the security’s amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of expected cash flows, the Company records credit impairment loss through an allowance for credit loss. The Company did 
not
 recognize any credit impairment losses during the years ended June 30, 2023, 2024 or 2025.
Client fund obligations represent the Company’s contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy clients’ payroll, tax and spend management payment obligations and are recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time that the Company obtains funds from clients. The client fund obligations represent liabilities that will be repaid within 
one year
 of the balance sheet date.
(e) 
Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable is comprised of trade receivables, accrued interest on funds held for clients and other receivables. Trade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Amounts collected on accounts receivable are included in Net cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses reflecting expected credit losses in its accounts receivable portfolio. In establishing the required allowance, management considers historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and the Company’s clients’ financial conditions, the amount of receivables in dispute, the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses quarterly. Past due balances over 
60
 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectability. All other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all commercially reasonable means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its clients.
(f) 
Deferred Contract Costs
The Company defers certain selling and commission costs that meet the capitalization criteria under ASC 340-40. The Company also capitalizes certain costs to fulfill a contract related to its proprietary products if they are identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations and are expected to be recovered under ASC 340-40. Implementation fees are treated as nonrefundable upfront fees and the related implementation costs are required to be capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit, which is the period in which the Company expects to recover the costs and enhance its ability to satisfy future performance obligations. 
The Company utilizes the portfolio approach to account for both the cost of obtaining a contract and the cost of fulfilling a contract. These capitalized costs are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which has been determined to be generally over 
7
 years based on the Company’s average client life and other qualitative factors, including rate of technological changes. The Company does not incur any additional costs to obtain or fulfill contracts upon renewal. The Company recognizes additional selling and commission costs and fulfillment costs when an existing client purchases additional services. These additional costs only relate to the additional services purchased and do not relate to the renewal of previous services. Management evaluates deferred contract costs for impairment if changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of the costs to obtain or fulfill contracts with the Company’s customers.
(g) 
Capitalized

Internal-Use Software
The Company capitalizes internal-use software costs when module development begins, it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used as intended. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. The Company also capitalizes certain costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in significant additional functionality. The capitalization policy provides for the capitalization of certain payroll costs for employees who are directly associated with developing internal-use software as well as certain external direct costs, such as consulting fees. Capitalized employee costs are limited to the time directly spent on such projects.
Capitalized internal-use software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are generally 
two
 to three years while certain projects that support the Company’s main processing activities have an estimated useful life of 
ten years
. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.
F-10
Table of Contents
(h) 
Property and Equipment and Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on property and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 
three
 to 
seven years
 for most classes of assets, or over the term of the related lease for leasehold improvements.
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.
(i) 
Business Combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. It allocates the purchase price consideration associated with its acquisitions to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition dates, with the excess recorded to goodwill. Estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the use of significant judgments and estimates, which are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as additional information becomes available. Adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. The Company may engage a valuation specialist to assist in the fair value measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each acquisition.
(j) 
Intangible Assets, Net of Accumulated Amortization
Intangible assets are comprised primarily of acquired client relationships, proprietary technology, trade names and non-solicitation agreements and are reported net of accumulated amortization on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company uses the straight-line method of amortization to amortize client relationships over a 
five
 to 
nine-year
 period from the date of acquisition, proprietary technology over a 
five
 to 
seven-year
 period from the date of acquisition and trade names over a 
five-year
 period from the date of acquisition. Non-solicitation agreements use the straight-line method of amortization over the term of the related agreements. The Company tests intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
(k) 
Goodwill
Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company would record an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. 
The Company performs its annual impairment review of goodwill in its fiscal fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs between annual impairment tests. 
No
 impairment was recorded in fiscal 2023, 2024 or 2025 as a result of the Company’s qualitative assessments over its single reporting segment.
F-11
Table of Contents
(l) 
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at agreement inception. Operating leases are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets, Accrued expenses, and Long-term operating lease liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made at or before the commencement date and are reduced by any lease incentives received. The Company’s lease terms may include options to renew or extend a lease. The Company recognizes amounts in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain it will exercise such options. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. 
The Company’s most significant leases are real estate leases of office space. The remaining operating leases are primarily comprised of leases of printers and other equipment. For all leases, the Company has elected the practical expedient permitted under Topic 842 to combine lease and non-lease components. As a result, non-lease components, such as common area or equipment maintenance charges, are accounted for as a single lease element. The Company does not have any material finance leases.
Fixed lease expense payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time, and are often due to changes in an external market rate or the value of an index (e.g., Consumer Price Index). Certain of the Company’s operating lease agreements include variable payments that are passed through by the lessor, such as insurance, taxes, and common area maintenance, payments based on the usage of the asset, and rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Variable payments are expensed as incurred and included within variable lease costs.
The Company’s lease agreements do not contain material residual value guarantees, restrictions, or covenants.
(m) 
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we determine it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management judgment is required in determining the period in which the reversal of a valuation allowance should occur. The Company is required to consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, such as historical levels of income and future forecasts of taxable income among other items, in determining whether a full or partial release of its valuation allowance is required. The Company is also required to schedule future taxable income in accordance with accounting standards that address income taxes to assess the appropriateness of a valuation allowance, which further requires the exercise of significant management judgment. The Company’s accounting for deferred tax consequences represents the best estimate of those future events.
The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. When applicable, the Company records interest and penalties as an element of income tax expense.
Refer to Note 14 for additional information on income taxes.

Table of Contents
(n) 
Share Repurchases
The Company retires all shares repurchased pursuant to its approved share repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program"). The Company records the share purchase price and the amount of any excise taxes payable on shares repurchased as a reduction of Additional paid-in capital on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company exhausts Additional paid-in capital, it will record the excess as a reduction to Retained earnings. For more information on the Repurchase Program, refer to Note 15.
(o) 
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control of goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled to for those goods or services based on the following five steps:
1)
Identify the contract with a customer;
2)
Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
3)
Determine the transaction price;
4)
Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
5)
Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company derives its revenue from contracts substantially all from recurring service fees. While the majority of its agreements are generally cancellable by the client on 
60
 days’ notice or less, the Company offers term agreements to its clients, which are generally 
two years
 in length. Recurring fees are mostly derived from cloud-based payroll and HCM software solutions which includes payroll processing and related services such as payroll reporting and tax filing services, time and labor services, time clock rentals, and HR-related software solutions, including employee management and benefits enrollment and administration, substantially all of which are delivered on a monthly basis.
Substantially all of the Company’s recurring fees are satisfied over time as services are provided. The performance obligations related to recurring services are generally satisfied monthly as services are provided, with fees charged and collected based on a per-employee-per-month fee. The Company has certain optional performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time including the sales of time clocks and W-2 services.
Implementation services and other consist mainly of nonrefundable implementation fees, which involve setting the client up in, and loading data into, the Company’s cloud-based modules. These implementation activities are considered set-up activities. The Company has determined that the nonrefundable upfront fees provide certain clients with a material right to renew the contract. As a result, implementation fees are deferred and amortized generally over a period up to 
24
 months. 
Sales taxes collected from clients and remitted to governmental authorities where applicable are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
Interest income earned on funds held for clients is recognized in Interest income on funds held for clients when earned as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are components of providing services to clients.
(p) 
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs for ongoing client support and implementation activities and also includes amortization of capitalized internal-use software and certain acquired intangibles. The Company generally expenses these costs when incurred except for costs related to the implementation of the Company’s proprietary products. These costs are capitalized and amortized generally over a period of 
7
 years.

 for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.
(r) 
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes all employee stock-based compensation as a cost in the financial statements. Equity-classified awards, comprised of restricted stock units, performance stock units and market share units, are measured at the grant date fair value of each award and expense is recognized, net of assumed forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of each award. For market share units, the Company estimates grant date fair value using a discrete model based on multiple stock price-paths developed through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. For estimated shares purchasable under the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), the Company estimates grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and recognizes applicable expense on a straight-line basis over each purchase period. The Company may update the assumed forfeiture rates based on historical experience as appropriate.
(s) 
Commitments and Contingencies
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.
(t) 
Segment Information
The Company’s chief operating decision maker reviews the financial results of the Company in total when evaluating financial performance and for purposes of allocating resources. The Company has thus determined that it operates in a single reporting segment.
(u)
 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023-07"). ASU 2023-07 primarily requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker along with other incremental segment information. The Company adopted this ASU for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 and applied the guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Refer to Note 19 for the Company’s disclosures under this standard.
(v) 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosure ("ASU 2023-09"). ASU 2023-09 mostly requires, on an annual basis, disclosure of specific categories in an entity's effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The incremental disclosures may be presented on a prospective or retrospective basis. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact to its consolidated financial statement disclosures and the method of adopting this ASU. It will adopt this guidance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2026.
In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses ("ASU 2024-03"). ASU 2024-03 requires the disclosure of additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements. The incremental disclosures may be presented on a prospective or retrospective basis. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of this ASU on its consolidated financial statement disclosures including the method and timing of adoption.
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the 
F-14

impact of other recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

Deferred revenue
The timing of revenue recognition for recurring revenue is generally consistent with the timing of invoicing as they occur monthly as services are provided based on a per-employee-per-month fee. As such, the Company does not generally recognize contract assets or liabilities related to recurring revenue. 
The Company defers and amortizes nonrefundable upfront fees related to implementation services generally over a period up to 
24
 months based on the type of contract. 
The following table summarizes the changes in deferred revenue (i.e., contract liability) related to these nonrefundable upfront fees as follows:

(5) Fair Value Measurement
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:
•
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
•
Level 2—Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
•
Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
The Company measures any cash and cash equivalents, funds held for clients' cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and client fund obligations at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs. The Company considers the recorded value of these financial assets and liabilities to approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities at June 30, 2024 and 2025 based upon the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.
Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs obtained from an independent pricing service. Available-for-sale securities include commercial paper, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, U.S. treasury securities and other. The independent pricing service utilizes a variety of inputs including benchmark yields, broker/dealer quoted prices, reported trades, issuer spreads as well as other available market data. The Company, on a sample basis, validates the pricing from the independent pricing service against another third-party pricing source for reasonableness. The Company has not adjusted any prices obtained by the independent pricing service, as it believes they are appropriately valued. There were 
no
 available-for-sale securities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at June 30, 2024 or 2025.

Table of Contents
On November 30, 2023, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of TraceHQ.com, Inc. ("Trace") through a merger of Trace with a subsidiary of the Company for cash consideration of $
12,086
, subject to working capital and other customary purchase price adjustments. Trace offers a headcount planning solution that expands the Company's product functionality in this area. The allocation of the purchase price for Trace was approximately $
6,809
 of goodwill, $
4,200
 of proprietary technology and other immaterial assets and liabilities, which reflects certain immaterial measurement period adjustments recorded during the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2025. Pro forma information is not presented for the Trace acquisition because the effects of the acquisition are not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
On October 1, 2024, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Airbase Inc. ("Airbase") for cash consideration of $
320,205
, net of cash acquired and preliminary purchase price adjustments, which was funded by borrowings under its credit facility. Refer to Note 12 for more information on the credit facility. Airbase is a modern finance and spend management software solution that combines bill pay/accounts payable automation, expense management, corporate cards and procurement capabilities. The acquisition was consummated to enable the Company to provide a comprehensive solution and modern client experience for managing payroll and non-payroll spend on a single integrated platform. The measurement period will end no later than one year from the acquisition date. The primary area subject to change is deferred taxes.
The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for Airbase was as follows, which reflects certain immaterial measurement period adjustments recorded during the year ended June 30, 2025:

The Company’s fair value estimate of the acquired proprietary technology is based on a relief from royalty rate methodology which includes but is not limited to, forecasted revenue growth rates, royalty rates, technology migration rates and required rate of return.  
The results from both of these acquisitions have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements since the closing of the respective acquisitions. The goodwill related to both of these transactions is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and growth opportunities from the expansion and enhancement of the Company’s product offerings. The goodwill associated with both of these acquisitions is not deductible for income tax purposes. Direct costs related to these acquisitions were not material and were expensed as incurred primarily as General and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
The unaudited pro forma information below summarizes the combined results of the Company and Airbase as if the Company’s acquisition of Airbase closed on July 1, 2023, but does not necessarily reflect the combined actual results of operations of the Company and Airbase that would have been achieved, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations. 
The unaudited pro forma information reflects certain adjustments that were directly attributable to the acquisition of Airbase, including amortization of acquired intangible assets, interest expense incurred to fund the acquisition and acquisition related costs.

F-22
Table of Contents
The proceeds of any borrowings are to be used to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and permitted acquisitions, investments, and distributions. The Company may generally borrow, prepay and reborrow under the credit facility and terminate or reduce the lenders’ commitments at any time prior to revolving credit facility expiration without a premium or a penalty, other than customary “breakage” costs. 
Any borrowings under the credit facility will generally bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate per annum determined by reference to either the Term SOFR rate plus the SOFR Adjustment or an adjusted base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin ranging from 
0.875
% to 
1.500
% and 
0.00
% to 
0.500
%, respectively, based on the then-applicable net total leverage ratio. Additionally, the Company is required to pay certain commitment, letter of credit fronting and letter of credit participation fees on available and/or undrawn portions of the credit facility.
The Company is required to comply with certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a requirement to maintain a maximum net total leverage ratio of not greater than 
4.00
 to 1.00, (with a step up to 
4.50
 to 1.00 for the 4 consecutive fiscal quarters following a fiscal quarter in which certain permitted acquisitions are consummated), and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 
2.00
 to 1.00. As of June 30, 2025, the Company was in compliance with all of the aforementioned covenants.
(13) Leases
The Company primarily leases office space under non-cancellable operating leases expiring on various dates from March 2026 through October 2032. The leases provide for increasing annual base rents and oblige the Company to fund its proportionate share of operating expenses and, in certain cases, real estate taxes. The Company also leases various types of office and production related equipment under non-cancellable operating leases expiring on various dates from June 2026 through September 2028.

Table of Contents
As of June 30, 2025, the Company maintains a valuation allowance of $
232
 for certain state tax benefits which may not be realized. The increase to the valuation allowance is mainly due to the acquisition of certain Airbase Inc. state tax net operating loss carryforwards. Such assessment may change in the future as further evidence becomes available.
At June 30, 2025, the Company has gross net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $
56,746
, all of which can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has gross net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately $
125,204
, of which $
111,008
 expire from 2030 to 2045, while the remaining $
14,196
 can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company also has gross state research and development tax credits and other state credit carryforwards of approximately $
20,501
, which expire between 2026 and 2045. 
As of June 30, 2024 and 2025, the Company’s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which would impact the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized, are presented below. The Company will include applicable penalties and interest when the benefit is recognized:

The Company files income tax returns with the United States federal government and various state jurisdictions. Certain tax years remain open for federal and state tax reporting jurisdictions in which the Company does business due to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from such years or utilized in a period remaining open for audit under normal statute of limitations relating to income tax liabilities. The Company, including its domestic subsidiaries, files a consolidated federal income tax return. For years before fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examination; however, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has the ability to review years prior to fiscal year 2022 to the extent the Company utilized tax attributes carried forward from those prior years. The statute of limitations on state filings is generally 
three
 to 
four years
. 
On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “Act”) was enacted into law. The Act includes changes to U.S. income tax law that will be applicable to the Company beginning in fiscal 2026. The Act includes significant provisions such as accelerated tax deductions for qualified property and research expenditures. While the Company is still assessing the effects of these provisions, it is expected to mostly impact the Company’s consolidated balance sheet with material impacts to deferred tax assets and liabilities and income taxes payable in fiscal 2026.

(15) Stockholders’ Equity
Common Stock
Holders of common stock are entitled to 
one
 vote per share and to receive dividends, when declared. The holders have no preemptive or other subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions with respect to such shares.
Share Repurchase Program

The Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time. During the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, the Company repurchased 
1,050
 and 
787
 shares, respectively, for $
150,000

F-29
Table of Contents
Additionally, from time to time, the Company is subject to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Many of these matters are covered in whole or in part by insurance. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the ultimate disposition of any matters currently outstanding or threatened will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and could materially impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity based on the final disposition of these matters.

(18) Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, the release of restricted stock units and market share units and the shares purchasable via the employee stock purchase plan as of the balance sheet date.
