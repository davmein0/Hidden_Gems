These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this report in Part I, Item 1A — “Risk Factors,” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of their date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “we,” “our,” “us,” “Xenon,” and “the Company” refer to Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc. and its subsidiary. Unless otherwise noted, all dollar amounts in this report are expressed in United States dollars.

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and although we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted a thorough inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.

This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes our trademarks and registered trademarks, including the Xenon logo and other trademarks or service marks of Xenon. Other trademarks, trade names or service marks appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K belong to their respective holders.

Risk Factors Summary

Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors.” The following is a summary of the principal risks we face:

•
We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.

•
We will need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product discovery and development programs or commercialization efforts or other operations.

•
Our business substantially depends upon the successful development of azetukalner. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize, azetukalner, our business may be materially harmed.

•
Clinical trials may fail to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of our, or our collaborators’, product candidates at any stage of clinical development. Terminating the development of any of our, or our collaborators’, product candidates could materially harm our business and the market price of our common shares.

•
We, or our collaborators, may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials which could delay or prevent the successful completion of clinical trials of our product candidates.

•
We, or our collaborators, may incur unexpected costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our, or our collaborators’, product candidates.

•
The regulatory approval processes of the FDA, EMA and regulators in other foreign jurisdictions are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we, or our collaborators, are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all, our business may be substantially harmed.

•
If we are unable to establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements for these purposes, we may not be successful in independently commercializing any future products.

•
Our prospects for successful development and commercialization of our partnered products and product candidates are dependent upon the research, development and marketing efforts of our collaborators.

•
Our reliance on third parties to manufacture our product candidates may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates, raw materials, APIs or drug products when needed or at an acceptable cost.

•
We rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, including to comply with applicable laws and regulations or meet expected deadlines, our business could be substantially harmed.

•
We could be unsuccessful in obtaining or maintaining adequate patent protection for one or more of our products, product candidates or future products.

•
We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.

2

•
Our business and operations could suffer in the event of an actual or perceived information security incident such as a cybersecurity breach, system failure or other compromise of our systems and/or information, including information held by a third-party contractor or vendor.

•
The market price of our common shares may be volatile, and purchasers of our common shares could incur substantial losses.

•
Future sales and issuances of our common shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common shares would cause our shareholders to incur dilution and could cause the market price of our common shares to fall.

Our Risk Factors are not guarantees that no such conditions exist as of the date of this report and should not be interpreted as an affirmative statement that such risks or conditions have not materialized, in whole or in part.
