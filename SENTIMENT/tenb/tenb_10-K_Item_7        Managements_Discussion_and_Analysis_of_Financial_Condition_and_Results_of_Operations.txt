Overview
We are a leading provider of exposure management solutions. Exposure management 
i
s the evolution of vulnerability management, advancing risk assessment and prioritization across the entire attack surface – from IT infrastructure to cloud environments to critical infrastructure. Tenable unifies security visibility, insight and action across this attack surface, equipping modern organizations to expose and close the cybersecurity gaps that erode business value, reputation and trust.
Tenable One is an AI-powered exposure management platform that gives enterprises a single, unified view of risk across all types of assets and attack pathways. The platform combines broad, industry-leading vulnerability coverage, spanning IT assets, cloud resources, containers, web apps and identity systems. Tenable One builds on the speed and breadth of vulnerability coverage from our research team of cybersecurity and data science experts, or Tenable Research, and adds aggregated exposure view analytics, guidance on mitigating attack pathways and a centralized asset inventory. It leverages AI, and machine learning, or ML, rapidly analyzing and interpreting vast data sets to pinpoint priority weaknesses and high-risk attack paths, deliver recommendations and automate routine tasks.
Tenable One integrates Tenable Vulnerability Management, Tenable Cloud Security, Tenable Identity Exposure, Tenable Web App Scanning, Tenable Lumin Exposure View, Tenable Attack Surface Management, Tenable Security Center and Tenable OT Security. Our products, including Nessus are also offered on a standalone basis.
Our platform offerings are primarily sold on a subscription basis with a one-year term. Our subscription terms are generally not longer than three years. These offerings are typically prepaid in advance. 
We sell and market our products and services through our field sales force that works closely with our channel network of distributors, resellers and managed security service providers (MSSPs), in developing sales opportunities. We typically use a two-tiered channel model whereby we sell our enterprise platform offerings to our distributors, who in turn sell to our resellers, who then sell to end users, who we call customers.

Recurring revenue, which includes revenue from subscription arrangements for software (both recognized ratably over the subscription term and upon delivery) and cloud-based solutions and maintenance associated with perpetual licenses, represented 96% of revenue in 2024 and 95% of revenue in 2023 and 2022.
Key Operating and Financial Metrics
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use and monitor the following operating and financial metrics, which include non-GAAP financial measures, to understand and evaluate our core operating and financial performance. 
Calculated Current Billings

We use the non-GAAP measure of calculated current billings, which we believe is a key metric to measure our periodic performance. Given that most of our customers pay in advance, we typically recognize a majority of the related revenue ratably over time. We use calculated current billings to measure and monitor our ability to provide our business with the working capital generated by upfront payments from our customers. 
Calculated current billings consists of revenue recognized in a period plus the change in current deferred revenue in the corresponding period. We believe that calculated current billings, which excludes deferred revenue for periods beyond twelve months in a customer’s contractual term, more closely correlates with annual contract value. Variability in total billings, depending on the timing of large multi-year contracts and the preference for annual billing versus multi-year upfront billing, may distort growth in one period over another.
Calculated current billings may vary from period-to-period for a number of reasons, and therefore has a number of limitations as a quarter-to-quarter or year-over-year comparative measure. Calculated current billings in any one period may be impacted by the timing and amount of new sales transactions, the timing and amount of renewal transactions, including early renewals, the mix of the amount of subscriptions and perpetual licenses and the timing of billing professional services, as well as the timing and amount of multi-year prepaid contracts, all of which could favorably or unfavorably impact quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year comparisons. For example, an increasing number of large sales transactions, for which the timing has and will continue to vary, may occur in quarters subsequent to or in advance of those that we anticipate. Additionally, our calculation of calculated current billings may be different from other companies that report similar financial measures. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider calculated current billings along with revenue and our other GAAP financial results.

Free Cash Flow
We use the non-GAAP measure of free cash flow, which we define as GAAP net cash flows from operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash (if any) that is available, after purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs, for investment in our business and to make acquisitions. We believe that free cash flow is useful as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate cash. 
Our use of free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results under GAAP. First, free cash flow is not a substitute for net cash flows from operating activities. Second, other companies may calculate free cash flow or similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison. Additionally, the utility of free cash flow is further limited as it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider free cash flow along with net cash provided by operating activities and our other GAAP financial measures.

Customer Metrics
We believe that our customer base provides a significant opportunity to expand sales of our enterprise platform offerings. We define an enterprise platform customer as a customer that has licensed Tenable One, Tenable Vulnerability Management, Tenable Cloud Security, Tenable Identity Exposure, Tenable OT Security or Tenable Security Center for an annual amount of $5,000 or greater. New enterprise platform customers represent new customer logos during the periods presented and do not include customer conversions from Tenable Nessus Expert to enterprise platforms.

Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate
Our dollar-based net expansion rate reflects both our customer retention and ability to drive additional sales to our existing customers. Our dollar-based net expansion rate has historically fluctuated and is expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including existing customers' satisfaction with our solutions, existing customer retention, the pricing of our solutions, the availability of competing solutions and the pricing thereof, and the timing of customer renewals. In addition, our sales pipeline opportunities vary from quarter to quarter between new customers and expansion from existing customers, and we do not prioritize one over the other to maximize the dollar-based net expansion rate. 
Our dollar-based net expansion rate is evaluated on a last twelve months, or LTM, basis, and is calculated as follows:
•
Denominator: To calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate as of the end of a reporting period, we first determine the annual recurring revenue, or ARR, from all active subscriptions (both revenue recognized ratably over the subscription term and upon delivery) and maintenance from perpetual licenses as of the last day of the same reporting period in the prior year. This represents recurring payments that we expect to receive in the next 12-month period from the cohort of customers that existed on the last day of the same reporting period in the prior year.
•
Numerator: We measure the ARR for that same cohort of customers representing all subscriptions and maintenance from perpetual licenses based on customer orders as of the end of the reporting period.
We calculate dollar-based net expansion rate by dividing the numerator by the denominator. 
The following table presents our dollar-based net expansion rate:

Non-GAAP Income from Operations and Non-GAAP Operating Margin

We use non-GAAP income from operations along with non-GAAP operating margin as key indicators of our financial performance. We define these non-GAAP financial measures as their respective GAAP measures, excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring expenses, costs related to the intra-entity asset transfers resulting from the internal restructuring of legal entities and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Acquisition-related expenses include transaction and integration expenses, as well as costs related to the intercompany transfer of acquired intellectual property. Restructuring expenses include non-ordinary course severance, employee related benefits and other charges to reorganize business operations.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our core operating results over multiple periods. There are a number of limitations related to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures as compared to GAAP loss from operations and operating margin, including that non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP operating margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. 
The following table presents a reconciliation of loss from operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to non-GAAP income from operations, and operating margin, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to non-GAAP operating margin:

Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share
We use non-GAAP net income, which excludes stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as the related tax impacts, and the tax impact and related costs of intra-entity asset transfers resulting from the internal restructuring of legal entities as well as deferred income tax benefits recognized in connection with acquisitions, to calculate non-GAAP earnings per share. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide important information because they facilitate comparisons of our core operating results over multiple periods.

Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue 
We generate revenue from subscription arrangements for our software and cloud-based solutions, perpetual licenses, maintenance associated with perpetual licenses and professional services. We begin to recognize revenue when control of our software or services is transferred to the customer, which for sales made through our channel network is typically concurrent with the transfer to the end user.
Our subscription arrangements generally have annual or multi-year contractual terms to use our software or cloud-based solutions, including ongoing software updates during the contractual period. For software subscriptions that are dependent on ongoing software updates and the ability to identify the latest cybersecurity vulnerabilities, revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term given the critical utility provided by the ongoing updates that are released through the contract period. When the critical utility of our software does not depend on ongoing updates, we recognize revenue attributable to the license at the time of delivery and the revenue attributable to the maintenance and support ratably over the contract period.
Our perpetual licenses are generally sold with one or more years of maintenance that include ongoing software updates to identify the latest cybersecurity vulnerabilities, which provide critical utility to the software. We recognize perpetual license revenue over a five-year estimated economic life of the expected customer contract. 
Professional services and other revenue is primarily comprised of advisory services and training related to the deployment and optimization of our products. These services do not result in significant customization of our products. Professional services and other revenue is recognized as the services are performed.
We have historically experienced, and expect in the future to experience, seasonality in entering into agreements with customers. We typically enter into a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the third and fourth quarters of the year. The increase in customer agreements in the third quarter is primarily attributable to U.S. government and related agencies, and the increase in the fourth quarter is primarily attributable to large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry. The ratable nature of our subscription revenue makes this seasonality less apparent in our overall financial results. We expect longer purchasing and approval phases of our sales cycle to continue in 2025.
Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Cost of revenue includes personnel costs related to our technical support group that provides assistance to customers, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes, stock-based compensation and any ordinary course severance. Cost of revenue also includes cloud infrastructure costs, the costs related to professional services and training, depreciation, amortization of acquired and developed technology, hardware costs and allocated overhead costs, which consist of information technology, facilities and insurance. 
We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our cloud-based platform and customer support team as we grow our business. The level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future.
Gross profit, or revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, have been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the timing of our acquisition of new customers and our renewals of and follow-on sales to existing customers, the costs associated with operating our cloud-based platform, the extent to which we expand our customer support team and the extent to which we can increase the efficiency of our technology and infrastructure through technological improvements. 
We expect our gross profit to increase in absolute dollars but our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of all of these factors, particularly as it relates to cloud infrastructure costs, as we expect revenue from our cloud-based subscriptions to increase as a percentage of revenue.

Table of Contents
Operating Expenses 
Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative and restructuring expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes, stock-based compensation and ordinary course severance. Operating expenses also include depreciation and amortization as well as allocated overhead costs, including IT and facilities costs.
Sales and Marketing 
Sales and marketing expense consists of personnel costs, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel and entertainment, expenses for conferences, meetings and events and allocated overhead costs. We capitalize sales commissions, including related fringe benefit costs, and recognize the expense over an estimated period of benefit, which ranges between three and four years for subscription arrangements and five years for perpetual license arrangements. Sales commissions on contract renewals are capitalized and amortized ratably over the contract term, with the exception of contracts with renewal periods that are one year or less, in which case the incremental costs are expensed as incurred. Sales commissions on professional services arrangements are expensed as incurred as the contractual periods of these arrangements are generally less than one year.
We intend to continue to make investments in our sales and marketing teams to increase revenue, further penetrate the market and expand our global customer base. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars annually and to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future. However, as our revenue increases, we expect our sales and marketing expense to decrease as a percentage of our revenue in 2025 and over the long term. Our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses, including sales commissions, which may fluctuate depending on the mix of sales and related expense recognition. 
Research and Development 
Research and development expense consists of personnel costs, software used to develop our products, travel and entertainment, consulting and professional fees for third-party development resources as well as allocated overhead. Our research and development expense supports our efforts to continue to add capabilities to our existing products and enable the continued detection of new network vulnerabilities. 
We expect our research and development expense to continue to increase annually in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development efforts to enhance the functionality of our cloud-based platform. However, we expect our research and development expense to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our research and development expense may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses.
General and Administrative 
General and administrative expense consists of personnel costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and administrative departments. Additional expenses include travel and entertainment, professional fees, insurance, allocated overhead and acquisition-related expenses. 
We expect our general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses. We expect general and administrative expenses in Q1 2025 to increase sequentially, primarily due to termination benefits, including cash compensation and accelerated equity award vesting, related to the passing of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
56
Table of Contents
Restructuring 
Restructuring expenses consist of non-ordinary course severance, employee related benefits and other charges to reorganize business operations.
Interest Income, Interest Expense and Other Expense, Net
Interest income consists of income earned on cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense in connection with our Term Loan, unused commitment fees on our senior secured revolving credit facility, or Revolving Credit Facility, and letter of credit fees. Other expense, net consists primarily of foreign currency remeasurement and transaction gains and losses and any realized and unrealized gains and losses, including impairment losses and gains related to our non-marketable investments.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes consists of income taxes in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business and the related withholding taxes on sales with customers. We have recorded deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance has been provided, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future as it is more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets may not be realized based on our history of losses.

Comparison of 2023 and 2022 
For a discussion of our consolidated results for 2023 compared to 2022, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2024, we had $328.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, which consisted of bank deposits and money market funds, and $248.5 million of short-term investments, which consisted of commercial paper, asset backed securities, U.S. Treasury and agency obligations and corporate and Yankee bonds. 
Since our inception, we have primarily financed our operations through cash provided by operations, including payments received from customers using our software products and services. Prior to our IPO, we did not raise any primary institutional capital, and the proceeds of our Series A and Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock financings were used to repurchase shares of capital stock from former stockholders. We have generated significant operating losses as reflected by our accumulated deficit of $861.3 million at December 31, 2024. 
We typically invoice our customers annually in advance and, to a lesser extent, multi-years in advance. Therefore, a substantial source of our cash is from such prepayments, which are included in deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue consists primarily of the unearned portion of billed fees for our subscriptions and perpetual licenses, which is subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. At December 31, 2024, we had deferred revenue of $833.2 million, of which $650.4 million was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
Our principal uses of cash in recent periods have been funding our operations, expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development activities, investments in infrastructure, acquiring complementary businesses and technology and repurchasing shares of our common stock. We paid $29.2 million, $243.3 million and $66.8 million to acquire businesses in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In February 2025, we acquired Vulcan Cyber Ltd., or Vulcan Cyber, for approximately $148 million in cash and $2 million of restricted stock units (RSUs) that vest over a future period. We expect to enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights, in the future. 
We expect to continue incurring operating losses in the near term. Even though we generated positive cash flows from operations and free cash flow in 2024, 2023 and 2022, we may not be able to sustain these cash flows. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of spending to support further infrastructure and research and development efforts, the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in new and existing office spaces, the expansion of sales and marketing and international operating activities, any acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies, the timing of our introduction of new product capabilities and enhancements of our platform and the continuing market acceptance of our platform. It may be necessary to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund our operating and capital needs. In the event that financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional 
61

capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.
Stock Repurchase Plan
In November 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our common stock. In October 2024, our Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization by $200 million. Since the inception of the repurchase program and through December 31, 2024, we have purchased a total of 2.7 million shares for $114.9 million.
Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility

In July 2021, we entered into a credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, which is comprised of a $375.0 million Term Loan and a $50.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, with a $15.0 million letter of credit sublimit. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 2.75% per annum over SOFR, subject to a 0.50% floor, plus a credit spread adjustment depending on the interest period. 
From January to December 2024, interest rates on our Term Loan have been between 7.44% and 8.22%. The Term Loan is being amortized at 1% per annum in equal quarterly installments until the final payment of $350.6 million on the July 7, 2028 maturity date. We may be subject to mandatory Term Loan prepayments related to the excess cash provisions in the Credit Agreement if our first lien net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) exceeds 3.5. At December 31, 2024, our first lien net leverage ratio was 0.86. 
The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate, depending on first lien net leverage, ranging from 2.00% to 2.50% over SOFR and matures on July 7, 2026. We pay a commitment fee during the term ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% per annum of the average daily undrawn portion of our Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants and had $0.2 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Operating Activities
Our largest source of cash provided by operating activities is cash collections from sales of our products and services, as we typically invoice our customers in advance. Our primary uses of cash are employee compensation costs, third-party cloud infrastructure and other software subscription costs, demand generation expenditures and general corporate costs.
Investing Activities
From 2023 to 2024, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $171.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $214.1 million, a $3.5 million increase in proceeds from our investments in private companies and a $0.6 million decrease in capitalized software development costs, partially offset by a $43.3 million net decrease in sales of short-term investments, a $2.5 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, and a $1.3 million increase in cash paid for other investments.

Table of Contents
From 2022 to 2023, net cash used in investing activities increased by $84.6 million, primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $176.5 million, partially offset by a $71.6 million net increase in sales of short-term investments, $10.0 million in cash paid for other investments in 2022, a $7.7 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment and a $2.7 million decrease in capitalized software development costs.
Financing Activities
From 2023 to 2024, net cash used in financing activities increased by $80.7 million, primarily due to an $85.0 million increase in the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program partially offset by a $4.6 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
From 2022 to 2023, net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $22.1 million, primarily due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program of $14.9 million and an $8.2 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in proceeds from stock issued in connection with our employee stock purchase program. 
Contractual Obligations
We have certain contractual obligations for future payments. See 
Note 7
 to our consolidated financial statements for our required operating lease payments and 
Note 9
 for our required payments to Microsoft and AWS for cloud services.
At December 31, 2024, we had other non-cancellable purchase obligations of $24.5 million due in the next twelve months and $10.5 million due thereafter. Additionally, we had $8.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits and $1.4 million of asset retirement obligations, the timing of payments for which is uncertain.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In recognizing revenue, we apply the following steps:
•
Identify the contract with a customer
•
Identify the performance obligations in the contract
•
Determine the transaction price
•
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
•
Recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied
In situations where we enter into a contractual arrangement that includes non-standard terms and conditions, such as acceptance provisions and options to purchase additional products and services, as well as contract modifications, we apply judgment in identifying and assessing the impact on revenue recognition. 
We generate revenue from subscription arrangements for our software and cloud-based solutions, perpetual licenses, maintenance associated with perpetual licenses and professional services and other revenue.
63
Table of Contents
Subscription Revenue
Our subscription arrangements generally have annual or multi-year contractual terms and allow customers to use our software or cloud solutions. For our software subscriptions that are dependent on ongoing software updates and the ability to identify the latest cybersecurity vulnerabilities, revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term given the critical utility provided by the ongoing updates that are released throughout the contract period. When the critical utility of our software does not depend on ongoing updates, we recognize revenue attributable to the license at the time of delivery and the revenue attributable to the maintenance and support ratably over the contract period.
Perpetual License and Maintenance Revenue
Our perpetual licenses are generally sold with one or more years of maintenance that include ongoing software updates to identify the latest cybersecurity vulnerabilities, which provide critical utility to the software. We recognize perpetual license revenue over a five-year estimated economic life of the expected customer contract. 
We have estimated the five-year economic life of perpetual license contracts based on historical contract attrition, expected renewal periods, the lifecycle of the our technology and other factors. While we believe that the estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could impact our financial results.
Professional Services and Other Revenue
Professional services and other revenue is primarily comprised of advisory services and training related to the deployment and optimization of our products. These services do not result in significant customization of our products. Professional services and other revenue is recognized as the services are performed.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
In cases where our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, the contract transaction price is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis. We typically determine standalone selling price based on observable selling prices of our products and services.
Variable Consideration
We record revenue from sales at the net sales price, which is the transaction price, including estimates of variable consideration when applicable. Certain of our customers may be entitled to receive credits and in certain circumstances, refunds, if service level commitments are not met. We have not historically experienced significant incidents affecting the ability to meet these service level commitments and any estimated refunds related to these agreements have not been material.
Sales through our channel partner network of distributors and resellers are generally discounted as compared to the price that we would sell to an end user. Revenue for sales through our channel network, which is fixed, is recorded net of any distributor or reseller margin.
Deferred Commissions
Sales commissions, including related incremental fringe benefit costs, are considered to be incremental costs of obtaining a contract, and therefore are deferred over an estimated period of benefit, which ranges between three and four years for subscription arrangements and five years for perpetual license arrangements. We have estimated the period of benefit based on the expected contract term including renewal periods, the lifecycle of our technology and other factors. Sales commissions on contract renewals are capitalized and amortized ratably over the contract term, with the exception of contracts with renewal periods that are one year or less, in which case the incremental costs are expensed as incurred. While we believe that the estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.

Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and purchase rights issued under our 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2018 ESPP, is calculated based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally two to four years. Our performance stock units, or PSUs, vest over a period of 4 years and are subject to defined performance and service conditions. Our PSUs and RSUs that include performance-based vesting conditions are expensed using the accelerated attribution method. We account for forfeitures as they occur.
The fair value of our RSUs, PSUs and restricted stock is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Estimating the fair value of purchase rights under the 2018 ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires assumptions as to the fair value of our underlying common stock, the estimated term of the option, the risk free interest rates, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock and the expected dividend yield. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the option awards reflect our best estimates. If any of the assumptions change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ significantly compared with the awards granted previously.
The assumptions and estimates are as follows:
•
Fair Value of Common Stock. 
See Valuations below.
•
Expected Term.
 We use the actual purchase periods as the expected term in the 2018 ESPP.
•
Volatility.
 This is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable, such as a share price, has fluctuated (historical volatility) or is expected to fluctuate (expected volatility) during a period. We use the volatility of our common stock to calculate expected volatility for the 2018 ESPP.
•
Risk-Free Interest Rate.
 This is the U.S. Treasury rate, having a term that most closely resembles the expected remaining term of each offering of the 2018 ESPP.
•
Dividend Yield
. We have not and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock.
Valuations
We use the market price of our common stock at the date of grant as the fair value. 
The fair value of the 2018 ESPP purchase rights were estimated on the offering or modification dates based on the following assumptions:

Business Combinations
We account for business combinations by recognizing the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The excess purchase consideration over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, a non-recurring Level 3 fair value measurement, we make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets such as identified acquired technology and trade names. We generally determine the fair value of acquired technology using the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach. However, in certain situations we may use the cost approach. Estimates in valuing identifiable intangible assets include, but are not limited to, projected revenue growth rates, obsolescence projections and an appropriate discount rate. Our estimate of fair value is based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, we may make adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with offsetting adjustments to goodwill. 
65
Table of Contents
Any adjustments made after the measurement period will be reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill
The excess purchase consideration over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. We perform our annual impairment assessment on October 1, or more frequently, when events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. We operate as one reporting unit and have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company as a whole is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment includes an evaluation of relevant events and circumstances, including macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, our overall financial performance, and trends in the value of our common stock. During the periods presented, there were no indications of impairment and it was not more likely than not that goodwill was impaired.
Income Taxes
We are subject to federal, state and local taxes in the United States as well as numerous international jurisdictions. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than the United States. Earnings generated by our international entities are related to transfer pricing requirements as applicable under local jurisdiction tax laws.
We record a provision for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. We have elected to treat taxes related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income, or GILTI, as a period cost. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have valuation allowances in all jurisdictions against deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities that will reverse and provide a source of taxable income. Our evaluation of valuation allowances could change in the future and the impact could have a material impact on our financial statements.
We recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. Interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions are classified as a component of income tax expense.
Depending on the jurisdiction, distributions of earnings could be subject to withholding taxes at rates applicable to the distributing jurisdiction. As we intend to continue to reinvest the earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely, we have not provided for a U.S. income tax liability and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

 to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.
Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange and inflation risks. 
Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2024, we had $328.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, which consisted of cash deposits and money market funds. We also had $248.5 million of short-term investments, which consisted of commercial paper, asset backed securities, U.S. treasury and agency securities and corporate and Yankee bonds. Our investments are carried at 
66
Table of Contents
their fair market values with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income within stockholders' equity. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs and the fiduciary control of cash and investments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk; however, a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our financial statements. 
In July 2021, we entered into the Credit Agreement comprised of a $375.0 million Term Loan and a $50.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. From January to December 2024, interest rates on our Term Loan have been between 7.44% and 8.22%. In February 2025, our Term Loan had an interest rate of 7.18%. A one percentage point increase in the rate would not have had a material impact on our financial statements.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
Substantially all of our sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, with a limited number of contracts denominated in foreign currencies, including foreign denominated leases. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States, denominated in foreign currencies and subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound, Australian dollar, Israeli New Shekel, Indian Rupee and Brazilian Real. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies could result in lower international sales as our products would seem more expensive and could result in lower international operating costs as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of our international subsidiaries. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize remeasurement and transaction gains (losses) in our consolidated statements of operations. As the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has not been material to our historical operating results, we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currencies becomes more significant. 
Inflation Risk

While we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition through December 31, 2024, our costs, specifically employee-related and third-party cloud infrastructure costs, may become subject to significant inflationary pressures, and our inability or failure to fully offset such higher costs could harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Tenable Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tenable Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition – Identification and Evaluation of Contracts with Non-Standard Terms and Conditions
Description of the Matter
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, management enters into certain contracts with customers with non-standard terms and conditions.
Performing procedures relating to the identification and evaluation of non-standard terms and conditions in contracts is a critical audit matter because there is a significant amount of judgment required by management in identifying and evaluating non-standard terms and conditions and determining the impact of such terms and conditions on the amount and timing of revenue recognition. Accordingly, there is significant auditor judgment and significant audit effort in performing our audit procedures to evaluate whether non-standard terms and conditions in contracts were appropriately identified and evaluated by management.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process for identifying and evaluating contracts with non-standard terms and conditions. These procedures also included, among others, on a sample basis (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of management’s identification of contracts with non-standard terms and conditions and (ii) testing management’s determination of the impact of non-standard terms and conditions on the amount and timing of revenue recognition.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Tenable Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Tenable Holdings, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Tenable Holdings, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. 
Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Business Description
Tenable Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” "us," or “our”) is a provider of exposure management solutions. Exposure management 
i
s the evolution of vulnerability management, advancing risk assessment and prioritization across the entire attack surface – from IT infrastructure to cloud environments to critical infrastructure. We unify security visibility, insight and action across this attack surface, equipping modern organizations to expose and close the cybersecurity gaps that erode business value, reputation and trust.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tenable Holdings, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).

All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates include, but are not limited to, the determination of the estimated economic life of perpetual licenses for revenue recognition, the estimated period of benefit for deferred commissions, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair value of acquired intangible assets, the valuation of stock-based compensation, the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases and the valuation of deferred tax assets and investments. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
Foreign Currency
The functional currency for all of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. We bill our customers in U.S. dollars. Expenses incurred in non U.S. dollar currencies are remeasured into U.S. dollars when incurred. Remeasurement losses in currencies other than the functional currency were $
5.0
 million, $
3.1
 million and $
4.8
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included as a component of other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue in order to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this, we apply the following steps:
•
Identify the contract with a customer
•
Identify the performance obligations in the contract
•
Determine the transaction price
•
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
•
Recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied
In situations where we enter into a contractual arrangement that includes non-standard terms and conditions, such as acceptance provisions or options to purchase additional products and services, as well as contract modifications, we apply judgment in identifying and assessing the impact on revenue recognition. 
77
Table of Contents
We generate revenue from subscription arrangements for software and cloud-based solutions, perpetual licenses, maintenance associated with perpetual licenses, and professional services and other revenue. We begin to recognize revenue when control of our software or services is transferred to the customer, which for sales made through distributors is concurrent with the transfer to the end user.
Subscription Revenue

Subscription arrangements generally have annual or multi-year contractual terms and allow customers to use our software or cloud solutions. For our software subscriptions that are dependent on ongoing software updates and the ability to identify the latest cybersecurity vulnerabilities, revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term given the critical utility provided by the ongoing updates that are released throughout the contract period. When the critical utility of our software does not depend on ongoing updates, we recognize revenue attributable to the license at the time of delivery and the revenue attributable to the maintenance and support ratably over the contract period.
Perpetual License and Maintenance Revenue 
Our perpetual licenses are generally sold with 
one
 or more years of maintenance that include ongoing software updates to identify the latest cybersecurity vulnerabilities, which provide critical utility to the software. We recognize perpetual license revenue over a 
five-year
 estimated economic life of the expected customer contract.
Professional Services and Other Revenue

Professional services and other revenue is primarily comprised of advisory services and training related to the deployment and optimization of our products. These services do not result in significant customization of our products. Professional services and other revenue is recognized as the services are performed. 
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations

In cases where our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, the contract transaction price is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis. We typically determine standalone selling price based on observable selling prices of our products and services. 
Variable Consideration 
We record revenue from sales at the net sales price, which is the transaction price, including estimates of variable consideration when applicable. Certain of our customers may be entitled to receive credits and in limited circumstances, refunds, if service level commitments are not met. We have not historically experienced significant incidents affecting the ability to meet these service level commitments and any estimated refunds related to these agreements have not been material. 
Sales through our channel network of distributors and resellers are generally discounted as compared to the price that we would sell to an end user. Revenue for sales through our channel network is recorded net of any distributor or reseller margin.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash and cash equivalents included $
8.2
 million and $
5.8
 million, respectively, of restricted cash related to collateral for outstanding letters of credit and an operating lease.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
78
Table of Contents
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We measure cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at fair value using a fair value hierarchy of inputs. We approximate fair value by using the carrying amounts for accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses due to their short-term nature.
Investments
Short-term Investments
Our short-term investments include asset backed securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate and Yankee bonds, and U.S. treasury and agency obligations. Our investments are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity.
We classify investments with original maturities of less than 90 days as cash and cash equivalents. Investments with original maturities greater than 90 days, including those we do not currently intend on selling within the next twelve months, are classified as short-term investments as they are available for use in our operations. 
We evaluate potential impairments of available-for-sale debt securities due to credit-related and non-credit-related factors, including market risk, and if it is more-likely-than-not that we would have to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis. Identified credit-related impairments would be recognized as a charge in the statement of operations.
Other Investments
Our investments in privately held companies consist of preferred stock, convertible notes and non-marketable simple agreements for future equity ("SAFE") investments. We have elected to apply the measurement alternative and record these other investments at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus observable price changes for similar investments of the same issuer. Gains or losses on other investments are recognized in other expense, net on our consolidated statements of operations. Other investments are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, less an allowance for doubtful accounts, and do not bear interest. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment of the receivables. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our receivables and assess the allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific customer collection issues and historical write-off trends.
Our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of expected future credit losses. We consider various factors that may impact our ability to collect on accounts receivable, including our historical collection experience, age of accounts receivable balances, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, as well as other factors, however, these estimates may change and future credit losses may differ from our estimates. Expected credit losses from accounts receivable are recognized as expense in our statement of operations.
Deferred Commissions
Sales commissions, including related fringe benefit costs, are considered to be incremental costs of obtaining a contract. Sales commissions on initial sales are not commensurate with sales commissions on contract renewals and therefore are recognized over an estimated period of benefit, which ranges between 
three
 and 
four years
 for subscription arrangements and 
five years
 for perpetual license arrangements. We estimate the period of benefit based on the expected contract term including renewal periods, the lifecycle of our technology and other factors. Sales commissions on contract renewals are capitalized and amortized ratably over the contract term as part of sales and marketing expense, with the exception of contracts with renewal periods that are one year or less, in which case the incremental costs are expensed as incurred.
79
Table of Contents
Property and Equipment, net
Property and equipment, net is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets: 
three years
 for computer software and equipment and 
five years
 for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the respective leases. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement contains a lease and the classification of that lease, if applicable, at inception. We have elected to not recognize a lease liability or right-of-use ("ROU") asset for short-term leases (leases with a term of twelve months or less). For contracts with lease and non-lease components, we have elected to not allocate the contract consideration, and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, we enter into arrangements to use shared office spaces and other facilities, and have determined that these arrangements do not contain leases as we do not have the right to use an identified asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities (net of current portion) in our consolidated balance sheets.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The implicit rate within our operating leases is generally not determinable and we use our incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The determination of our incremental borrowing rate requires judgment. We determine our incremental borrowing rate for each lease using our current borrowing rate, adjusted for various factors including level of collateralization, term and currency to align with the terms of the lease. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease prepayments, offset by lease incentives. Certain of our leases include options to extend or terminate the lease. An option to extend the lease is considered in connection with determining the ROU asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option. An option to terminate is considered unless it is reasonably certain we will not exercise the option.
Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Any sublease income is recorded as a reduction of lease expense.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. Recoverability of the long-lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.
 In 2024 we executed a sublease of our headquarters and recorded a $
4.5
 million impairment for furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements. There was 
no
 impairment of long-lived assets in 2023 or 2022.
Business Combinations
We account for business combinations by recognizing the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The excess purchase consideration over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, a non-recurring Level 3 fair value measurement, we make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets such as identified acquired technology and trade names. We generally determine the fair value of acquired technology using the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach. However in certain situations we may use the cost approach. Estimates in valuing identifiable intangible assets include, but are not limited to, projected revenue growth rates, obsolescence projections and an appropriate discount rate. Our estimate of fair value is based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, we may make adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with offsetting adjustments to goodwill. Any 
80
Table of Contents
adjustments made after the measurement period will be reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill
The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. We perform our annual impairment assessment on October 1, or more frequently, when events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. We operate as 
one
 reporting unit and have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company as a whole is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment includes an evaluation of relevant events and circumstances, including macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, our overall financial performance, and trends in the value of our common stock. During the periods presented, there were no indications of impairment and it was not more likely than not that goodwill was impaired.
Common Stock
Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorized 
500,000,000
 shares of common stock and 
10,000,000
 shares of preferred stock. There were 
no
 shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding at December 31, 2024 or 2023. The voting, dividend, and liquidation rights of common stockholders are subject to, and qualified by, the rights of preferred stockholders. The common stockholders are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if, declared by the Board of Directors, subject to preferential dividend rights of preferred stockholders. Upon dissolution or liquidation, our common stockholders will be entitled to receive all assets available for distribution to stockholders, subject to any preferential rights of preferred stockholders.
Treasury Stock
In November 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $
100
 million of our common stock. In October 2024, our Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization by $
200
 million. We account for purchases of treasury stock under the cost method. Shares are held for future issuance and not retired.
 In 2024, we purchased 
2.3
 million shares for $
100.0
 million and in 2023 we purchased 
0.4
 million shares for $
14.9
 million. The remaining amount available under the stock repurchase program was $
185.1
 million at December 31, 2024.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units ("RSUs"), purchase rights issued under our 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("2018 ESPP"), stock options and restricted stock is calculated based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally 
two
 to 
four years
. Our performance stock units ("PSUs") vest over a period of 
4
 years and are subject to defined performance and service conditions. Our PSUs are expensed using the accelerated attribution method. We account for forfeitures as they occur.
The fair value of RSUs, PSUs and restricted stock is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of 2018 ESPP purchase rights is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires us to make assumptions and judgments, including the expected term, expected volatility, and risk-free interest rates. We use the market price of our common stock at the date of grant.
Advertising
Advertising costs are expensed as they are incurred.
 We incurred advertising costs of $
13.8
 million, $
16.2
 million and $
13.6
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Software Development Costs
Research and development costs to develop software to be sold, leased or marketed are expensed as incurred up to 
81
Table of Contents
the point of technological feasibility for the related software product. We have not capitalized development costs for software to be sold, leased or marketed to date, as the software development process is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility. As such, these costs are expensed as incurred and recognized in research and development costs in the consolidated statements of operations.
Software developed for internal use, with no substantive plans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized and included in property and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation and post implementation stages of the project are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized.
 In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we capitalized $
8.2
 million, $
8.8
 million and $
11.5
 million of development costs related to internal use software, including capitalized stock-based compensation of $
1.7
 million, $
1.7
 million, and $
1.7
 million, respectively.
Restructuring

Restructuring expenses consist of non-ordinary course severance, employee related benefits and other charges to reorganize business operations. The $
6.1
 million of restructuring expense in 2024 consisted of $
4.5
 million non-cash impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures that was recorded in connection with the sublease of a portion of our headquarters in 2024 and $
1.5
 million in non-ordinary course severance and employee related benefits. The $
4.5
 million of restructuring expense in 2023 related to the optimization of our go-to-market efforts, including reducing our reliance on sales specialists and streamlining layers of management. We completed our restructuring in the second quarter of 2024.
Net Loss per Share
We calculate basic net loss per share by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. 
Diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents in the period, including unvested RSUs, PSUs, stock options, unvested restricted shares and shares to be issued under our 2018 ESPP. As we have reported losses for all periods presented, all potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their effect would be antidilutive.
Segment Information
We operate as 
one
 operating segment as our interim co-chief executive officers, who are our chief operating decision makers ("CODMs"), review financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. This method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. We have elected to treat taxes related to GILTI as a period cost. A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
We recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. Interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions are classified as a component of income tax expense.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-07 - Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This requires public entities with a single reportable segment to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") and included within the reported measure(s) of a 
82
Table of Contents
segment's profit or loss, the amount and composition of any other segment items, the title and position of the CODM, and how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of a segment's profit or loss to assess performance and decide how to allocate resources. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as we operate as 
one
 operating segment and significant segment expenses are disclosed in our consolidated statements of operations. See Note 13 for our segment disclosures. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-09 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities to provide greater disaggregation within their annual rate reconciliation, including new requirements to present reconciling items on a gross basis in specified categories, disclose both percentages and dollar amounts, and disaggregate individual reconciling items by jurisdiction and nature when the effect of the items meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance also requires disaggregating the annual disclosure of income taxes paid, net of refunds received, by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes, with separate presentation of individual jurisdictions that meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025 on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option, and early adoption is permitted. Adopting this guidance will result in additional annual tax disclosures but will not impact our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 - Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires public entities to disclose, on an annual and interim basis, disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items. The ASU also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses recognized in continuing operations on an annual and interim basis and disclosure of a public business entity’s definition of selling expenses on an annual basis (or in interim reporting periods if the definition is changed). The guidance is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2026 on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

We considered the extent to which any unrealized losses on our short-term investments were driven by credit risk and other factors, including market risk, and if it is more-likely-than-not that we would have to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our unrealized losses were due to rising market interest rates compared to when the investments were initiated. We do not believe any unrealized losses represent credit losses, and it is unlikely we would sell the investments before we would recover their amortized cost basis.

Fair Value Measurements
We measure certain financial instruments at fair value using a fair value hierarchy. In the hierarchy, assets are classified based on the lowest level inputs used in valuation into the following categories:
•
Level 1
 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
•
Level 2
 — Observable inputs including quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in inactive markets, or inputs that are corroborated by observable market data; and
•
Level 3
 — Unobservable inputs.

Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Business Combinations
In June 2024, we acquired Eureka Security, Inc. ("Eureka"), a provider of data security posture management ("DSPM") for cloud environments. Adding Eureka's DSPM capabilities to our solutions provides customers a view into their organization's cloud data security footprint, fight policy drift and misconfigurations that put data at risk, and enables customers to continuously improve their security posture over time. We acquired 
100
% of Eureka's equity through a share purchase agreement for total cash consideration of $
29.2
 million, net of $
0.4
 million cash acquired.
In October 2023, we acquired Ermetic, an innovative cloud-native application protection platform company and a leading provider of cloud infrastructure entitlement management. The addition of Ermetic enhances Tenable One and Tenable Cloud Security to deliver contextual risk visibility, prioritization and remediation across infrastructure and identities both on-premises and in the cloud. We acquired 
100
% of Ermetic's equity through a share purchase agreement for total consideration of $
243.8
 million, including $
243.3
 million in cash, net of $
6.1

We may be subject to mandatory Term Loan prepayments related to the excess cash flow provisions. These prepayments would only be required if our first lien net leverage ratio (as defined in our Credit Agreement) exceeds 
3.5
 at the end of each year. At December 31, 2024, our first lien net leverage ratio was 
0.86
.
The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate, depending on first lien net leverage, ranging from 
2.00
% to 
2.50
% over SOFR and matures on July 7, 2026. Additionally, we pay a commitment fee during the term ranging from 
0.25
% to 
0.375
% per annum of the average daily undrawn portion of the revolving commitments based on the first lien net leverage ratio. The Revolving Credit Facility contains a $
15.0
 million letter of credit sublimit.
The Credit Agreement contains certain customary events of default, which include failure to make payments when due, the material inaccuracy of representations or warranties, failure to observe or perform certain covenants, cross-defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency-related events, certain judgments, certain ERISA-related events, failure of any lien created under the Security Documents (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to be valid and perfected (subject to certain exceptions), failure of any material guarantee of the Loan Document Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to be in full force and effect and a Change of Control (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by the Company and Tenable Public Sector LLC, an indirect subsidiary of the Company, as guarantors, and is supported by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of Tenable, Inc. and the guarantors.
The Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including certain restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness or guaranteeing indebtedness of others, creating liens on properties or assets, making certain investments, loans, advances and guarantees, selling assets, making certain restricted payments and entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions, affiliate transactions, restrictive agreements and asset and stock-based transactions. Additionally, if at least 
35
% of the Revolving Credit Facility is drawn on the last day of the quarter, the total net leverage ratio cannot be greater than 
5.50
 to 1.00. At December 31, 2024, we had $
0.2
 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility related to one of our operating leases. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement.

Stock options were last granted in 2018. Stock options granted under our stock incentive plans have a maximum term of 
ten years
, generally vest over a period of 
three
 to 
four years
, and the exercise price cannot be less than the fair market value on the date of grant.
Estimating the fair value of ESPP purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires assumptions as to the fair value of common stock, expected term, expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend yield. 
Fair Value of Common Stock. 
We use the market price of our common stock at the date of grant.
Expected Term. 
We use the actual purchase periods as the expected term in the 2018 ESPP.
Expected Volatility. 
Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable, such as a share price, has fluctuated (historical volatility) or is expected to fluctuate (expected volatility) during a period. In 2021, we began using the volatility of our common stock to calculate expected volatility. Prior to 2021, we identified several public entities of similar size, complexity, and stage of development and estimated our volatility based on the volatility of the common stock of these companies. 
Risk-Free Interest Rate. 
This is the U.S. Treasury rate, having a term that most closely resembles the expected life of the stock option.
Expected Dividend Yield. 
We have never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.
2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under our 2018 ESPP, employees may set aside up to 
15
% of their gross earnings, on an after-tax basis, to purchase our common stock at a discounted price, which is calculated at 
85
% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on the first day of an offering or on the date of purchase. The 2018 ESPP permits offerings up to 
27
 months in duration, with one or more purchase periods in each offering. Additionally, in cases where the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the first day of a new purchase period within an offering is less than or equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock at the beginning of the offering, that offering will be terminated and participants will be automatically enrolled in a new offering with a new 
24
-month duration and purchase periods every 
six months
.

In connection with the 2022 acquisition of Bit Discovery, Inc., we elected to first offset our existing deferred tax assets with acquired deferred tax liabilities. This resulted in releasing $
2.5
 million of the federal and state valuation allowance, which was recorded as a component of our deferred tax benefit.
We restructured our operations in Israel through intercompany transactions, which resulted in $
1.2
 million and $

We maintain a valuation allowance on certain U.S. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets as the realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. In 2024, our valuation allowance increased by $
16.0
 million, primarily related to our 2024 loss before income taxes and U.S. R&D tax credits.

At December 31, 2024, we had net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards for federal, state and foreign tax purposes of $
353.9
 million, $
239.3
 million, and $
468.6
 million, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2030, as well as $
32.1
 million of federal, state and foreign research and development tax credits, foreign tax credits, minimum tax credits and certain states’ job creation tax credits. The federal research and development and foreign tax credits will begin to expire in 2032 and the state job creation tax credits will begin to expire in 2025.
We are currently subject to the annual limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code. We will not be precluded from realizing the NOL carryforward and tax credits but may be limited in the amount we could utilize in any given tax year in the event that the federal and state taxable income will exceed the limitation imposed by Section 382. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on our value immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $
8.5
 million and $
8.3
 million, respectively, which, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate by approximately $
0.2
 million in each year. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions recognized as a component of income tax expense were immaterial in 2024, 2023 and 2022.

We file income tax returns in the United States, including various state jurisdictions. Our subsidiaries file income tax returns in various foreign jurisdictions. Tax years after 2014 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. At December 31, 2024, we were not under examination for income tax audits by the Internal Revenue Service. We are currently under tax examination in France for tax years 2019 through 2022.
Depending on the jurisdiction, distributions of earnings could be subject to withholding taxes at rates applicable to the distributing jurisdiction. As we intend to continue to reinvest the earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely, we have not provided for a U.S. income tax liability and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested foreign earnings.

Item 9.        Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that at December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was (a) reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and regulations and (b) communicated to our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding any required disclosure.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2024. 
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP (PCAOB ID: 
42
), has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud.
