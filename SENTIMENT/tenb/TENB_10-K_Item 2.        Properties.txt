Item 2.        Properties
Our corporate headquarters in Columbia, Maryland consist of approximately 160,000 square feet under a lease that expires in February 2032. We maintain additional offices in multiple locations internationally in Europe and the Middle East, Asia Pacific and South America. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our ongoing needs and that suitable additional alternative spaces will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
