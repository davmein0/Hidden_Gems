This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections entitled "Business," "Risk Factors," and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Statements that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “objective,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “potential,” “should,” “will,” or “would,” or the negative of these terms, or other comparable terminology intended to identify statements about the future. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following:
•
the anticipated impact of geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the regional conflict in the Middle East, and rising tensions between China and Taiwan, and related sanctions, tariffs imposed by the United States or other governments, global economic uncertainty and financial market conditions on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including on our sales and our revenue growth rate;

•
our ability to maintain and expand our customer base, including by attracting new customers;
•
our relationships with third parties, including channel partners;
•
completed and potential acquisitions and integration of complementary businesses and technologies;
•
our ability to maintain, or strengthen awareness of, our brand;

perceived or actual problems with the security, integrity, reliability, compatibility and quality of our platform and solutions;
•
future revenue, hiring plans, expenses, capital expenditures, capital requirements and stock performance;
•
our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel and further expand our overall headcount;
•

•
our ability to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property;
•
costs associated with defending intellectual property infringement and other claims; and
•
the future trading prices of our common stock and the impact of securities analysts’ reports on these prices.
These statements represent the beliefs and assumptions of our management based on information currently available to us. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results and the timing of certain events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included under Part I, Item 1A. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.
