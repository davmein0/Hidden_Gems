•
The increase in net sales within the Human Nutrition and Health segment for 2024 compared to 2023 was driven by higher sales within both the nutrients business and the food ingredients and solutions businesses. Total sales for this segment grew 9.0%, with volume and mix contributing 6.6% and average selling prices contributing 2.4%.
•
The decrease in net sales within the Animal Nutrition and Health segment for 2024 compared to 2023 was driven by lower sales in both the monogastric and ruminant species markets. Total sales for this segment decreased by 9.9%, with average selling prices contributing -6.1% and volume and mix contributing -3.8%.
•
The increase in net sales within the Specialty Products segment for 2024 compared to 2023 was due to higher sales in the performance gases market, partially offset by lower sales in the plant nutrition business. Total sales for this segment increased by 5.4%, with average selling prices contributing 3.9% and volume and mix contributing 1.4%.
•
Sales relating to Other decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower average selling prices.
•
Sales may fluctuate in future periods based on macroeconomic conditions, competitive dynamics, changes in customer preferences, and our ability to successfully introduce new products to the market.

Animal Nutrition & Health segment earnings from operations decreased $13,563. Gross margin decreased $11,198 primarily due to the aforementioned lower sales, partially offset by certain lower manufacturing input costs. 

•
Specialty Products segment earnings from operations increased $5,327 due to an increase in gross margin of $9,518. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the aforementioned higher sales and certain lower manufacturing input costs. This was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $4,191, mainly due to higher compensation-related costs.
•
The decrease in Other and unallocated was primarily driven by the aforementioned lower sales, partially offset by lower unallocated corporate expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
(All amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)
Contractual Obligations
Our short-term purchase obligations primarily include contractual arrangements in the form of purchase orders with suppliers. As of December 31, 2024, such purchase obligations were $103,255. For debt obligations, see Note 8, 
Revolving Loan
, and for operating and finance lease obligations, see Note 19,
 Leases
. 
We are not aware of any current or pending demands on, or commitments for, our liquid assets that will materially affect our liquidity. 
There were no material changes during the year ended December 31, 2024 outside the ordinary course of business in the specified contractual obligations set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
We expect our operations to continue generating sufficient cash flow to fund working capital requirements and necessary capital investments. We are actively pursuing additional acquisition candidates. We could seek additional bank loans or access to financial markets to fund such acquisitions, our operations, working capital, necessary capital investments or other cash requirements should we deem it necessary to do so.
Cash
Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $49,515 at December 31, 2024 from $64,447 at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, we had $44,189 of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries. We presently intend to permanently reinvest these funds in foreign operations by continuing to make additional plant related investments, and potentially invest in partnerships or acquisitions; therefore, we do not currently expect to repatriate these funds in order to fund U.S. operations or obligations. However, if these funds are needed for U.S. operations, we could be required to pay additional withholding taxes to repatriate these funds. In 2023, due to prevailing economic conditions of increased interest rates and subsequent borrowing costs, we remitted approximately $18,000 from our Belgium subsidiary to pay down U.S. debt, resulting in income tax expense of $20.  Working capital was $156,085 at December 31, 2024 as compared to $165,751 at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $9,666. Significant cash payments during the year included net payments on the revolving loan of $119,569, income taxes paid of $42,643, capital expenditures and intangible assets acquired of $35,661, the payment of the 2023 declared dividend in 2024 of $25,576, and cash paid for an acquisition of $24,164.

Operating Activities
The decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily driven by the impact from changes in working capital.
Investing Activities
We continue to invest in corporate projects, improvements across all production facilities, and intangible assets. Total investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were $35,661 and $37,892 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $40,000 to $45,000 for 2025. As mentioned above, we expect that our operations will continue to generate sufficient cash flow to fund the commitments for capital expenditures. These capital expenditures are part of our continuous efforts to support our growing businesses.  Cash paid to acquire an existing toll manufacturer to add capacity amounted to $24,164 for the year ended December 31, 2024, net of cash acquired.  Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, amounted to $1,252  for year ended December 31, 2023.
Financing Activities
In 2024, we borrowed $26,000 to fund the payment of the 2023 dividend and made total loan repayments of $145,569, resulting in $360,000 available under the 2022 Credit Agreement (see Note 8, 
Revolving Loan
) as of December 31, 2024.
We have an approved stock repurchase program. The total authorization under this program is 3,763,038 shares. Since the inception of the program in June 1999, a total of 3,142,028 shares have been repurchased. We intend to acquire shares from time to time at prevailing market prices if and to the extent we deem it is advisable to do so based on our assessment of corporate cash flow, market conditions and other factors. Open market repurchases of common stock could be made pursuant to a trading plan established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would permit common stock to be repurchased at a time that we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or self-imposed trading restrictions. We also purchase (withhold) shares from employees in connection with the tax settlement of vested shares and/or exercised stock options under the Company's omnibus incentive plan. Share repurchases are funded with existing cash on hand.
Proceeds from stock options exercised were $17,228 and $5,242 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Dividend payments were $25,576 and $22,872 during 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Other Matters Impacting Liquidity
We have a liability of $6,720 for uncertain tax positions, including the related interest and penalties, recorded in accordance with ASC 740-10, for which we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement, if any. 
We currently provide postretirement benefits in the form of two retirement medical plans, as discussed in Note 15, 
Employee Benefit Plans
. The liability recorded in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $1,522 and $1,395, respectively, and the plans are not funded. Historical cash payments made under these plans have typically been less than $200 per year. We do not anticipate any changes to the payments made in the current year for the plans.
Balchem NV ("Chemogas") has an unfunded defined benefit plan. The plan provides for the payment of a lump sum at retirement or payments in case of death of the covered employees. The amount recorded for these obligations on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $613 and $420, respectively, and was included in other long-term obligations.
We provide an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees. Assets of the plan are held in a rabbi trust, which are included in "Other non-current assets" on the consolidated balance sheet. They are subject to additional risk of loss in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company.  The deferred compensation liability was $11,470 as of December 31, 2024, of which $11,449 was included in "Other long-term obligations" and $21 was included in "Accrued compensation and other benefits" on our condensed consolidated

balance sheets. The deferred compensation liability was $10,188 as of December 31, 2023 and was included in "Other long-term obligations" on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The related rabbi trust assets were $11,465 and $10,188 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were included in "Other non-current assets" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
Related Party Transactions
We were engaged in related party transactions with St. Gabriel CC Company, LLC for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 18, 
Related Party Transactions
.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our management is required to make these critical accounting estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Our critical accounting estimates are those that require application of management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Management considers the following to be critical accounting estimates.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The valuation methods and assumptions used in valuing goodwill and identified intangibles and assessing the impairment of goodwill and identified intangibles involves a significant level of estimation uncertainty. In addition, the assumptions used in determining the useful life of an intangible asset involves a significant level of estimation uncertainty. Refer to the Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets section in Note 1, 
Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
, for details related to the valuation and impairment process of both goodwill and intangible assets. Changes in market conditions, laws and regulations, and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could result in the recognition of an impairment charge, and in turn could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in subsequent periods. 
Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1, 
Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements.
Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Our cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in checking accounts, certificates of deposit, and money market investment funds. In 2019, we entered into an interest rate swap and cross-currency swap for hedging purposes. These derivatives settled on their maturity date of June 27, 2023. Refer to details noted below (see Note 20, 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
). Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, our borrowings were under a revolving loan bearing interest at a fluctuating rate as defined by the 2022 Credit Agreement plus an applicable rate (see Note 8, 
Revolving Loan
). The applicable rate is based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, applied to our borrowings at December 31, 2024, would result in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense and a corresponding reduction or increase in cash flow of approximately $1,900. We are exposed to commodity price risks, including prices of our primary raw materials. Our objective is to seek a reduction in the potential negative earnings impact of raw material pricing arising in our business activities. We manage these financial exposures, where possible, through pricing and operational means. Our practices may change as economic conditions change. 
Interest Rate Risk
We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates, including the interest rate relating to the 2022 Credit Agreement. In the second quarter of 2019, we began to manage our interest rate exposure through the use of derivative instruments. These 
27
Table of Contents
derivatives were utilized for risk management purposes, and were not used for trading or speculative purposes. We hedged a portion of our floating interest rate exposure using an interest rate swap (see Note 20, 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
). This derivative settled on its maturity date of June 27, 2023. 
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
The financial condition and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are reported in local currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to these currencies. In 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap, with a notional amount of $108,569, which we designated as a hedge of our net investment in Chemogas (see Note 20, 
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
). This derivative settled on its maturity date of June 27, 2023.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Balchem Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Balchem Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and schedule (collectively, the financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.  
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Table of Contents
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Valuation of Reporting Units for Goodwill Impairment Testing
As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance was $780 million as of December 31, 2024. The Company performed an annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2024, using a quantitative evaluation for each of its reporting units. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using the income approach, based on a discounted cash flow valuation model. To test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. When determining the fair value of each reporting unit, management makes significant estimates and assumptions related to a number of factors. The Company considers the impact of factors that are specific to each of the reporting units such as industry and economic changes as well as projected sales and expense growth rates based upon annual budgets and longer-range strategic plans, which are highly sensitive to changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions, and the selection of appropriate discount rates.
Given the significant estimates and assumptions management makes to determine the fair value of the reporting units  we identified management’s assumptions related to the sales  growth rates, projected gross margin rates and certain components of the discount rates utilized in the valuation of the reporting units within the Company’s goodwill impairment tests as a critical audit matter. Auditing the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.
Our audit procedures related to sales and expense growth rates, discount rates, and the terminal value calculation utilized in the valuation of the Company’s reporting units included the following, among others:
•
We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the valuation of the Company’s reporting units and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including management review controls over significant assumptions.
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts of sales growth rates and projected gross margin rates by comparing the forecasts to: (1) the historical results, (2) internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, and (3) external communications made by management to analysts and investors, as applicable.
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates and tested the relevance and reliability of source information underlying the determination of the discount rates, tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the discount rates selected by management.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business Description
Balchem Corporation (“Balchem” or the “Company”), including, unless the context otherwise requires, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, incorporated in the State of Maryland in 1967, is engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of specialty performance ingredients and products for the food, nutritional, feed, pharmaceutical, agricultural, and medical device sterilization industries. 
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Revenue Recognition
Revenue for each of the Company’s business segments is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to realize in exchange for those goods. The Company reports amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and includes costs incurred for shipping and handling in cost of sales. Amounts received for unshipped merchandise are not recognized as revenue but rather they are recorded as customer deposits and are included in current liabilities. In instances of shipments made on consignment, revenue is recognized when control is transferred to the customer. 
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, revenue-generating contracts are assessed to identify distinct performance obligations, allocating transaction prices to those performance obligations, and criteria for satisfaction of a performance obligation. The standard allows for recognition of revenue only when we have satisfied a performance obligation through transferring control of the promised good or service to a customer. Control, in this instance, may mean the ability to prevent other entities from directing the use of, and receiving benefit from, a good or service. The standard indicates that an entity must determine at contract inception whether it will transfer control of a promised good or service over time or satisfy the performance obligation at a point in time through analysis of the following criteria: (i) the entity has a present right to payment, (ii) the customer has legal title, (iii) the customer has physical possession, (iv) the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership and (v) the customer has accepted the asset. The Company assesses collectability based primarily on the customer’s payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company has funds in its cash accounts that are with third party financial institutions, primarily in certificates of deposit and money market funds. The Company's balances of cash and cash equivalents in the U.S. and other countries exceed the insurance limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and other relevant insurance limits in other countries.

Accounts Receivable
Credit terms are granted in the normal course of business to the Company’s customers and on-going credit evaluations are performed on the Company’s customers. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments", which requires that credit losses be reported based on expected losses instead of the incurred loss model. Based on this ASU, customers' credit limits are adjusted based upon their reasonably expected credit worthiness which is determined through review of their payment history, their current credit information, and any foreseeable future events. Collections and payments from customers are continuously monitored and allowances for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments are maintained. Estimated losses are based on historical experience, any specific customer collection issues identified, and any reasonably expected future adverse events. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required.

Table of Contents
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or net realizable value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess or obsolete inventories. Cost elements include material, labor and manufacturing overhead.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
Buildings
15
-
25
 years
Equipment
2
-
28
 years
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense. Alterations and major overhauls that extend the lives or increase the capacity of plant assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the assets and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resultant gain or loss is included in earnings from operations.
Business Concentrations
Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable and money market investments. Investments are managed within established guidelines to mitigate risks. Accounts receivable subject the Company to credit risk partially due to the concentration of amounts due from customers. The Company extends credit to its customers based upon an evaluation of the customers’ financial condition and credit histories.
 In 2024, 2023 and 2022, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total net sales or accounts receivable.
Post-employment Benefits
We provide life insurance, health care benefits, and defined benefit pension plan payments for certain eligible retirees and health care benefits for certain retirees’ eligible survivors. The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect our assumptions as to health care cost trends and key economic conditions including discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, and expected salary increases. The cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation. If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease.
In accordance with ASC 715, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits,” we are required to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in our statement of financial position, and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income.
Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations". Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are instead assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired, in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other". The Company performed its annual test as of October 1. ASC 350 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” (“ASU 2017-04”), which addresses changes to the testing for goodwill impairment by eliminating Step 2 of the process. In accordance with this update, a goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. 
As of October 1, 2024 and 2023, the Company opted to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company assessed the fair values of its reporting units by utilizing the income approach, based on a discounted cash flow valuation model as the basis for its conclusions. The Company's estimates of future cash flows included significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, certain components of 
38
Table of Contents
the discount rates, estimated terminal values and future economic and market conditions. The Company's assessment concluded that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. Accordingly, the goodwill of the reporting units was not considered impaired as of October 1, 2024 and 2023. The Company may resume performing the qualitative assessment in subsequent periods.
The following intangible assets with finite lives are stated at cost and are amortized either on an accelerated basis or on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:

Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is generally based on discounted cash flows. The useful life of an intangible asset is based on our assumptions regarding expected use of the asset; the relationship of the intangible asset to another asset or group of assets; any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the asset or that enable renewal or extension of the asset’s legal or contractual life without substantial cost; the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors; and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset and their related impact on the asset’s useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the life of an intangible asset has changed, it could result in higher future amortization charges or recognition of an impairment loss. For the year ended December 31, 2024, there were no triggering events which required intangible asset impairment reviews.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.
We recognize uncertain income tax positions taken on income tax returns at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a fifty percent likelihood of being sustained.
Our policy for recording interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions is to record such items as a component of our income tax provision.
Use of Estimates
Management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company has a number of financial instruments, none of which are held for trading purposes. The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. 
39
Table of Contents
Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value, and, accordingly, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The carrying value of debt approximates fair value as the interest rate is based on market and the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The Company’s financial instruments also include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and are carried at cost which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
In addition, non-current assets includes rabbi trust funds related to the Company's deferred compensation plan. The money market and rabbi trust funds are valued using level one inputs, as defined by ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurement."
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales are primarily comprised of raw materials consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, maintenance labor, depreciation expense, and overhead expense necessary to convert purchased materials and supplies into finished product. Cost of sales also includes inbound freight costs, outbound freight costs for shipping products to customers, warehousing costs, quality control and obsolescence expense.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit costs, amortization of customer relationships and lists, trade promotions, advertising, commissions and other marketing costs. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefit costs, occupancy and operating costs of corporate offices, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets, information systems costs and other miscellaneous administrative costs.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are associated directly with the Company's efforts to develop, design, and enhance its products, services, technologies, or processes. Such costs are expensed as incurred.
Net Earnings Per Common Share
Basic net earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share is calculated in a manner consistent with basic net earnings per common share except that the weighted average number of common shares outstanding also includes the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding, unvested restricted stock, and unvested performance shares (using the treasury stock method).
Stock-based Compensation
The Company has stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 3, 
Stockholders' Equity
. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation-Stock Compensation,” which requires all share-based payments, including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the statement of earnings as an operating expense, based on their fair values. The Company estimates the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes model or the Binomial model, whichever is deemed to be most appropriate. Estimates of and assumptions about forfeiture rates, terms, volatility, interest rates and dividend yields are used to calculate stock-based compensation. A significant change to these estimates could materially affect the Company’s operating results.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is generally based on discounted cash flows.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company is exposed to market fluctuations in interest rates as well as variability in foreign exchange rates. In May 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with JP Morgan Chase, N.A. (the "Swap Counterparty") and a cross-currency swap with JP Morgan Chase, N.A. (the "Bank Counterparty"). The Company's primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments was to manage interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
40
Table of Contents
The derivative instruments were with the above single counterparty and were subject to a contractual agreement that provided for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment in a single currency in the event of default on or termination of any one contract. As such, the derivative instruments were categorized as a master netting arrangement and presented as a net derivative asset or derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company settled its derivative instruments on their maturity date of June 27, 2023 and had no other derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
On a quarterly basis through their maturity, we assessed the effectiveness of the hedging relationships for the interest rate swap and cross-currency swap by reviewing the critical terms indicated in the applicable agreement. The hedging relationships were determined to be highly effective. As such, the net change in fair values of the interest rate swap, that qualified as a cash flow hedge, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and subsequently reclassified into interest expense as interest payments were made on our debt. For the cross-currency swap, the amounts that have not yet been recognized in earnings remain in the cumulative translation adjustment section of accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated in accordance with paragraphs 815-35-35-5A, "Derivatives and Hedging - Net Investment Hedges", and 830-30-40-1 through 40-1A, "Foreign Currency Matters - Derecognition". Refer to Note 20,

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)." The new guidance is intended to enhance transparency and disclosures by requiring public entities to provide disaggregated disclosures of certain categories of expenses on an annual and interim basis. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2024-03 will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures." The new guidance is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by requiring disaggregated information about a reporting entity's effective tax rate reconciliation and information on income taxes paid. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendment in this Update should be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures." The ASU expands reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. The ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment's profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Additionally, ASU 2023-07 requires all segment profit or loss and assets disclosures to be provided on an annual and interim basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning December 15, 2024. The Company adopted this accounting guidance on December 31, 2024, and applied it retrospectively to all prior periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 11, 
Segment Information
 for the expanded disclosures.   
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting", and in December 2022 subsequently issued ASU 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848.” These ASU’s provide temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The Standards Updates provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to contract modifications and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate that are expected to be discontinued. The Standards Updates were effective upon issuance and can generally be applied through December 31, 2024. Due to the discontinuation of LIBOR and under the relief provided by Topic 848, during the third quarter of 2022, the Company modified its interest rate swap and replaced LIBOR with 1-month CME Term SOFR. The modification of the agreement did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The interest rate swap matured on June 27, 2023.

SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS
Cardinal Associates Inc. ("Bergstrom")
On August 30, 2022, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Albion Laboratories, Inc. ("Albion") entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement, and closed on such transaction with Cardinal Associates Inc. ("Cardinal"), a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Washington, pursuant to which Albion acquired Cardinal and its Bergstrom Nutrition business (collectively, "Bergstrom"). Bergstrom Nutrition is a leading science-based manufacturer of MSM, based in Vancouver, Washington. MSM is a widely used nutritional ingredient with strong scientific evidence supporting its benefits for joint health, sports nutrition, skin and beauty, healthy aging, and pet health. The addition of OptiMSM
®
, Bergstrom Nutrition's MSM brand, to the Company's portfolio within the Human Nutrition and Health and Animal Nutrition and Health segments provides a synergistic scientific advantage in Balchem's key strategic therapeutic focus areas such as longevity and performance and is a strong fit with Balchem's specialty, science-backed mineral products. 
The Company made payments of $
72,143
 for the acquisition, amounting to $
71,937
 to the former shareholders or on behalf of the former shareholders and $
206
 to pay off Bergstrom's bank debt. Net of cash acquired of $
773
, total payments made to the former shareholders or on behalf of the former shareholders of Bergstrom were $
71,164
. The acquisition was primarily financed through the 2022 Credit Agreement (see Note 8, 
Revolving Loan
).  In connection with this transaction, the former shareholders of Bergstrom had an opportunity to receive an additional payment in 2024 if certain financial performance targets and other metrics were met.  The earn-out payment of $
9
 was paid out in 2024.  Therefore, there was no contingent consideration liability at December 31, 2024.  The Company also made an additional post-closing payment of $
910
 in the third quarter of 2023 that was negotiated as a deduction of the cash consideration at closing. As a result, total payments related to the transaction were $
72,152
, comprised of the upfront cash consideration of $
70,892
, a working capital adjustment of $
341
, an additional post-closing payment of $
910
, and the fair value of the earn-out payment of $

Kechu BidCo AS and Its Subsidiary Companies ("Kappa")
On June 21, 2022, Balchem Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Balchem B.V., completed the acquisition of Kechu BidCo AS and its subsidiary companies, including Kappa Bioscience AS, a leading science-based manufacturer of specialty vitamin K2 for the human nutrition industry, headquartered in Oslo, Norway (all acquired companies collectively referred to as “Kappa”). Kappa manufactures specialty vitamin K2, which plays a crucial role in the human body for bone health, heart health and immunity. Primarily, vitamin K2 supports the transport and distribution of calcium in the body. Vitamin K2 is important at all life stages, from pregnancy and early life to healthy aging. The acquisition strengthens the Company's scientific and technical expertise, geographic reach, and marketplace leadership, which should ultimately lead to accelerated growth for the Company's portfolios within the Human Nutrition and Health segment.

On December 31, 2024, the Company had 
one
 share-based compensation plan under which awards may be granted, which is described below.
In June 2017, the Company’s shareholders approved the Balchem Corporation 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (“2017 Plan”) for officers, employees and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. The 2017 Plan replaced the 1999 Stock Plan and amendments and restatements thereto (collectively to be referred to as the “1999 Plan"), which expired in April 2018. No further awards will be made under the 1999 Plan, and the shares that remained available for grant under the 1999 Plan will only be used to settle outstanding awards granted under the 1999 Plan and will not become available under the 2017 Plan. On June 22, 2023, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment and restatement of the 2017 Plan (the “Amended 2017 Plan”). The 
45
Table of Contents
Amended 2017 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Amended 2017 Plan provides as follows: (i) for a termination date of June 22, 2033; (ii) the authorization of 
2,400,000
 shares for future grants (which represents an increase of 
800,000
 shares from the amount approved under the 2017 Plan); (iii) for the making of grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and other stock-based awards, as well as for the making of cash performance awards; (iv) except as provided by the Compensation Committee or in an employment agreement as in effect on the effective date of the Amended 2017 Plan, no automatic acceleration of outstanding awards upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company; (v) certain annual limits on the number of shares and amount of cash that may be granted; (vi) for dividends or dividend equivalents otherwise payable on an unvested award to accrue and be paid only at such time as the vesting conditions applicable to the underlying award have been satisfied; (vii) for incentive compensation recovery if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements, in accordance with any compensation recovery policy adopted by the Company, applicable law, government regulations or national securities exchange requirements, or in the discretion of the Compensation Committee in the event of a restatement due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the securities laws; and (viii) for compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code” or the “Code”).  No option will be exercisable for longer than 
ten years
 after the date of grant.
The shares to be issued upon exercise of the outstanding options have been approved, reserved and are adequate to cover all exercises. As of December 31, 2024, the Amended 2017 Plan had 
836,521
 shares available for future awards.
The Company has Restricted Stock Grant Agreements with the Company's non–employee directors and certain employees. Under the Restricted Stock Grant Agreements, certain shares of the Common Stock have been granted, ranging from 
70
 shares to

 shares, to its non-employee directors and certain employees, subject to time-based vesting requirements.
The Company also has performance share (“PS”) awards, which provide the recipients the right to receive a certain number of shares of the Common Stock in the future, subject to an (1) EBITDA performance hurdle, where vesting is dependent upon the Company achieving a certain EBITDA percentage growth over the performance period, and (2) relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) market condition where vesting is dependent upon the Company’s TSR performance over the performance period (typically 
three years
) relative to a comparator group consisting of the Russell 2000 index constituents.
The fair value of each option award issued under the Company’s stock plans is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes model or the Binomial model, whichever is deemed to be most appropriate. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the fair value of each option grant uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The expected term of the options is based on the Company’s historical experience of employees’ exercise behavior. Dividend yields are based on the Company’s historical dividend yields. 
Risk-free interest rates are based on the implied yields currently available on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life.

The value of the restricted shares is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant.
Performance Share expense is measured based on the fair value at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes methodology to produce a Monte-Carlo simulation model which allows for the incorporation of the performance hurdles that must be met before the Performance Share vests. The assumptions used in the fair value determination were risk free interest rates of 
4.2

%, 
4.2
%, and -
15.7
% in each case for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Expense is based on the estimated number of shares expected to vest, assuming the requisite service period is rendered and the probable outcome of the performance condition is achieved. The estimate is revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of shares likely to vest differs from previous estimates. Expense is ultimately adjusted based on the actual achievement of service and performance targets. The Performance Shares will cliff vest 
100
% at the end of the third year following the grant in accordance with the performance metrics set forth.

In accordance with Topic 360, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis and also whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is generally based on discounted cash flows. Included in "General and administrative expenses" was $
521
 of restructuring-related impairment charges related to an asset that was held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2024. Included in “General and administrative expenses” were restructuring-related impairment and asset disposal charges of $
7,764
 related to building, equipment, and construction in progress mainly in the Human Nutrition and Health and the Animal Nutrition and Health segments for the year ended December 31, 2023. Such expenses were

NOTE 7 – 
EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENT
In 2013, the Company and Eastman Chemical Company formed a joint venture (
66.66
% / 
33.34
% ownership), St. Gabriel CC Company, LLC, to design, develop, and construct an expansion of the Company’s St. Gabriel aqueous choline chloride plant. The Company contributed the St. Gabriel plant, at cost, and all continued expansion and improvements are funded by the owners. The joint venture became operational as of July 1, 2016. St. Gabriel CC Company, LLC is a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") because the total equity at risk is not sufficient to permit the joint venture to finance its own activities without additional subordinated financial support. Additionally, voting rights (
2
 votes each) are not proportionate to the owners’ obligation to absorb expected losses or receive the expected residual returns of the joint venture. The Company generally receives up to 2/3 of the production offtake capacity, which (percentage of offtake) may be adjusted from time to time to the extent the owners agree as such, and absorbs operating expenses approximately proportional to the actual percentage of offtake. The joint venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting since the Company is not the primary beneficiary as the Company does not have the power to direct the activities of the joint venture that most significantly impact its economic performance. The Company recognized a loss of $
489
, $
509
, and $
559
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, relating to its portion of the joint venture’s expenses in other expense. The Company made capital contributions to the investment totaling $
269
, $
290
, and $
355
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively. The carrying value of the joint venture at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
3,856
 and $
4,076
, respectively, and is recorded in "Other non-current assets" on the consolidated balance sheets.
NOTE 8 – 
REVOLVING LOAN
On July 27, 2022, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "2022 Credit Agreement") with certain lenders in the form of a senior secured revolving credit facility, due on July 27, 2027. The 2022 Credit Agreement allows for up to $
550,000
 of borrowing. The loans may be used for working capital, letters of credit, and other corporate purposes and may be drawn upon at the Company's discretion. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total balance outstanding on the 2022 Credit Agreement amounted to $
190,000
 and $
309,569
, respectively. There are no installment payments required on the revolving loans; they may be voluntarily prepaid in whole or in part without premium or penalty, and all outstanding amounts are due on the maturity date.
Amounts outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement are subject to an interest rate equal to a fluctuating rate as defined by the 2022 Credit Agreement plus an applicable rate. The applicable rate is based upon the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio, as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement, and the interest rate was 
5.438
% at December 31, 2024. The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan, which is based on the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement and ranges from 
0.150
% to 
0.225
% (
0.150
% at December 31, 2024). The unused portion of the revolving loan amounted to $
360,000
 at December 31, 2024. The Company is also required to pay, as applicable, letter of credit fees, administrative agent fees, and other fees to the arrangers and lenders.
Costs associated with the issuance of the revolving loans are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the 2022 Credit Agreement. Capitalized costs net of accumulated amortization totaled $
743
 and $
1,030
 at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included in "Other non-current assets" on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense pertaining to these costs totaled $
287
, $
287
, and $
335
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and are included in "Interest expense" in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
The 2022 Credit Agreement contains quarterly covenants requiring the consolidated leverage ratio to be less than a certain maximum ratio and the consolidated interest coverage ratio to exceed a certain minimum ratio. At December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. Indebtedness under the Company’s loan agreements is secured by assets of the Company.

NOTE 10 - 
INCOME TAXES
The Company’s effective tax rate for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was

22.8
%, 
20.9
%
, and 
21.2
%, respectively
. The increase from 2023 to 2024 is primarily due to an increase in certain foreign taxes.
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and would establish a valuation allowance if it believed that such assets may not be recovered, taking into consideration historical operating results, expectations of future earnings, changes in its operations and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences.
The Company considers the undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and the Company's specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. In 2023, due to prevailing economic conditions of increased interest rates and subsequent borrowing costs, the Company remitted approximately $
18,000
 from its Belgium subsidiary and incurred an income tax expense of approximately $
20
 in the year ended December 31, 2023. The remittance was used to pay down U.S. debt. There was 
no
 such remittance during the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company projects that its foreign earnings will be utilized offshore for working capital and future foreign growth. The determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those undistributed earnings is not practicable due to its legal entity structure and the complexity of U.S. and local country tax laws. If the Company decides to change its assertion on its remaining undistributed foreign earnings, it will need to recognize the income tax effects in the period it changes its assertion.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company has state income tax net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $
314
. The state NOL carryforwards will expire between 2026 and 2035. The Company believes that the benefit from the state NOL carryforwards will not be realized, therefore, a valuation allowance has been established in the amount of $

.
Provisions of ASC 740-10 clarify whether or not to recognize assets or liabilities for tax positions taken that may be challenged by a tax authority.

All of Balchem's unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized in future periods, would impact the Company's effective tax rate in such future periods. 
The Company recognizes both interest and penalties as part of the income tax provision. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, these amounts were increased by $
939
 and reduced by $
322
, and $
371
, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accrued interest and penalties were $
2,352
 and $
1,413
, respectively.
Balchem files income tax returns in the U.S. and in various states and foreign countries. In the major jurisdictions where the Company operates, it is generally no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2020 and management does not anticipate any material change in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to occur within the next twelve months.
The European Union (“EU”) member states formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which was established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Pillar Two generally provides for a 15 percent minimum effective tax rate for the jurisdictions where multinational enterprises operate. While the Company does not anticipate that this will have a material impact on its tax provision or effective tax rate, the Company continues to monitor evolving tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
NOTE 11 - 
SEGMENT INFORMATION
Balchem Corporation reports 
three
 reportable segments: Human Nutrition and Health, Animal Nutrition and Health, and Specialty Products. The reportable segments are organized based on the end use of the products manufactured and sold. Sales and production of products outside of our reportable segments and other minor business activities are included in "Other and Unallocated."
Human Nutrition and Health
The Human Nutrition and Health ("HNH") segment provides human grade choline nutrients and mineral amino acid chelated products through this segment for nutrition and health applications. Choline is recognized to play a key role in the development and structural integrity of brain cell membranes in infants, processing dietary fat, reproductive development and neural functions, such as memory and muscle function. The Company's mineral amino acid chelates, specialized mineral salts, and mineral complexes are used as raw materials for inclusion in premier human nutrition products; proprietary technologies have been combined to create an organic molecule in a form the body can readily assimilate. Sales growth for human nutrition applications is reliant on differentiation from lower-cost competitive products through scientific data, intellectual property and customers' appreciation of brand value. Consequently, the Company makes investments in such activities for long-term value differentiation.  This segment also manufactures specialty vitamin K2, which plays a crucial role in the human body for bone health, heart health and immunity, and methylsulfonylmethane ("MSM"), which is a widely used nutritional ingredient that helps provide benefits for joint health, sports nutrition, skin and beauty, and healthy aging. This segment also serves the food and beverage industry for beverage, bakery, dairy, confectionary, and savory manufacturers. The Company partners with its customers from ideation through commercialization to bring on-trend beverages, baked goods, confections, dairy and meat products to market. The Company has expertise in trends analysis and product development. With its strong manufacturing capabilities in customized spray dried and emulsified powders, extrusion and agglomeration, blended lipid systems, liquid flavor delivery systems, juice and dairy bases, chocolate systems, ice cream bases and variegates, the Company is a one-stop solutions provider for beverage and 
54
Table of Contents
dairy product development needs. Additionally, this segment provides microencapsulation solutions to a variety of applications in food, pharmaceutical and nutritional ingredients to enhance performance of nutritional fortification, processing, mixing, and packaging applications and shelf-life. Major product applications are baked goods, refrigerated and frozen dough systems, processed meats, seasoning blends, confections, sports and protein bars, dietary plans, and nutritional supplements. The Company also creates cereal systems for ready-to-eat cereals, grain-based snacks, and cereal based ingredients.
Animal Nutrition and Health
The Animal Nutrition and Health ("ANH") segment provides nutritional products derived from its microencapsulation and chelation technologies in addition to the essential nutrient choline chloride. For ruminant animals, the Company’s microencapsulated products boost health and milk production by delivering nutrient supplements that are biologically available, providing required nutritional levels. The Company’s proprietary chelation technology provides enhanced nutrient absorption for various species of production and companion animals and is marketed for use in animal feed throughout the world. ANH also manufactures and supplies choline chloride, an essential nutrient for monogastric animal health, predominantly to the poultry, pet and swine industries. Choline, which is manufactured and sold in both dry and aqueous forms, plays a vital role in the metabolism of fat. In poultry, choline deficiency can result in reduced growth rates and perosis in young birds, while in swine production choline is a necessary and required component of gestating and lactating sow diets for both liver health and prevention of leg deformity. This segment also manufactures MSM, which is a widely used nutritional ingredient that provides benefits for pet health.
Sales of value-added encapsulated products are highly dependent on overall industry economics as well as the Company's ability to leverage the results of university and field research on the animal health and production benefits of our products. Management believes that success in the commodity-oriented choline chloride marketplace is highly dependent on the Company’s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent product quality and customer service. The Company continues to drive production efficiencies in order to maintain its competitive-cost position to effectively compete in a competitive global marketplace.
Specialty Products
The Specialty Products segment ("SP") re-packages and distributes a number of performance gases and chemicals for various uses by its customers, notably ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and ammonia. Ethylene oxide is sold as a sterilant gas, primarily for use in the health care industry. It is used to sterilize a wide range of medical devices because of its versatility and effectiveness in treating hard or soft surfaces, composites, metals, tubing and different types of plastics without negatively impacting the performance of the device being sterilized. Contract sterilizers and medical device manufacturers are principal customers for this product. Propylene oxide is marketed and sold as a fumigant to aid in the control of insects and microbiological spoilage, to reduce bacterial and mold contamination in certain shelled and processed nut meats, processed spices, cacao beans, cocoa powder, raisins, figs and prunes, and for various chemical synthesis applications, such as increasing paint durability and manufacturing specialty starches and textile coatings. Ammonia is used primarily as a refrigerant, for heat treatment of metals and various chemical synthesis applications, and is distributed in reusable and recyclable drum and cylinder packaging approved for use in the countries these products are shipped to.
The Company’s performance gases and chemicals are distributed worldwide in specially designed, reusable and recyclable drum and cylinder packaging, to assure compliance with safety, quality and environmental standards as outlined by the applicable regulatory agencies in the countries our products are shipped to. The Company’s inventory of these specially built drums and cylinders, along with its five filling facilities, represents a significant capital investment. The Company also sells single use canisters for use in sterilizing re-usable devices typically processed in autoclave units in hospitals. 
The Company’s micronutrient agricultural nutrition business sells chelated minerals primarily to producers of high value crops. The Company has a unique and patented two-step approach to solving mineral deficiency in plants to optimize health, yield and shelf-life. First, the Company determines optimal mineral balance for plant health. The Company then has a foliar applied Metalosate
®
 product range, utilizing patented amino acid chelate technology. Its products quickly and efficiently deliver mineral nutrients. As a result, the farmer/grower gets healthier crops that are more resistant to disease and pests, larger yields and healthier food for the consumer with extended shelf life for produce being shipped long distances.
The Company's CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM receives a profit and loss reporting package which provides segment information including revenue, cost of goods sold, gross margin, total operating expenses, and earnings from operations. The CODM utilizes this monthly profit and loss reporting package to analyze segment performance and appropriately allocate resources.

Product Sales Revenues
The Company’s primary operation is the manufacturing and sale of health and wellness ingredient products, in which the Company receives an order from a customer and fulfills that order. The Company’s product sales are considered point-in-time revenue.
Royalty Revenues
Royalty revenue consists of agreements with customers to use the Company’s intellectual property in exchange for a sales-based royalty. Royalties are considered over time revenue and are recorded in the HNH segment.
Contract Liabilities
The Company records contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance, including amounts which are refundable.
The Company’s payment terms vary by the type and location of customers and the products offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, the Company requires payment before the products are delivered to the customer.
Practical Expedients and Exemptions
The Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling and marketing expenses.
The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for products shipped.

two
 unfunded postretirement medical plans; one that is under a collective bargaining agreement and covers eligible retired employees of the Verona, Missouri facility and a plan for executive officers of the Company who meet eligibility requirements as set forth in the Company's Officer Retiree Program. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for its postretirement medical plans. In accordance with ASC 715, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits,” the Company is required to recognize the over funded or underfunded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position, and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. 
The actuarial recorded liabilities for such unfunded postretirement benefits are as follows:

Defined Benefit Pension Plans
The Company contributes to 
one
 multi-employer defined benefit plan under the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement covering its union-represented employees of the Verona, Missouri facility. The risks of participation in this multiemployer plan are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects: (a) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (b) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, and (c) if the Company was to stop participating in its multiemployer plan, the Company would be required to pay that plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as the withdrawal liability.
The Company’s participation in this plan for the annual period ended December 31, 2024 is outlined in the table below. The “EIN/Pension Plan Number” column provides the Employee Identification Number (EIN). The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan and is certified by the plan’s actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone or critical and declining zone are generally less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded. The “FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented” column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration date of the collective-bargaining agreement to which the plan is subject. Finally, the period-to-period comparability of the contributions for 2024 and 2023 was affected by a 
4.0
% increase in the 2024 contribution rate. There have been no other significant changes that affect the comparability of 2024 and 2023 contributions. The Company does not represent more than 5% of the contributions to this pension fund.

Deferred Compensation Plan
The Company maintains an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees. Assets of the plan are held in a rabbi trust, which are subject to additional risk of loss in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. The deferred compensation liability was $
11,470
 as of December 31, 2024, of which $
11,449
 was included in "Other long-term obligations" and $
21
 was included in "Accrued compensation and other benefits" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The deferred compensation liability was $
10,188
 as of December 31, 2023 and was included in "Other long-term obligations" on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.  The related assets of the irrevocable trust funds (also known as "rabbi trust funds") were $
11,465
 and $
10,188
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were included in "Other non-current assets" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.
NOTE 16 - 
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is obligated to make rental payments under non-cancelable operating and finance leases. Aggregate future minimum rental payments required under these leases at December 31, 2024 are disclosed in Note 19, 
Leases
.
The Company’s Verona, Missouri facility, while held by a prior owner, Syntex Agribusiness, Inc. (“Syntex”), was designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") as a Superfund site and placed on the National Priorities List in 1983 because of dioxin contamination on portions of the site. Remediation was conducted by Syntex under the oversight of the EPA and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. The Company is indemnified by the sellers under its May 2001 asset purchase agreement covering its acquisition of the Verona, Missouri facility for potential liabilities associated with the Superfund site. One of the sellers, in turn, has the benefit of certain contractual indemnification by Syntex in relation to the implementation of the above-described Superfund remedy. In June 2023, in response to a Special Notice Letter received from the EPA in 2022, BCP Ingredients, Inc. ("BCP"), the Company's subsidiary that operates the site, Syntex, EPA, and the State of Missouri entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (“ASAOC”) for a focused remedial investigation/feasibility study ("RI/FS") under which (a) BCP will conduct a source investigation of potential source(s) of releases of 1,4-dioxane and chlorobenzene at a portion of the site and (b) BCP and Syntex will complete a RI/FS to determine a potential remedy, if any is required. Activities under the ASAOC are underway and are expected to continue for some period of time.
Separately, in June 2022, the EPA conducted an inspection of BCP’s Verona, Missouri facility (“2022 EPA Inspection”) which was followed by BCP entering into an Administrative Order for Compliance on Consent (“AOC”) with the EPA in relation to its risk management program at the Verona facility. Further, in January 2023, BCP entered into an Amended AOC with the EPA 
Table of Contents
whereby the parties agreed to the extension of certain timelines. BCP timely completed all requirements under the Amended AOC. In November 2023, BCP received a notice from the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the U.S Department of Justice (“DOJ”) primarily related to the 2022 EPA Inspection, which extended the opportunity to discuss alleged violations of Sections 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act and regulations in 40 C.F.R. Part 68, commonly known as the Risk Management Plan Rule (“RMP Rule”). BCP participated in such discussions during 2024, and in December 2024, BCP reached a settlement with the EPA and DOJ to resolve these alleged violations. Pursuant to the settlement, which was entered into on January 31, 2025, BCP agreed to: (a) pay a $
300
 civil penalty; (b) invest in a new scrubber system; and (c) spend $
350
 to implement projects benefiting the surrounding community, such as emergency equipment for the local fire department and two vehicles to be used as mobile health clinics. The amount associated with this settlement was consistent with the amount previously accrued as a loss contingency.
In addition to the above, from time to time, the Company is a party to various legal proceedings, litigation, claims and assessments. While it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of each of these matters, management believes that the ultimate outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.
NOTE 17 – 
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company has a number of financial instruments, 
none
 of which are held for trading purposes. The Company estimates that the fair value of all financial instruments at December 31, 2024 and 2023 does not differ materially from the aggregate carrying values of its financial instruments recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is necessarily required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value, and, accordingly, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The carrying value of debt approximates fair value as the interest rate is based on market and the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The Company’s financial instruments also include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, which are carried at cost and approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 and 2023 included $
1,040
 and $
959
 in money market funds and other interest-bearing deposit accounts, respectively. 
Non-current assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 included $
11,465
 and $
10,188
, respectively, of rabbi trust funds related to the Company's deferred compensation plan. The money market and rabbi trust funds are valued using level one inputs, as defined by ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement.”
NOTE 18 – 
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company provides services under a contractual agreement to St. Gabriel CC Company, LLC. These services include accounting, information technology, quality control, and purchasing services, as well as operation of the St. Gabriel CC Company, LLC plant. The Company also sells raw materials to St. Gabriel CC Company, LLC. These raw materials are used in the production of finished goods that are, in turn, sold by Saint Gabriel CC Company, LLC to the Company for resale to unrelated parties. As such, the sale of these raw materials to St. Gabriel CC Company, LLC in this scenario lacks economic substance and therefore the Company does not include them in net sales within the consolidated statements of earnings. 
Payments for the services the Company provided amounted to $
4,425
, $
4,363
, and $
4,213
, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. The raw materials purchased and subsequently sold amounted to $
29,795
, $
34,219
, and $
39,853
, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. These services and raw materials are primarily recorded in cost of goods sold, net of the finished goods received from St. Gabriel CC Company, LLC of $
22,940
, $
28,099
, and $
29,062
, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had receivables of $
3,893
 and $
8,314
, respectively, recorded in accounts receivable from St. Gabriel CC Company, LLC for services rendered and raw materials sold. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had payables of $
2,831
 and $
6,050
, respectively, recorded in accounts payable for finished goods received from St. Gabriel CC Company, LLC. In addition, the Company had payables in the amount of $
296
 and $
329
, respectively, related to non-contractual monies owed to St. Gabriel CC Company, LLC, recorded in accounts payable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

NOTE 19 – 
LEASES
The Company has both real estate leases and equipment leases. The main types of equipment leases include forklifts, trailers, printers and copiers, railcars, and trucks. Leases are categorized as both operating leases and finance leases. As a result of electing the practical expedient within ASU 2016-02, variable lease payments are combined and recognized on the balance sheet in the event that those charges and any related increases are explicitly stated in the lease. Such payments include common area maintenance charges, property taxes, and insurance charges and are recorded in the right of use asset and corresponding liability when the payments are stated in the lease with (a) fixed or in-substance fixed amounts, or (b) a variable payment based on an index or rate. Due to the acquisitive nature of the Company and the potential for synergies upon integration of acquired entities, the Company determined that the reasonably certain criterion could not be met for any renewal periods beginning 
two years
 from December 31, 2024. In addition, the Company has historically not been exercising purchase options under the equipment leases as it does not make economic sense to buy the equipment. Instead, the Company has historically replaced the equipment with new leases. Therefore, the Company determined that the reasonably certain criterion could not be met as it relates to purchase options. The Company has no residual value guarantees in lease transactions. 
The Company did not identify any embedded leases. As indicated above, the Company elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components and recognizes the combined amount on the consolidated balance sheet. Management determined that since the Company has a centralized treasury function, the parent company would either fund or guarantee a subsidiary's loan for borrowing over a similar term. As such, the Company's management determined it is appropriate to utilize a corporate based borrowing rate for all locations. The Company developed 
four
 tranches of leases based on lease terms and these tranches reflect the composition of the current lease portfolio. The Company's borrowing history shows that interest rates of a term loan or a line of credit depend on the duration of the loan rather than the nature of the assets purchased by those funds. Based on this understanding, the Company elected to use a portfolio approach to discount rates, applying corporate rates to the tranches of leases based on lease terms. Based on the Company's risk rating, the company applied the following discount rates for new leases entered into during 2024: (1)

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.    
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
As of December 31, 2024, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework (New Framework) to conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm
The independent registered public accounting firm of RSM US LLP has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There has been no significant change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
