Performance Graph
The graph below sets forth the cumulative total stockholder return on the Common Stock (referred to in the table as “BCPC”) for the five years ended December 31, 2024, the overall stock market return during such period for shares comprising the Russell 2000
®
 Index (which we believe includes companies with market capitalization similar to that of us), and the overall stock market return during such period for shares comprising the Dow Jones U.S. Specialty Chemicals Index, in each case assuming a comparable initial investment of $100 on December 31, 2019 and the subsequent reinvestment of dividends. The Russell 2000
®
 Index measures the performance of the shares of the 2000 smallest companies included in the Russell 3000
®
 Index. In light of our industry segments, we do not believe that published industry-specific indices are necessarily representative of stocks comparable to us. Nevertheless, we consider the Dow Jones U.S. Specialty Chemicals Index to be potentially useful as a peer group index with respect to us. The performance of the Common Stock shown on the graph below is historical only and not necessarily indicative of future performance.
