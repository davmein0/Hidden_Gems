We have offices in Herzliya, Israel where we employ the majority of our research and development team and a portion of our support and general and administrative teams. We also have offices in North Carolina and Cork, Ireland which serve as our primary U.S. and EMEA customer support and inside sales center, respectively. Additionally, we have offices in New York and Florida and smaller offices in Arizona, France, the United Kingdom, Oregon, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore and Luxembourg which serve as regional sales offices and some of which are customer support centers. Our office space is primarily leased, the majority of which is under long-term leases with varying expiration dates. We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs in the near future.
