MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion relates to APA Corporation (APA or the Company) and its consolidated subsidiaries and should be read together in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the risk factors and related information set forth in Part I, Item 1A and Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are incorporated by reference to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of APA Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024).
Overview
APA is an independent energy company that owns subsidiaries that explore for, develop, and produce crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs). The Company’s business has oil and gas operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). APA also has active development, exploration, and appraisal operations ongoing in Suriname, as well as exploration interests in Uruguay, Alaska, and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. As a holding company, APA Corporation’s primary assets are its ownership interests in its consolidated subsidiaries.
APA believes energy underpins global progress, and the Company wants to be a part of the solution as society works to meet growing global demand for reliable and affordable energy. APA strives to meet those challenges while creating value for all its stakeholders.
Uncertainties in the global supply chain and financial markets, including the impact of ongoing international conflicts, inflation, trade disputes, and actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including OPEC+, impact oil supply and demand and contribute to commodity price volatility. Despite these uncertainties, the Company remains committed to its longer-term objectives: (1) to invest for long-term returns in pursuit of moderate, sustainable production growth; (2) to strengthen the balance sheet to underpin the generation of cash flow in excess of its upstream exploration, appraisal, and development capital program that can be directed to debt reduction, share repurchases, and other return of capital to its shareholders; and (3) to responsibly manage its cost structure regardless of the oil price environment. 
The Company closely monitors hydrocarbon pricing fundamentals to reallocate capital as part of its ongoing planning process. APA’s diversified asset portfolio and operational flexibility provide the Company the ability to timely respond to near-term price volatility and effectively manage its investment programs accordingly. For example, the Company curtailed production in the Permian Basin in the second half of 2024 in response to weakness in Waha natural gas and NGL prices; however, in Egypt, the Company contracted an additional drilling rig in late 2024 after signing an agreement to incentivize gas exploration and production at new pricing. In 2023, the Company decided to suspend drilling activity in the North Sea, as increasing cost and tax burdens impacted the competitiveness of these assets within the Company’s portfolio. Capital investment plans have accordingly been aligned across other areas of the portfolio while maintaining a focus on the Company’s capital returns framework.
The Company remains committed to its capital return framework for equity holders to participate more directly and materially in cash returns.
•
The Company believes returning 60 percent of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases creates a good balance for providing near-term cash returns to shareholders while still recognizing the importance of longer-term balance sheet strengthening.
•
The Company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share on its common stock.  
•
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 and through the end of 2024, the Company has repurchased 85.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Subsequent to year-end 2024 and through the date of this filing on February 28, 2025, the Company repurchased 3.9 million shares, and as of February 28, 2025, the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 30.9 million shares under the Company’s share repurchase programs.
34
Financial and Operational Highlights
During 2024, the Company reported net income attributable to common stock of $804 million, or $2.27 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.9 billion, or $9.25 per diluted share, in 2023. Net income in 2024 was primarily impacted by impairments of $1.1 billion, which included oil and gas property impairments of $796 million in the North Sea and $315 million in the U.S., and lower realized crude oil and natural gas prices during the year compared to 2023. The Company also recorded higher oil and gas revenues and associated operating expenses resulting from the Callon acquisition.
The Company generated $3.6 billion of cash from operating activities in 2024, which was $491 million or 16 percent higher than 2023. APA’s higher operating cash flows for 2024 were primarily driven by higher oil and gas revenues resulting from increased drilling activity in the Permian Basin and production from the acquired Callon properties, partially offset by lower realized commodity prices. The Company repurchased 9.2 million shares of its common stock for $246 million and paid $353 million in dividends to APA common stockholders during 2024.
Key operational highlights for the year include:
United States
•
Daily boe production from the Company’s U.S. assets, which increased 30 percent from 2023, accounted for 62 percent of the Company’s worldwide production during 2024. The Company averaged nine drilling rigs in the U.S. during the year, including five rigs in the Southern Midland Basin and four rigs in the Delaware Basin, and drilled and brought online 159 operated wells in 2024. The Company’s drilling was primarily focused on oil prospects, and combined with the Callon acquisition, oil production increased approximately 63 percent in the U.S. compared to the prior year. The Company’s core Permian Basin development program continues to represent key growth areas for the U.S. assets. 
•
During the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed a three-well exploration program in Alaska, confirming a working petroleum system on the Company’s acreage. The Company is currently drilling an additional exploration well on this acreage. The Company holds a 50 percent ownership interest in the project.
International
•
In Egypt, the Company continued its drilling and workover activity with a focus on oil prospects. The Company averaged 14 drilling rigs and drilled 62 new productive wells during 2024. During the same period, the Company averaged 20 workover rigs as it continues to align its drilling and workover activity with a goal of driving improved capital efficiency. The 2024 gross and net production from the Company’s Egypt assets decreased 6 percent and 4 percent, respectively, from 2023.
•
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a new gas sales agreement which could result in improved pricing if certain production thresholds are met. The new gas sales agreement creates the potential for significant new drilling inventory with returns on par with oil.
•
During the second quarter of 2023, the Company suspended all new drilling activity in the North Sea. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company continued its economic assessment of its North Sea assets in light of several new regulatory guidelines and obligations surrounding significant tax levies and modernization of aging infrastructure. The Company determined the expected returns do not economically support making investments required under the combined impact of the regulations, and it will cease production at its facilities in the North Sea prior to 2030. The Company’s investment program in the North Sea is now directed toward asset safety and integrity.
•
In October 2024, the Company announced that its subsidiary reached a positive final investment decision for the first oil development, named GranMorgu, in Block 58 offshore Suriname. This development will include production from the Krabdagu and Sapakara oil discoveries. These fields, located in water depths between 100 and 1,000 meters, will be produced through a system of subsea wells connected to a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit located 150 km off the Suriname coast, with an oil production capacity of 220,000 barrels per day. The GranMorgu FPSO unit is designed to accommodate future tie-back opportunities that would extend its 4-year production plateau and will feature technology that minimizes greenhouse gas emissions. Total investment is estimated at $10.5 billion, with APA’s share of the investment subject to the existing agreement with TotalEnergies to carry a portion of Apache’s appraisal and development capital. First oil is anticipated in 2028.

35
Acquisition and Divestiture Activity
Over the Company’s history, it has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes in its industry and economic conditions. A key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize APA’s portfolio of assets in response to these changes. Most recently, the Company has completed a series of acquisitions and divestitures designed to enhance the Company’s portfolio and monetize nonstrategic assets in order to allocate resources to more impactful exploration and development opportunities. These acquisitions and divestitures include:
•
Callon Petroleum Company Acquisition  
On April 1, 2024, APA completed its acquisition of Callon Petroleum Company (Callon) in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $4.5 billion, inclusive of Callon’s debt (the Callon acquisition). The acquired assets include approximately 120,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin and 25,000 net acres in the Midland Basin. The Company believes the acquisition of Callon provides opportunities to reduce costs, improve capital efficiencies, leverage economies of scale, and expand the development inventory that formed the basis of the transaction value. 
•
Sale of Non-core Permian Basin Properties
  On December 31, 2024, APA completed the sale of non-core producing properties in the Permian Basin that had a carrying value of $1.1 billion and associated asset retirement obligation of $224 million for total cash proceeds of $869 million after closing adjustments. The properties are located in the Central Basin Platform, Texas and New Mexico Shelf, and Northwest Shelf.
•
Non-core Acreage Divestiture 
 During 2024, the Company completed the sale of non-core acreage in the East Texas Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford plays that had a carrying value of $347 million for aggregate cash proceeds of $255 million and the assumption of asset retirement obligations of $42 million.
•
Mineral Rights Divestiture
  During 2024, the Company also completed the sale of non-core mineral and royalty interests in the Permian Basin that had a carrying value of $71 million for approximately $394 million subject to post-closing adjustments.
•
Sales of Kinetik Shares
  During 2022 and 2023, the Company sold a portion of its Kinetik Shares for cash proceeds of $224 million and $228 million, respectively. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company sold its remaining shares of Kinetik Class A Common Stock for cash proceeds of $428 million. On April 3, 2024, the Company’s designated director resigned from the Kinetik Holdings, Inc. (Kinetik) board of directors.

Crude Oil Prices  
A substantial portion of the Company’s crude oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the Company’s control. Average realized crude oil prices for 2024 were down 3 percent compared to 2023, a direct result of decreasing benchmark oil prices over the past year. Crude oil prices realized in 2024 averaged $78.08 per barrel.
Continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of the Company’s asset portfolio. While the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a global market. Prices for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction.
Natural Gas Prices  
Natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. The Company’s primary markets include North America, Egypt, and the U.K. An overview of the market conditions in the Company’s primary gas-producing regions follows:
•
The Company sells its U.S. natural gas production at liquid index sales points within the U.S., at either monthly or daily index-based prices. The Company’s U.S. realizations averaged $0.71 per Mcf in 2024, a 61 percent decrease from an average of $1.80 per Mcf in 2023.
•
In Egypt, the Company’s natural gas is sold to EGPC, primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. Overall, the Company’s Egypt operations averaged $2.94 per Mcf in 2024, a one percent increase from an average of $2.91 per Mcf in 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a new gas sales agreement, which could result in improved pricing if certain production thresholds are met. The new gas sales agreement, which is effective beginning January 2025, creates the potential for significant new drilling inventory with returns on par with oil.
•
Natural gas from the North Sea Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The Company’s North Sea operations averaged $10.84 per Mcf in 2024, a 17 percent decrease from an average of $13.02 per Mcf in 2023.
39
NGL Prices  
The Company’s U.S. NGL production, which accounted for 98 percent of the Company’s total 2024 NGL production, is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on Gulf Coast supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.
Crude Oil Revenues
Crude oil revenues for 2024 totaled $7.0 billion, a $969 million increase from the 2023 total of $6.0 billion. A 20 percent higher average daily production increased 2024 revenues by $1.2 billion compared to 2023, while a 3 percent decrease in average realized prices reduced revenues by $196 million. Average daily production in 2024 was 244 Mb/d, with prices averaging $78.08 per barrel. Crude oil sales accounted for 85 percent of the Company’s 2024 oil and gas production revenues and 54 percent of its worldwide production.
The Company’s worldwide crude oil production increased 41 Mb/d compared to 2023, primarily a result of increased drilling activity in the Permian Basin coupled with the Callon acquisition. These increases were partially offset by natural production decline across all assets, the sale of non-core assets in the U.S., and operational downtime due to maintenance activities in the North Sea.
Natural Gas Revenues
Natural gas revenues for 2024 totaled $584 million, a $296 million decrease from the 2023 total of $880 million. A 32 percent decrease in average realized prices reduced 2024 revenues by $285 million compared to 2023, while 2 percent lower average daily production decreased revenues by $11 million. Average daily production in 2024 was 814 MMcf/d, with prices averaging $1.97 per Mcf. Natural gas sales accounted for 7 percent of the Company’s 2024 oil and gas production revenues and 30 percent of its worldwide production.
The Company’s worldwide natural gas production decreased 14 MMcf/d compared to 2023, primarily a result of natural production decline in the North Sea and U.S., reduced gas-focused activity in Egypt, curtailment of volumes at Alpine High in response to extreme Waha basis differentials, and the sale of non-core assets in the U.S. These decreases were partially offset by increased drilling activity in the Permian Basin coupled with the Callon acquisition.
NGL Revenues
NGL revenues for 2024 totaled $646 million, a $138 million increase from the 2023 total of $508 million. A 17 percent higher average daily production increased 2024 revenues by $95 million compared to 2023, while an 8 percent increase in average realized prices increased 2024 revenues by $43 million. Average daily production in 2024 was 75 Mb/d, with prices averaging $23.37 per barrel. NGL sales accounted for 8 percent of the Company’s 2024 oil and gas production revenues and 16 percent of its worldwide production.
The Company’s worldwide NGL production increased 11 Mb/d compared to 2023, primarily a result of increased drilling activity in the Permian Basin coupled with the Callon acquisition, partially offset by natural production decline in the U.S., curtailment of volumes at Alpine High in response to extreme Waha basis differentials, and the sale of non-core assets in the U.S.
Purchased Oil and Gas Sales
Purchased oil and gas sales represent volumes primarily attributable to domestic gas purchases that were sold by the Company to fulfill natural gas takeaway obligations and delivery commitments. Sales related to purchased volumes increased $647 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 to $1.5 billion from $894 million in 2023. Purchased oil and gas sales were partially offset by associated purchase costs of $1.0 billion and $742 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in purchased oil and gas sales was primarily driven by increased oil volume sales coupled with activity associated with the Callon acquisition.

Lease Operating Expenses (LOE)

LOE includes several key components, such as direct operating costs, repairs and maintenance, and workover costs. Direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. They directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. Crude oil, which accounted for 54 percent of the Company’s total 2024 production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. Repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties.
During 2024, LOE increased $254 million, or 18 percent, compared to 2023. On a per-boe basis, LOE increased $0.48, or 5 percent, compared to 2023, from $9.68 per boe to $10.16 per boe. The increase in absolute costs was primarily driven by higher operating and labor costs and workover activity associated with the Callon acquisition. The Company also had higher labor costs and other operating costs trending with general inflation across all regions, which were partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar.
41
Gathering, Processing, and Transmission (GPT)
GPT expenses include amounts paid to third-party carriers for gathering and transmission services for the Company’s upstream natural gas production. Prior to the BCP Business Combination and the Company’s deconsolidation of Altus on February 22, 2022, GPT expenses also included gathering and transmission services provided by Altus Midstream and midstream operating costs incurred by Altus.

GPT costs increased $98 million compared to 2023, primarily the result of increased oil and NGL production volumes in the U.S., primarily associated with the Callon acquisition, as well as increased charges for transporting gas production.
Purchased Oil and Gas Costs

Purchased oil and gas costs increased $305 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, to $1.0 billion from $742 million in 2023. The increase is primarily driven by increased oil volume purchases coupled with activity associated with the Callon acquisition during 2024, partially offset by lower average natural gas prices during 2024 compared to the prior-year period. With widening margins under third-party gas agreements, purchased oil and gas costs were more than offset by associated sales to fulfill natural gas takeaway obligations and delivery commitments totaling $1.5 billion for the year ended 2024, as discussed above.
Taxes Other Than Incom
e
Taxes other than income primarily consist of severance taxes on onshore properties and in state waters off the coast of the U.S. and ad valorem taxes on U.S. properties. Severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues. The Company is also subject to a variety of other taxes, including U.S. franchise taxes.
Taxes other than income increased $63 million compared to 2023, primarily from higher severance taxes driven by increased U.S. production volumes primarily attributable to the Callon acquisition.
Exploration Expenses
Exploration expenses include unproved leasehold impairments, exploration dry hole expense, geological and geophysical expenses, and the costs of maintaining and retaining unproved leasehold properties. The following table presents a summary of these expenses:

Exploration expenses increased $118 million compared to 2023, primarily the result of dry hole expense associated with an exploration well in Suriname and the completion of an initial drilling campaign in Alaska, where two wells were unable to reach target objectives in the allotted seasonal time window.
42
General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses
G&A expenses increased $21 million compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher overall labor costs across the Company and the Callon acquisition, partially offset by lower cash-based stock compensation expense resulting from changes in the Company’s stock price in 2024. For additional information refer to 
Note 13—Capital Stock
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Transaction, Reorganization, and Separation (TRS) Costs
TRS costs increased $153 million compared to 2023, primarily a result of transaction costs related to the Callon acquisition coupled with separation costs in the North Sea. TRS costs incurred in 2024 primarily comprised $147 million associated with the Callon acquisition, including $76 million of separation costs and $71 million of transaction and integration costs.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A)
DD&A expenses on the Company’s oil and gas property for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $735 million compared to 2023. The Company’s oil and gas property DD&A rate increased $3.32 per boe in 2024 compared to 2023, from $10.12 per boe to $13.44 per boe, driven by negative gas price-related reserve revisions in the U.S. Permian Basin and impacts resulting from the Callon acquisition in 2024. The increase on an absolute basis was also driven by higher capital expenditures incurred in the U.S. and the Callon acquisition.
Impairments
During 2024, the Company recorded $1.1 billion of impairments, which included $796 million of oil and gas property impairments in the North Sea, a $315 million impairment of certain oil and gas properties in the U.S. to agreed-upon proceeds for their disposition, and $18 million of inventory impairments in the North Sea and U.S. During 2023, the Company recorded $61 million of impairments, primarily in connection with valuations of drilling and operations equipment inventory upon the Company’s decision to suspend drilling operations in the North Sea.

Provision for Income Taxes 

Income tax expense increased $741 million from an income tax benefit of $324 million during 2023 to an income tax expense of $417 million during 2024. The Company’s 2024 effective income tax rate was primarily impacted by taxes related to foreign operations. During 2023, the Company’s effective income tax rate was primarily impacted by a deferred tax benefit related to the release of a portion of its valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets and a deferred tax expense related to the remeasurement of taxes in the U.K. as a result of the enactment of Finance Act 2023 on January 10, 2023.
On July 14, 2022, the Energy (Oil and Gas) Profits Levy Act of 2022 (the Energy Profits Levy) was enacted, receiving Royal Assent. Under the law, an additional levy was assessed at a 25 percent rate, effective for the period of May 26, 2022 through December 31, 2025. The Finance Act 2023 included amendments to the Energy Profits Levy that increased the levy from a 25 percent rate to a 35 percent rate, effective for the period of January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2028. As a result, the Company recorded a deferred tax expense of $174 million and $208 million related to the remeasurement of the U.K. deferred tax liability in 2023 and 2022, respectively
.
On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The IRA includes a new 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on applicable corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income that exceeds $1.0 billion for any three consecutive years preceding the tax year at issue. The CAMT is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The Company became an applicable corporation subject to CAMT beginning on January 1, 2024. On September 12, 2024, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released proposed regulations relating to the application and implementation of CAMT. In 2024, the Company accrued tax expense of $74 million, which results in a tax credit that can be carried forward indefinitely to offset regular federal income tax expense in subsequent years.
In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development issued Pillar Two Model Rules introducing a new global minimum tax of 15 percent on a country-by-country basis, with certain aspects effective in certain jurisdictions on January 1, 2024. Although the Company continues to monitor enacted legislation to implement these rules in countries where the Company could be impacted, the Company does not expect that the Pillar Two framework will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recorded for future deductible amounts and certain other tax benefits, such as net operating losses, tax credits and other tax attributes, provided that the Company assesses the utilization of such assets to be “more likely than not.” The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the existing deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, the Company has recorded valuation allowances for certain net operating losses, foreign tax credits and capital loss carryforwards that it does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.
During the fourth quarter of 2023, as a result of increases in projections of future taxable income and the absence of objective negative evidence such as a cumulative loss in recent years, the Company determined there was sufficient positive evidence to release a majority of the U.S. valuation allowance, which resulted in a non-cash deferred income tax benefit of $1.7 billion.
For additional information regarding income taxes, refer to 
Note 10—Income Taxes
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income or capital taxes in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax reserves are related to tax years that may be subject to examination by the relevant taxing authority. The Company is under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and in various states and foreign jurisdictions as part of its normal course of business.
44
Capital and Operational Outlook
The Company continues to prudently manage its capital program against a volatile price environment and the effects of global inflation and rising interest rates. Despite these uncertainties, the Company remains committed to its longer-term objectives: (1) to invest for long-term returns in pursuit of moderate, sustainable production growth; (2) to strengthen the balance sheet to underpin the generation of cash flow in excess of its upstream exploration, appraisal, and development capital program that can be directed to debt reduction, share repurchases, and other return of capital to its shareholders; and (3) to responsibly manage its cost structure regardless of the oil price environment. 
In 2025, the Company plans to invest $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion in upstream capital investment. The Company is planning an 8-rig program in the Permian Basin, with approximately four rigs in each of the Midland and Delaware basins, and a 12-rig program in Egypt, with one rig dedicated to gas appraisal and exploration. This activity set translates to a combined development capital budget for the Permian Basin and Egypt of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. In addition, the Company will invest approximately $200 million for Suriname development and $100 million for exploration, primarily in Alaska. 
Based on this development capital budget, the Company anticipates production in 2025 to be slightly higher compared to 2024. This investment profile underscores the progress the Company has made on capital efficiency through the integration of Callon and stabilization of Egypt volumes. At current strip pricing, the Company expects to generate significant cash flow over this capital activity budget. The Company’s current commitment to return capital to shareholders through a mix of dividends and share buybacks remains unchanged.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of liquidity. The Company’s short-term and long-term operating cash flows are impacted by highly volatile commodity prices, as well as production costs and sales volumes. Significant changes in commodity prices impact the Company’s revenues, earnings, and cash flows. These changes potentially impact the Company’s liquidity if costs do not trend with sustained decreases in commodity prices. Historically, costs have trended with commodity prices, albeit on a lag. Sales volumes also impact cash flows; however, they have a less volatile impact in the short term.
The Company’s long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. Cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. Future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of the Company’s drilling program and its ability to add reserves economically. Changes in commodity prices also impact estimated quantities of proved reserves. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized downward reserve revisions related to decreases in commodity prices during the year. The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves, and PUD reserves as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in 
Note 17—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited)
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company believes its available liquidity and capital resource alternatives, combined with proactive measures to adjust its capital budget to reflect volatile commodity prices and anticipated operating cash flows, will be adequate to fund short-term and long-term operations, including the Company’s capital development program, repayment of debt maturities, payment of dividends, share buy-back activity, and amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies. 
The Company may also elect to utilize available cash on hand, committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.

The table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis; therefore, the amounts may differ from those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which include accruals.
Sources of Cash and Cash Equivalents
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities  
Operating cash flows are the Company’s primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short term and the long term, by volatile commodity prices. The factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as DD&A, exploratory dry hole expense, asset impairments, asset retirement obligation (ARO) accretion, and deferred income tax expense.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $3.6 billion, up $491 million from the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher oil and gas revenues resulting from increased drilling activity in the Permian Basin and production from the acquired Callon properties, partially offset by lower realized commodity prices.
For a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and operating expenses, refer to “Results of Operations” in this Item 7. For additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses that do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, refer to the 
Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows
 in the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Proceeds from Asset Divestitures
  The Company received $1.6 billion and $29 million in proceeds from the divestiture of certain non-core assets during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For more information regarding the Company’s divestitures, refer to 
Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
46
Proceeds from Term Loan Facility  
On April 1, 2024, the Company borrowed an aggregate $1.5 billion under a syndicated credit agreement. Loan proceeds were used to refinance certain indebtedness of Callon upon the closing of the Callon acquisition. For additional details of the credit agreement, see “
Unsecured Committed

Term Loan Facility” 
in the Liquidity section below. As of December 31, 2024, $900 million remained outstanding under the term loan facility governed by the Term Loan Credit Agreement.
Proceeds from Sale of Kinetik Shares
  The Company received $428 million and $228 million of cash proceeds from the sales of its Kinetik Shares during 2024 and 2023, respectively. For more information regarding the Company’s equity method interests, refer to 
Note 6—Equity Method Interests
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents
Additions to Oil & Gas Property 
 Exploration and development cash expenditures were $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is reflective of the Company’s acquisition of Callon, which increased the number of drilling rigs being operated in the Permian Basin, partially offset by the Company’s efforts to balance workover activity in Egypt and reduce drilling activity in the North Sea as it continually assesses inventory opportunities across its diverse portfolio in 2024. The Company operated an average of 22 drilling rigs during 2024, compared to an average of 24 drilling rigs during 2023. 
Leasehold and Property Acquisitions  
During 2024 and 2023, in addition to the Callon acquisition, the Company completed other leasehold and property acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, for total cash consideration of $60 million and $20 million, respectively.
Payments on Term Loan Facility  
During 2024, the Company made payments of $600 million on its syndicated term loan credit agreement. For additional details of the credit agreement, see “
Unsecured Committed Term Loan Facility” 
in the Liquidity section below. As of December 31, 2024, $900 million remained outstanding under the term loan facility governed by the Term Loan Credit Agreement.
Payments on Commercial Paper and Revolving Credit Facilities, Net
  As of December 31, 2024, outstanding borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper and U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facility were $333 million, a decrease of $40 million from December 31, 2023 as operating cash flows generated in 2024 were used to repay facility borrowings.
Payments on Callon Credit Agreement  
Upon closing of the Callon acquisition, the Company financed Callon’s repayment in full of its $472 million outstanding under the Callon Credit Agreement.
Payments on Fixed-Rate Debt  
In April and May of 2024, the Company financed Callon’s repayment pursuant to Callon’s cash tender offers for, and redemptions of all senior notes issued under Callon’s indentures for an aggregate cash payment of $1.6 billion, reflecting principal amounts, premium to par, and associated fees.
During 2023, Apache purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $74 million for an aggregate purchase price of $65 million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a discount to par of an aggregate $10 million. The Company recognized a $9 million gain on these repurchases. 
The Company may, and expects that Apache will continue to, reduce debt outstanding under its indentures from time to time.
Dividends Paid to APA Common Stockholders  
The Company paid $353 million and $308 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for dividends on its common stock.
Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest - Egypt  
Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) holds a one-third minority participation interest in the Company’s oil and gas operations in Egypt.

Debt  
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $6.0 billion in total debt outstanding, which consisted of notes and debentures of Apache, credit facility borrowings, and finance lease obligations. As of December 31, 2024, current debt included $53 million of finance lease obligations.
Unsecured 2022 Committed Bank Credit Facilities  
On April 29, 2022, the Company entered into two unsecured syndicated credit agreements for general corporate purposes that remained in effect as of December 31, 2024, but were replaced on January 15, 2025 as detailed below under “Subsequent Event — Unsecured 2025 Committed Bank Credit Facilities.” As of December 31, 2024:
•
One agreement was denominated in US dollars (the 2022 USD Agreement) and provides for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility, with aggregate commitments of US$1.8 billion (including a letter of credit subfacility of up to US$750 million, of which US$150 million was committed).
•
The second agreement was denominated in pounds sterling (the 2022 GBP Agreement) and provided for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility, with aggregate commitments of £1.5 billion for loans and letters of credit.
As of December 31, 2024, there were $10 million of borrowings under the 2022 USD Agreement and an aggregate £303 million in letters of credit outstanding under the GBP Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, there were no letters of credit outstanding under the USD Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, there were $372 million of borrowings under the 2022 USD Agreement, and an aggregate £348 million in letters of credit outstanding under the GBP Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, there were no letters of credit outstanding under the 2022 USD Agreement.
The Company was in compliance with the terms of the 2022 Agreements as of December 31, 2024.
There is no assurance of the terms upon which potential lenders under future credit facilities will make loans or other extensions of credit available to APA or its subsidiaries or the composition of such lenders. 
There is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to APA or its subsidiaries will not deteriorate. The Company closely monitors the ratings of the banks in its bank groups. Having large bank groups allows the Company to mitigate the potential impact of any bank’s failure to honor its lending commitment.
Uncommitted Lines of Credit  
Each of the Company and Apache from time to time has and uses uncommitted credit and letter of credit facilities for working capital and credit support purposes. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities. As of December 31, 2024, there were £640 million and $11 million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities. As of December 31, 2023, there were £416 million and $2 million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities.
48
Commercial Paper Program

In December 2023, the Company established a commercial paper program under which it from time to time may issue in private placements exempt from registration under the Securities Act short-term unsecured promissory notes (the CP Notes) up to a maximum aggregate face amount of $1.8 billion outstanding at any time. The maturities of the CP Notes may vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. Outstanding CP Notes are supported by available borrowing capacity under the Company’s committed revolving credit facilities for general corporate purposes, which as of December 31, 2024, included the $1.8 billion 2022 USD Agreement.
Payment of the CP Notes has been unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Apache, such guarantee effective until the first time that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures is less than US$1.0 billion.
The CP Notes are sold under customary market terms in the U.S. commercial paper market at a discount from par or at par and bear interest at rates determined at the time of issuance.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $323 million in aggregate face amount of CP Notes outstanding, which is classified as long-term debt. As of December 31, 2023, there were no CP Notes outstanding.
Unsecured Committed Term Loan Facility
  On January 30, 2024, APA entered into a syndicated credit agreement under which the lenders committed an aggregate $2.0 billion for senior unsecured delayed-draw term loans to APA (Term Loan Credit Agreement) the proceeds of which could be used to refinance certain indebtedness of Callon only once upon the date of the closings under the Merger Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement. Of such aggregate commitments, $1.5 billion was for term loans that would mature three years after the date of such closings (3-Year Tranche Loans) and $500 million was for term loans that would mature 364 days after the date of such closings (364-Day Tranche Loans). Apache has guaranteed obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement effective until the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures first is less than $1.0 billion.
On April 1, 2024 (the Closing Date), APA closed the transactions under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, electing to borrow an aggregate $1.5 billion in 3-Year Tranche Loans maturing April 1, 2027 and to allow the lender commitments for the 364-Day Tranche Loans to expire. As of December 31, 2024, there were $900 million in 3-Year Tranche Loans remaining outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.
Loan proceeds were used to refinance certain indebtedness of Callon upon the substantially simultaneous closing of APA’s acquisition of Callon pursuant to the Merger Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses. APA may at any time prepay loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. 
Borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement bear interest at one of two rate options selected by APA, being either (i) an alternate base rate (as defined), plus a margin (Term Base Rate Margin) varying from 0.375% to 1.125% for 3-Year Tranche Loans until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and 0.625% to 1.375% for 3-Year Tranche Loans after the second anniversary of the Closing Date, or (ii) an adjusted term SOFR rate (as defined), plus a margin (Term Applicable Margin) varying from 1.375% to 2.125% for 3-Year Tranche Loans until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and 1.625% to 2.375% for 3-Year Tranche Loans after the second anniversary of the Closing Date.
Margins are at varying rates per annum determined by reference to the senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money of APA, or if such indebtedness is not rated and the Apache guaranty is in effect, of Apache (Long-Term Debt Rating). As of December 31, 2024, Apache’s Long-Term Debt Rating applied, and the Term Base Rate Margin was 0.75% for 3-Year Tranche Loans, and the Term Applicable Margin was 1.75% for 3-Year Tranche Loans. 
APA is subject to representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, such as:
•
A financial covenant requires APA to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2024, APA’s debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the Term Loan Credit Agreement was 19 percent.
•
A negative covenant restricts the ability of APA and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on their hydrocarbon-related assets, with customary exceptions and exceptions for liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the U.S. and Canada. Liens on assets also are permitted if debt secured thereby does not exceed 15 percent of APA’s consolidated net tangible assets or approximately $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2024.
49
•
Negative covenants restrict APA’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, a borrower’s disposition of substantially all of its assets, prohibitions on the ability of certain subsidiaries to make payments to borrowers, and guarantees by APA or certain subsidiaries of debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.
•
Lenders may accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending commitments for nonpayment and other breaches; if APA or certain subsidiaries default on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold, or has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold; or APA undergoes a specified change in control. Such acceleration and termination are automatic upon specified insolvency events of APA or certain subsidiaries.
The Term Loan Credit Agreement does not permit lenders to accelerate maturity based on unspecified material adverse changes and does not have prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
The Company was in compliance with the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.
Subsequent Event—Unsecured 2025 Committed Bank Credit Facilities
On January 15, 2025, the Company terminated commitments under the 2022 Agreements and in replacement thereof, entered into two unsecured syndicated credit agreements for general corporate purposes on terms substantially the same as those of the 2022 Agreements:
•
One agreement is denominated in US dollars (the 2025 USD Agreement) and provides for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility for loans and letters of credit, with aggregate commitments of US$2.0 billion (including a letter of credit subfacility of up to US$750 million, of which US$250 million currently is committed). APA may increase commitments up to an aggregate US$2.5 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. This facility matures in January 2030, subject to the Company’s two, one-year extension options.
•
The second agreement is denominated in pounds sterling (the 2025 GBP Agreement) and provides for an unsecured five-year revolving credit facility, with aggregate commitments of £1.5 billion for loans and letters of credit. This facility matures in January 2030, subject to the Company’s two, one-year extension options.
Apache has guaranteed obligations under each of the 2025 USD Agreement and 2025 GBP Agreement (each, a 2025 Agreement) effective until the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures first is less than US$1.0 billion.
Letters of credit are available under each 2025 Agreement for credit support needs of APA and its subsidiaries, including in respect of North Sea decommissioning obligations. As of January 15, 2025, letters of credit aggregating approximately £253 million originally issued under the 2022 GBP Agreement were deemed issued and outstanding under the 2025 GBP Agreement.
All borrowings under the 2025 USD Agreement bear interest at one of two per annum rate options selected by the borrower, being either an alternate base rate (as defined), plus a margin varying from 0.0% to 0.675% (Base Rate Margin), or an adjusted term SOFR rate (as defined), plus a margin varying from 1.00% to 1.675% (Applicable Margin). All borrowings under the 2025 GBP Agreement bear interest with respect to any business day at an adjusted rate per annum determined by reference to the Sterling Overnight Index Average with respect to such business day published by the Bank of England, plus the Applicable Margin.
Each 2025 Agreement also requires the borrower to pay quarterly (i) a facility fee on total commitments at a per annum rate that varies from 0.125% to 0.325% and (ii) a commission on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect.  Customary letter of credit fronting fees and other charges are payable to issuing banks.
Margins and facility fees are at varying rates per annum determined by reference to the senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money of APA, or if such indebtedness is not rated and the Apache guaranty is in effect, of Apache (Long-Term Debt Rating). APA’s Long-Term Debt Rating currently applies, and the Base Rate Margin is 0.30%, the Applicable Margin is 1.30%, and the facility fee is 0.20%.
50
Borrowers under each 2025 Agreement, which include certain subsidiaries of APA, may borrow, prepay, and reborrow loans and obtain letters of credit, and APA may obtain letters of credit for the account of its subsidiaries, in each case subject to representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default, such as:
•
A financial covenant requires APA to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 65% at the end of any fiscal quarter.
•
A negative covenant restricts the ability of APA and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on their hydrocarbon-related assets, with customary exceptions and exceptions for liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the U. S. and Canada. Liens on assets also are permitted if debt secured thereby does not exceed 15% of APA’s consolidated net tangible assets.
•
Negative covenants restrict APA’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, a borrower’s disposition of substantially all of its assets, prohibitions on the ability of certain subsidiaries to make payments to borrowers, and guarantees by APA or certain subsidiaries of debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.
•
Lenders may accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches; if a borrower or certain subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold, or has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold; or APA undergoes a specified change in control. Such acceleration and termination are automatic upon specified insolvency events of a borrower or certain subsidiaries.
The 2025 Agreements do not require collateral, do not have a borrowing base, do not permit lenders to accelerate maturity or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes, and do not have borrowing restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
Subsequent Event—APA Exchange and Tender Offers for Apache Indenture Debt
On January 10, 2025, the Company settled its private exchange and cash tender offers for certain notes and debentures issued by Apache under its indentures. The Company also then settled its private offering of new notes to fund in part its purchase of Apache notes in APA’s cash tender offers.  In settling these offerings pursuant to their respective terms:
•
A
PA issued new notes and debentures under its indentures in aggregate principal amounts of (i) $2.5 billion in exchange for Apache notes and debentures tendered and accepted in APA’s exchange offers, (ii) $203 million in exchange for Apache notes tendered in the cash tender offers in excess of the stated maximum purchase amount or series caps, and (iii) $850 million in the new notes offering, comprised of $350 million aggregate principal amount of APA’s 6.10% Notes due 2035 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of APA’s 6.75% Notes due 2055.
•
In addition to issuing the APA notes in the exchange offers, APA paid a total of $2.5 million in cash as part of the exchange consideration.
•
APA paid a total of $869 million in cash in the tender offers (comprised of tender offer consideration, exchange consideration for tendered notes exchanged, early participation premium, and accrued interest) for the aggregate $1 billion in principal amount of Apache notes tendered and accepted in the cash tender offers.
•
Net proceeds from the sale of the notes in APA’s new notes offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $839 million and used to fund in part APA’s purchase of Apache notes in APA’s cash tender offers.
•
Each series of APA notes and debentures issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers has the same interest rate, maturity date, and interest payment dates and the same optional redemption prices (if any) as the corresponding series of Apache notes and debentures for which they were exchanged.
•
Each series of APA notes and debentures issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers and new notes offering are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache until the first time that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures is less than $1 billion.
•
APA entered into two registration rights agreements, one covering notes and debentures issued in APA’s exchange and tender offers and one covering notes issued in APA’s new notes offering (each a Registration Rights Agreement). 
51
These offerings were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), in reliance upon an exemption therefrom, and the APA notes and debentures issued pursuant to such offers are subject to certain transfer restrictions. Each Registration Rights Agreement requires APA and Apache to use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be filed a registration statement with respect to a registered offer to exchange each series of APA notes issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers or new notes offering, as applicable, for registered notes issued by APA and guaranteed, if applicable, by Apache containing terms substantially identical in all material respects to the applicable series of APA notes issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers or new notes offering (except that the registered notes will not contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions or any increase in annual interest rate) and (ii) cause such registration statement to become effective under the Securities Act.  If, among other events, such exchange offers are not completed on or prior to the 360th day following January 10, 2025, then additional interest will accrue on the principal amount of such registrable securities at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90-day period beginning on the day immediately following such registration default (which rate will be increased by an additional 0.25% per annum for each subsequent 90-day period that such additional interest continues to accrue, provided that the rate at which such additional interest accrues may in no event exceed 1.00% per annum). To the extent Apache’s guarantee of the registrable securities is terminated in accordance with the terms of such guarantee, the registered notes will not be guaranteed by Apache, the exchange offer and registration requirements with respect thereto will be the sole obligation of the Company, and Apache will automatically be released from all obligations under the applicable Registration Rights Agreement.
The following table presents the aggregate principal amounts of notes and debentures outstanding under indentures of APA and Apache on January 10, 2025 upon settlement of the APA’s exchange and tender offers and new notes offering (Apache notes due 2025 were not included in APA’s exchange or tender offers):

The Apache March 2026 notes, the Apache April 2026 notes, the Apache 2037 notes, the Apache 2040 notes, the Apache 2042 notes, the Apache 2047 debentures, and the Apache 2096 debentures were issued under the Senior Indenture, dated as of February 15, 1996, between Apache and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee), as trustee (an Apache Indenture).
(2)
The Apache 2029 notes were issued under the Indenture, dated as of November 23, 1999, between Apache (as successor to Apache Finance Canada Corporation), and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly known as The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as successor to The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee), as trustee (an Apache Indenture).
(3)
The Apache 2043 notes and the Apache 2044 notes were issued under the Senior Indenture, dated as of May 19, 2011, between Apache and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (an Apache Indenture).
(4)
The Apache 2027 notes, the Apache 2028 notes, the Apache 2030 notes, and the Apache 2049 notes were issued under the Indenture, dated as of August 14, 2018, between Apache and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (an Apache Indenture).

(5)
In connection with APA’s exchange and tender offers, Apache solicited the consents of the holders of these Apache notes and debentures to amend the applicable Apache Indenture to remove certain restrictive and reporting covenants. The Apache notes and debentures are senior unsecured obligations of Apache. Apache received consents sufficient to approve the proposed amendments to the Apache Indentures with respect to the Apache March 2026 notes, the Apache 2028 notes, the Apache 2029 notes, the Apache 2030 notes, the Apache 2037 notes, the Apache 2040 notes, the Apache 2042 notes, the Apache 2043 notes, the Apache 2044 notes, the Apache 2047 debentures, the Apache 2049 notes, and the Apache 2096 debentures. As a result, Apache and the respective trustee for the Apache Indentures entered into supplemental indentures on January 10, 2025, implementing the proposed amendments effective as of that date.
(6)
The APA March 2026 notes, the APA April 2026 notes, the APA 2027 notes, the APA 2028 notes, the APA 2029 notes, the APA 2030 notes, the APA 2037 notes, the APA 2040 notes, the APA 2042 notes, the APA 2043 notes, the APA 2044 notes, the APA 2047 debentures, the APA 2049 notes, and the APA 2096 debentures were issued under the Indenture, dated as of June 30, 2021, between the Company, as issuer, and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. These APA notes and debentures were issued in APA’s exchange and tender offers for Apache’s notes and debentures.
(7)
The APA 2035 notes and the APA 2055 notes were issued under the Indenture, dated as of December 11, 2024, between the Company, as issuer, and Regions Bank, as trustee. These APA notes were issued in APA’s new notes offering to fund in part its purchase of Apache notes in APA’s cash tender offers.
Subsequent Event—Open Market Repurchases of Apache Indenture Debt
In the first quarter of 2025 through the date of this filing, Apache purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $55 million for an aggregate purchase price of $50 million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a discount to par of an aggregate $7 million. The Company recognized a $6 million gain on these repurchases. The repurchases were partially financed by APA’s borrowing under the Company’s commercial paper program.
Contractual Obligations
Purchase Obligations  
From time to time, the Company enters into agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, NGL processing agreements, drilling work program commitments and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had contractual obligations totaling $1.1 billion, of which $963 million is related to U.S. firm transportation contracts, $45 million is related to the merged concession agreement with the EGPC, and $110 million is related to other items. Under terms agreed to in the Egypt modernized PSC, the Company committed to spend a minimum of $3.5 billion on exploration, development, and operating activities by March 31, 2026. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has met and fully satisfied the obligation.
Leases  
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various lease agreements for real estate, drilling rigs, vessels, aircrafts, and equipment related to its exploration and development activities, which are typically classified as operating leases under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842 (Leases). As of December 31, 2024, the Company had net undiscounted minimum commitments of $467 million and $37 million for operating and finance leases, respectively. 
Interest Expense
  Future interest payments based on the current maturity dates of the Company’s fixed-rate notes and debentures as of December 31, 2024 are approximately $3.6 billion.

 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. The inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. The Company’s management believes that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $2 million for environmental remediation and approximately $20 million for various contingent legal liabilities. For a detailed discussion of the Company’s environmental and legal contingencies and other commitments, please see 
Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
With respect to oil and gas operations in the Gulf of America, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued a Notice to Lessees (NTL No. 2016-N01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the Gulf of America to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies’ oil and gas leases. While the NTL was paused in mid-2017 and is currently listed on BOEM’s website as “rescinded,” if reinstated, the NTL will likely require that the Company provide additional security to BOEM with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to the Company’s current ownership interests in various Gulf of America leases. Additionally, the Company is not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which the Company has sold Gulf of America assets or with whom the Company has joint ownership. Such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties’ solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.
Potential Decommissioning Obligations on Sold Properties
The Company’s subsidiaries have potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. The Company has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the Gulf of America (GOA) where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and facilities acquired. One or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. If a purchaser of such GOA assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations, APA’s subsidiaries could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations. In such event, such subsidiaries may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.
In 2013, Apache sold its GOA Shelf operations and properties and its GOA operating subsidiary, GOM Shelf LLC (GOM Shelf) to Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood). Fieldwood assumed the obligation to decommission the properties held by GOM Shelf and the properties acquired from Apache and its other subsidiaries (collectively, the Legacy GOA Assets). On February 14, 2018, Fieldwood filed for (and subsequently emerged from) Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On August 3, 2020, Fieldwood filed for (and subsequently emerged from) Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for a second time. Upon emergence from this second bankruptcy, 
the Legacy GOA Assets were separated into a standalone company, which was subsequently merged into GOM Shelf. Under GOM Shelf’s limited liability company agreement, the proceeds of production of the Legacy GOA Assets are to be used to fund the operation of GOM Shelf and the decommissioning of Legacy GOA Assets.

Pursuant to the terms of the original transaction, as amended in the first bankruptcy, 
the securing of the asset retirement obligations for the Legacy GOA Assets as and when Apache is required to perform or pay for any such decommissioning was accomplished through the posting of letters of credit in favor of Apache (Letters of Credit), the provision of two bonds (Bonds) in favor of Apache, and the establishment of a trust account of which Apache was a beneficiary and which was funded by net profits interests (NPIs) depending on future oil prices. In addition, after such sources have been exhausted, Apache agreed upon 
54
resolution of GOM Shelf’s second bankruptcy to provide a standby loan to GOM Shelf of up to $400 million to perform decommissioning, with such standby loan secured by a first and prior lien on the Legacy GOA Assets.
By letter dated April 5, 2022 (replacing two earlier letters) and by subsequent letter dated March 1, 2023, GOM Shelf notified the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) that it was unable to fund the decommissioning obligations that it was obligated to perform on certain of the Legacy GOA Assets. As a result, Apache and other current and former owners in these assets have received orders from BSEE and demands from third parties to decommission certain of the Legacy GOA Assets included in GOM Shelf’s notifications to BSEE. Apache expects to receive similar orders and demands on the other Legacy GOA Assets included in GOM Shelf’s notification letters. Apache has also received orders to decommission other Legacy GOA Assets that were not included in GOM Shelf’s notification letters. Further, Apache anticipates that GOM Shelf may send additional such notices to BSEE in the future and that it may receive additional orders from BSEE requiring it to decommission other Legacy GOA Assets.
On June 21, 2023, two sureties that issued Bonds directly to Apache and two sureties that issued bonds to the issuing bank on the Letters of Credit filed suit against Apache in a case styled 
Zurich American Insurance Company, HCC International Insurance Company PLC, Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company and Everest Reinsurance Company (Insurers) v. Apache Corporation
, Cause No. 2023-38238 in the 281
st
 Judicial District Court, Harris County Texas. The sureties sought to prevent Apache from drawing on the $148 million in Bonds and $350 million in Letters of Credit and further alleged that they are discharged from their reimbursement obligations related to decommissioning costs and are entitled to other relief. On July 20, 2023, the 281
st
 Judicial District Court denied the Insurers’ request for a temporary injunction. On July 26, 2023, Apache removed the suit to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division). Since the time the sureties filed their state court lawsuit, Apache has drawn down the entirety of the $350 million in Letters of Credit. Apache has also sought to draw down on the Bonds; however, the sureties refused to honor such Bond draws. On September 12, 2024, the bankruptcy court issued its opinion (1) finding that sureties’ state court lawsuit against Apache was void; (2) holding that Apache’s claims against the sureties for unpaid amounts may proceed in bankruptcy court; and (3) holding the sureties in civil contempt and awarding attorneys’ fees to Apache as a sanction. The parties settled their dispute in the first quarter of 2025, which resulted in, among other things, mutual releases, the retention by Apache of all amounts drawn on the Letters of Credit, and payment to Apache of $140 million under the Bonds.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded an asset of $178 million representing the remaining amount the Company expects to be reimbursed from security related to these decommissioning costs.
As of December 31, 2024, Apache estimates that its potential liability to fund the remaining decommissioning of Legacy GOA Assets and assets previously sold to other operators ranges from $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion on an undiscounted basis. Management does not believe any specific estimate within this range is a better estimate than any other. Accordingly, the Company recorded contingent liabilities in the amounts of $1.0 billion and $824 million as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the total liability recorded as of December 31, 2024, $929 million is reflected under the caption “Decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of America properties” and $88 million is reflected under “Other current liabilities” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Changes in significant assumptions impacting Apache’s estimated liability, including expected well decommissioning spread rates, derrick barge rates, and planned abandonment logistics, could result in a liability in excess of the amount accrued.
The Company recognized $273 million of “Losses on previously sold Gulf of America properties” during 2024 to reflect the net impact of an increase in estimated decommissioning costs of Legacy GOA Assets which BSSE may order the Company to decommission. The loss includes $67 million related to properties previously sold to third parties other than Fieldwood for which the Company received BSSE orders to decommission during the year, as well as an increase to the estimated net liability the Company expects to incur for decommissioning Legacy GOA Assets. The Company also recognized losses on previously sold Gulf of America properties of $212 million and $157 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively, in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.
55
Insurance Program
The Company maintains insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to its assets, general liabilities, workers’ compensation, employers’ liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. The Company’s insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that it must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance. Additionally, the Company’s insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations. There is no assurance that insurance will adequately protect the Company against liability from all potential consequences and damages. Further, the Company does not have coverage in place for a variety of other risks including Gulf of America named windstorm and business interruption. Service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify the Company for injuries and death of the service provider’s employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider. 
The Company purchases multi-year political risk insurance from The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit Trade (ICIEC, an agency of the Islamic Development Bank) and highly-rated insurers covering a portion of its investments in Egypt for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks. In the aggregate, these insurance policies provide up to $750 million of coverage, subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately $500 million.
Future insurance coverage for the Company’s industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable or unavailable on terms economically acceptable.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company prepares its financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. The Company identifies certain accounting policies involving estimation as critical accounting estimates based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, as well as the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting estimates address accounting matters that are inherently uncertain due to unknown future resolution of such matters. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each critical accounting estimate. The following is a discussion of the Company’s most critical accounting estimates.
Long-Lived Asset Impairments
Long-lived assets used in operations, including proved oil and gas properties and GPT assets, are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. If there is an indication that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recovered, the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is assessed by management using the income approach.
Under the income approach, the fair value of each asset group is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, expected throughput volumes for GPT assets, discount rates, and other variables. Key assumptions used in developing a discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves; estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating and administrative costs. The Company discounts the resulting future cash flows using a discount rate believed to be consistent with those applied by market participants. 
To assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, when available, management uses a market approach to compare the fair value to similar assets. This requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable assets, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums.
56
Although the fair value estimate of each asset group is based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. Negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the asset group, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an additional impairment of long-lived assets in future periods.
The Company has recorded material impairments of certain proved oil and gas properties and gathering, processing, and transmission facilities during 2024. For discussion of these impairments, see “Fair Value Measurements” of 
Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Purchase Price Allocation
Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. The amount of goodwill or bargain purchase gain recognized, if any, is determined based on the consideration transferred compared to the amounts of the identifiable net assets acquired on the acquisition date.
The purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known.
In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company has made various assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved oil and natural gas properties. The fair value of proved oil and natural gas properties as of the acquisition date were estimated using the income approach where fair value was determined based on the expected future cash flows from estimated proved oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves and related discounted future net cash flows as of that date. Significant inputs to the fair value estimate included estimates of future production volumes, future operating and development costs, future commodity prices, and a weighted average cost of capital discount rate.
The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. Historically there has been volatility in oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. Additionally, the actual timing of the production could be different than projected volumes as of the acquisition date.
Reserves Estimates
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.
Despite judgment involved in these engineering estimates, the Company’s reserves are used throughout its financial statements. For example, since the Company uses the units-of-production method to amortize its oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact DD&A expense. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments. Finally, these reserves are the basis for the Company’s supplemental oil and gas disclosures. For more information regarding the Company’s supplemental oil and gas disclosures, refer to 
Note 17—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited)
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous twelve months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.
The Company has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.
57
Offshore Decommissioning Contingency
The Company has potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. For information regarding estimated potential decommissioning obligations on sold properties, please refer to “Potential Decommissioning Obligations on Sold Properties” above and in 
Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company’s estimated contingent obligation is primarily associated with the abandonment, removal and decommissioning of offshore wells and platforms in the Gulf of America. Estimating any future obligation requires significant judgment. The Company utilizes actual abandonment and decommissioning costs incurred as the basis to estimate the expected cash outflows for future obligations. Actual costs incurred often vary based on each structure’s condition, depth-of-water, type, and other similar factors, which are key considerations when estimating the remaining well and platform decommissioning obligation. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, and safety considerations. Changes in significant assumptions or the regulatory framework impacting the Company’s estimated liability could result in a liability in excess of the amount accrued.
Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)
The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. The Company’s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, and safety considerations.
ARO associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. The liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with the Company’s oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.
Income Taxes
The Company’s oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements and tax returns. Management routinely assesses the ability to realize the Company’s deferred tax assets. If management concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).

ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Company’s exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil, gas, and NGL prices, interest rates, or foreign currency and adverse governmental actions. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking information provides indicators of how the Company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures.
Commodity Price Risk
The Company’s revenues, earnings, cash flow, capital investments and, ultimately, future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices the Company receives for its crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs, which have historically been very volatile because of unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction, weather, political climate, and global supply and demand. The Company continually monitors its market risk exposure, as oil and gas supply and demand are impacted by uncertainties in the commodity and financial markets associated with the conflict in Ukraine, the conflict in Israel and Gaza, actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including OPEC+, global inflation, and other current events.
The Company’s average crude oil price realizations decreased 3 percent to $78.08 per barrel in 2024 from $80.72 per barrel in 2023. The Company’s average natural gas price realizations decreased 32 percent to $1.97 per Mcf in 2024 from $2.91 per Mcf in 2023. The Company’s average NGL price realizations increased 8 percent to $23.37 per barrel in 2024 from $21.54 per barrel in 2023. Based on average daily production for 2024, a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized oil price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $89 million, a $0.10 per Mcf change in the weighted average realized natural gas price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $30 million, and a $1.00 per barrel change in the weighted average realized NGL price would have increased or decreased revenues for the year by approximately $27 million.
The Company periodically enters into derivative positions on a portion of its projected crude oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices. Such derivative positions may include the use of futures contracts, swaps, and/or options. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no open commodity derivative positions. Refer to 
Note 4—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report Form 10-K for notional volumes and terms with the Company’s derivative contracts.
Interest Rate Risk
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $4.8 billion, net, in outstanding notes and debentures, all of which was fixed-rate debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.34 percent. Although near-term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of fixed-rate debt, such changes do not expose the Company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss associated with that debt. 
The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk related to its interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances and amounts outstanding under its term loan facility, commercial paper program, and syndicated credit facilities. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $625 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately 98 percent of which was invested in money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. As of December 31, 2024, there were $1.2 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Company’s term loan facility, commercial paper program, and syndicated revolving credit facilities. Changes in the interest rate applicable to short-term investments, term loan facility, commercial paper program, and credit facility borrowings are expected to have an immaterial impact on earnings and cash flows but could impact interest costs associated with future debt issuances or any future borrowings.
59
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
The Company’s cash activities relating to certain international operations is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies. The Company’s North Sea production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, while the majority of costs incurred are paid in British pounds. The Company’s Egypt production is sold under U.S. dollar contracts, and the majority of costs incurred are denominated in U.S. dollars. Transactions denominated in British pounds are converted to U.S. dollar equivalents based on the average exchange rates during the period. The Company monitors foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is conducting business and may, from time to time, implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Foreign currency gains and losses also arise when monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month. Foreign currency gains and losses are included as either a component of “Other, net” under “Revenues and Other” or, as is the case when the Company re-measures its foreign tax liabilities, as a component of the Company’s provision for income tax expense on the statement of consolidated operations. Foreign currency net gain or loss of $5 million would result from a 10 percent weakening or strengthening, respectively, in the British pound as of December 31, 2024.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written code of business conduct adopted by our Company’s board of directors, applicable to all Company directors and all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).
 Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
The Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of the Company’s board of directors. Ernst & Young LLP have audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of APA Corporation and subsidiaries and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors follow this report on pages F-2 and F-3.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of APA Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited APA Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, APA Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of consolidated operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity and noncontrolling interest for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of APA Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of APA Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of consolidated operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity and noncontrolling interest for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of property and equipment
Description of
the Matter
At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of the Company’s property and equipment was $12,646 million, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense was $2,266 million for the year then ended. As described in Note 1, the Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. DD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method based on proved oil and gas reserves, as estimated by the Company’s internal reservoir engineers.
F-3
Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Judgment is required by the Company’s internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves. Estimating proved oil and gas reserves requires the selection of inputs, including historical production, oil and gas price assumptions, and operating costs, among others. Because of the complexity involved in estimating oil and gas reserves, management engaged independent petroleum engineers to audit the proved oil and gas reserve estimates prepared by the Company’s internal reservoir engineers for select properties as of December 31, 2024.   
Auditing the Company’s DD&A calculations is complex because of the use of the work of the internal reservoir engineers and the independent petroleum engineers. 
How We
Addressed the
Matter in Our
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over its process to calculate DD&A, including management’s controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data utilized by the engineers for use in estimating oil and gas reserves.
Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company’s internal reservoir engineers responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates and the independent petroleum engineers used to audit the proved oil and gas reserve estimates. Additionally, we evaluated the methods and assumptions used by the engineers in estimating proved oil and gas reserves and tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used by the engineers related to historical production volumes. We also tested that the DD&A expense calculations are based on the appropriate proved oil and gas reserve balances from the Company’s reserve report.
Accounting for asset retirement obligation for the North Sea segment
Description of
the Matter
At December 31, 2024, the asset retirement obligation (ARO) balance totaled $2,694 million. As further described in Note 8, the Company’s ARO reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with the Company’s oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The estimation of the ARO related to the North Sea segment requires significant judgment given the magnitude of the expected retirement costs.
Auditing the Company’s ARO for the North Sea segment is complex and highly judgmental because of the significant estimation required by management in determining the obligation. In particular, the estimate was sensitive to retirement cost estimates, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions.
How We
Addressed the
Matter in Our
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over its ARO estimation process, including management’s review of the significant assumptions that have a material effect on the determination of the obligation.
To test the ARO for the North Sea segment, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the significant assumptions and inputs used in the valuation, such as retirement cost estimates. For example, we evaluated retirement cost estimates by comparing the Company’s estimates to underlying third party evidence or market information. We also involved our internal specialists in testing the underlying retirement cost estimates.
Accounting for decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of America properties
Description of
the Matter
At December 31, 2024, the decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of America properties (decommissioning contingency) balance totaled $1 billion. As further described in Note 11, the Company’s decommissioning contingency reflects the estimated undiscounted potential liability to fund decommissioning of the sold Gulf of America properties. The estimation of the decommissioning contingency requires significant judgment given the magnitude and higher estimation uncertainty of the expected retirement costs.
F-4
Auditing the Company’s decommissioning contingency is complex and highly judgmental because of the significant estimation required by management in determining the decommissioning contingency. In particular, the estimate was sensitive to retirement cost estimates, which are subjective assumptions affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions.
How We
Addressed the
Matter in Our
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over its decommissioning contingency estimation process, including management’s review of the significant assumptions that have a material effect on the determination of the contingency.
To test the decommissioning contingency, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the significant assumptions and inputs used developing the retirement cost estimates. For example, we evaluated retirement cost estimates by comparing the Company’s estimates to market information. We also involved our internal specialists in testing the underlying retirement cost estimates.
Evaluation of the fair value measurement of proved oil and gas properties acquired in the Callon Petroleum business combination
Description of
the Matter
During 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Callon Petroleum Company resulting in the recognition of the fair value of property and equipment of $4,502 million. As described in Note 2, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.
The Company applied a discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of the proved oil and gas properties acquired. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices, future production volumes, and discount rate using a market-based weighted average cost of capital. Judgment is required by the Company’s internal reservoir engineers in estimating future production quantities.
Auditing the Company’s fair value measurement of the proved oil and gas properties acquired is complex because of the use of the work of the Company’s internal reservoir engineers in estimating future production and the evaluation of management’s determination of the inputs described above. In evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor judgement and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.
How We
Addressed the
Matter in Our
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls to estimate the fair value of the acquired proved oil and gas properties, including management’s review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations.
To test the fair value of the acquired proved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company’s internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the future production volumes. In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the fair value calculation. We also involved our valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the fair value estimate.

APA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Nature of Operations
APA Corporation (APA or the Company) is an independent energy company that owns consolidated subsidiaries that explore for, develop, and produce crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. The Company’s business has oil and gas operations in 
three
 geographic areas: the United States (U.S.), Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). APA also has active development, exploration, and appraisal operations ongoing in Suriname, as well as exploration interests in Uruguay, Alaska, and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. Prior to the BCP Business Combination defined below, the Company’s midstream business was operated by Altus Midstream Company (ALTM) through its subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus).

1.   
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting policies used by APA and its subsidiaries reflect industry practices and conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The Company’s financial statements for prior periods may include reclassifications that were made to conform to the current-year presentation. Significant accounting policies are discussed below.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of APA and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.
The Company’s undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and production ventures and partnerships are proportionately consolidated. The Company consolidates all other investments in which, either through direct or indirect ownership, it has more than a 50 percent voting interest or controls the financial and operating decisions. 
Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) owns a one-third minority participation in the Company’s consolidated Egypt oil and gas business as a noncontrolling interest, which is reflected as a separate noncontrolling interest component of equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company has determined that a limited partnership and APA subsidiary, which has control over APA’s Egyptian operations, qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under GAAP. Apache consolidates the activities of APA’s Egyptian operations because it has concluded that a wholly owned subsidiary has a controlling financial interest in APA’s Egyptian operations and was determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
On February 22, 2022, ALTM closed a transaction to combine with privately owned BCP Raptor Holdco LP (BCP and, together with BCP Raptor Holdco GP, LLC, the Contributed Entities) in an all-stock transaction, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement entered into by and among ALTM, Altus Midstream LP, New BCP Raptor Holdco, LLC (the Contributor), and BCP (the BCP Contribution Agreement). Pursuant to the BCP Contribution Agreement, the Contributor contributed all of the equity interests of the Contributed Entities (the Contributed Interests) to Altus Midstream LP, with each Contributed Entity becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Altus Midstream LP (the BCP Business Combination). Upon closing the transaction, the combined entity was renamed Kinetik Holdings Inc. (Kinetik), and the Company determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of Kinetik. The Company further determined that Kinetik no longer qualified as a VIE under GAAP.

As a result, the Company deconsolidated ALTM on February 22, 2022. Refer to 
Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures
 for further detail.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a designated director on the Kinetik board of directors. The Company’s designated director resigned from the Kinetik board of directors on April 3, 2024. As a result, the Company is considered to have had significant influence over Kinetik during the periods presented prior to the designated director’s resignation from the Kinetik board of directors.
Investments in which the Company has significant influence, but not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded separately as “Equity method interests” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company elected the fair value option to account for its equity method interest in Kinetik.

Use of Estimates
Preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the Company’s financial statements, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. 
Significant estimates with regard to these financial statements include the estimates of fair value for long-lived assets (refer to “Fair Value Measurements” and “Property and Equipment” sections in this Note 1 below), the fair value determination of acquired assets and liabilities (refer to 
Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures
), the fair value of equity method interests (refer to “Equity Method Interests” within this Note 1 below and 
Note 6—Equity Method Interests
), the assessment of asset retirement obligations (refer to 
Note 8—Asset Retirement Obligation
), the estimate of income taxes (refer to 
Note 10—Income Taxes
), the estimation of the contingent liability representing Apache’s potential decommissioning obligations on sold properties in the Gulf of America (refer to 
Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies
), and the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves and related present value estimates of future net cash flows therefrom (refer to 
Note 17—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited)
).
Fair Value Measurements
Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10-35, “Fair Value Measurement” (ASC 820), provides a hierarchy that prioritizes and defines the types of inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs, which consist of unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices for similar instruments. Level 3 valuations are derived from inputs that are significant and unobservable; hence, these valuations have the lowest priority.
The valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value include a market approach, an income approach, and a cost approach. A market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. An income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations, including present value techniques, option-pricing models, and the excess earnings method. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).
Refer to 
Note 4—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
, 
Note 9—Debt and Financing Costs
, and 
Note 12—Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans
 for further detail regarding the Company’s fair value measurements recorded on a recurring basis.
The Company also uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis when certain qualitative assessments of its assets indicate a potential impairment or when allocating the purchase price for acquired assets and liabilities in a business combination.
During 2024, the Company continued its economic assessment of its North Sea assets in light of several new regulatory guidelines and obligations surrounding significant tax levies and modernization of aging infrastructure. The Company determined the expected returns do not economically support making investments required under the combined impact of the regulations, and it will cease production at its facilities in the North Sea prior to 2030. As a result, in the third quarter of 2024 the Company performed a fair value assessment of the present value of its oil and gas assets in the North Sea. Accordingly, the Company recognized impairments of $
796
 million on certain proved properties in the North Sea, which were written down to their estimated fair values as of September 30, 2024. This impairment is discussed in further detail below in “Property and Equipment — Oil and Gas Property.”
On April 1, 2024, APA completed its acquisition of Callon Petroleum Company (Callon) in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $
4.5
 billion, inclusive of Callon’s debt (the Callon acquisition). The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date, using various Level 3 fair value measurements. Material assets and liabilities acquired are discussed further below:

APA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
•
The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved oil and natural gas properties. The fair value of proved oil and natural gas properties as of the acquisition date were estimated using the income approach, where fair value was determined based on the expected future cash flows from estimated proved oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves and related discounted future net cash flows as of that date. Significant inputs to the fair value estimate included estimates of future production volumes, future operating and development costs, future commodity prices, and a weighted-average cost of capital discount rate.
•
The fair value of unproved properties was estimated mainly using the market approach, based on acreage costs in areas where Callon acreage was acquired.
•
The fair value of most other current assets and current liabilities were determined to be equivalent to the carrying value due to their short-term nature.
•
The fair value of debt was based on the estimated cost to retire Callon’s debt instruments.
•
Estimated deferred taxes were based on available information concerning the fair values assigned to acquired assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and tax-related carryforwards at the acquisition date.

Additionally, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain non-core U.S. oil and gas producing properties in the Permian Basin. As a result of this agreement, a separate impairment analysis was performed for each of the assets within the disposal group. The analyses were based on the agreed-upon proceeds less costs to sell for the transaction, a Level 1 fair value measurement. The historical carrying value of the net assets to be divested exceeded the fair value implied by the expected net proceeds, resulting in an impairment totaling $
315
 million on the Company’s proved properties in the U.S. Refer to 
Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures
 for more detail.
For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $
11
 million and 
no
 asset impairments, respectively, in connection with fair value assessments.
Revenue Recognition
The Company’s oil and gas segments primarily generate revenue from contracts with customers from the sale of its crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production volumes. In addition to APA-related production volumes, the Company also sells commodity volumes purchased from third parties to provide flexibility to fulfill sales obligations and commitments. Under these commodity sales contracts, the physical delivery of each unit of quantity represents a single, distinct performance obligation on behalf of the Company. Contract prices are determined based on market-indexed prices, adjusted for quality, transportation, and other market-reflective differentials. Revenue is measured by allocating an entirely variable market price to each performance obligation and recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. The Company considers a variety of facts and circumstances in assessing the point of control transfer, including but not limited to: whether the purchaser can direct the use of the hydrocarbons, the transfer of significant risks and rewards, and the Company’s right to payment. Control typically transfers to customers upon the physical delivery at specified locations within each contract and the transfer of title. 
APA’s Egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production-sharing contracts (PSCs). Under the terms of the Company’s PSCs, the Company is the contractor partner (Contractor) with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and bears the risk and cost of exploration, development, and production activities. In return, if exploration is successful, the Contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery. Additionally, the Contractor’s income taxes, which remain the liability of the Contractor under domestic law, are paid by EGPC on behalf of the Contractor out of EGPC’s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of the Contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves. Because Contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount, the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices. In addition, because the Contractor income taxes are paid by EGPC, the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on the Company’s Egypt operations despite impacting the Company’s production and reserves.

Note 16—Business Segment Information
 for a disaggregation of revenue by product and reporting segment.

Payment Terms and Contract Balances
Receivables from contracts with customers, including receivables for purchased oil and gas sales and net of allowance for credit losses, were $
1.7
 billion and $
1.5
 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Payments under all contracts with customers are typically due and received within a short-term period of one year or less, after physical delivery of the product or service has been rendered. In the past year, the Company’s receivable balance from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) has gradually increased as payments for the Company’s Egyptian oil and gas sales have been delayed for periods longer than historically experienced. The Company is actively engaged in discussions with the Government of Egypt to resolve the delay in EGPC payments. The Company has received payments throughout 2024, and management believes that the Company will be able to collect the total balance of its receivables from this customer.
In accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” variable market prices for each short-term commodity sale are allocated entirely to each performance obligation as the terms of payment relate specifically to the Company’s efforts to satisfy its obligations. As such, the Company has elected the practical expedients available under the standard to not disclose the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, performance obligations as of the end of the reporting period.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
625
 million and $
87
 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. The Company had 
no
 restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses
Accounts receivable are stated at amortized cost net of an allowance for credit losses. The Company routinely assesses the collectability of its financial assets measured at amortized cost. The Company monitors the credit quality of its counterparties through review of collections, credit ratings, and other analyses. The Company develops its estimated allowance for expected credit losses primarily using an aging method and analyses of historical loss rates as well as consideration of current and future conditions that could impact its counterparties’ credit quality and liquidity.

Inventories
Inventories consist principally of tubular goods and equipment and are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value. Oil produced but not sold, primarily in the North Sea, is also recorded to inventory and is stated at the lower of the cost to produce or net realizable value.
During 2024, the Company recorded $
18
 million of inventory impairments, including $
13
 million in the North Sea and $
5
 million in the U.S.
The Company also recorded other impairments during 2023 of approximately $
50
 million in connection with valuations of drilling and operations equipment inventory upon the Company’s decision to suspend drilling operations in the North Sea.
Property and Equipment
The carrying value of the Company’s property and equipment represents the cost incurred to acquire the property and equipment, including capitalized interest, net of any impairments. For business combinations and acquisitions, property and equipment cost is based on the fair values at the acquisition date.
F-14
APA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
Oil and Gas Property
The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas property. Under this method of accounting, exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, delay rentals, and exploration overhead, are expensed as incurred. All costs related to production, general corporate overhead, and similar activities are expensed as incurred. If an exploratory well provides evidence to justify potential development of reserves, drilling costs associated with the well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. This determination may take longer than one year in certain areas depending on, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan, and government sanctioning of development activities in certain international locations. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory well costs in light of ongoing exploration activities; in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed.
Acquisition costs of unproved properties are assessed for impairment at least annually and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment based on the Company’s current exploration plans. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis over the average lease term at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged to exploration expense, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration costs in the statement of consolidated operations.
The following table represents non-cash impairment charges of the carrying value of the Company’s proved and unproved properties:

Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized. Depreciation of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production (UOP) method. The UOP calculation multiplies the percentage of estimated proved reserves produced each quarter by the carrying value of associated proved oil and gas properties. The reserve base used to calculate depreciation for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. The reserve base used to calculate the depreciation for capitalized well costs is the sum of proved developed reserves only. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are included in the depreciable cost.
Oil and gas properties are grouped for depreciation in accordance with ASC 932, “Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas.” The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.
F-15
APA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
When circumstances indicate that the carrying value of proved oil and gas properties may not be recoverable, the Company compares unamortized capitalized costs to the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows for the associated assets grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows of other assets. If the expected undiscounted pre-tax future cash flows, based on the Company’s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Fair value is generally estimated using the income approach described in ASC 820. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments, a Level 3 fair value measurement.
The change in cessation-of-production dates in the North Sea discussed above in “Fair Value Measurements” significantly altered the Company’s remaining oil and gas reserves in the North Sea and triggered an impairment assessment of the Company’s proved oil and gas properties at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Future production volumes and estimated future commodity prices are the largest drivers in variability of future cash flows. Expected cash flows were estimated based on management’s views of forward pricing as of the balance sheet dates. A discount rate based on a market-based weighted-average cost of capital estimate was applied to the undiscounted cash flow estimate to value the Company’s North Sea assets. In connection with this assessment, the Company recorded impairments totaling $
796
 million on certain of the Company’s North Sea proved properties to an aggregate fair value of $
263
 million.
Additionally, in the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain non-core U.S. oil and gas producing properties in the Permian Basin. As a result of this agreement, a separate impairment analysis was performed for each of the assets within the disposal group. The analyses were based on the agreed-upon proceeds less costs to sell for the transaction, a Level 1 fair value measurement. The historical carrying value of the net assets to be divested exceeded the fair value implied by the expected net proceeds, resulting in an impairment totaling $
315
 million on the Company’s proved properties in the U.S. Refer to 
Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures
 for more detail.
For the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded 
no
 impairments of proved properties.
Gains and losses on divestitures of the Company’s oil and gas properties are recognized in the statement of consolidated operations upon closing of the transaction.
 Refer to 
Note 2—Acquisitions and Divestitures
 for more detail.
Gathering, Processing, and Transmission (GPT) Facilities
GPT facilities totaled $
433
 million and $
448
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with accumulated depreciation for these assets totaling $
364
 million and $
373
 million for the respective periods. GPT facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimation of useful life takes into consideration anticipated production lives from the fields serviced by the GPT assets, whether APA-operated or third party-operated, as well as potential development plans by the Company for undeveloped acreage within, or close to, those fields.
The Company assesses the carrying amount of its GPT facilities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of these facilities is more than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over its fair value. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023,  and 2022, the Company recorded 
no
 impairments of GPT facilities.
Other Property and Equipment
Other property and equipment includes computer software and equipment, buildings, vehicles, furniture and fixtures, land, and other equipment. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 
3
 to 
20
 years.
 Other property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation totaled $
183
 million and $
217
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Asset Retirement Costs and Obligations
The initial estimated asset retirement obligation related to property and equipment and subsequent revisions are recorded as a liability at fair value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. Revisions in estimated liabilities can result from changes in estimated inflation rates, changes in service and equipment costs and changes in the estimated timing of an asset’s retirement. Asset retirement costs are depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment. Accretion expense on the liability is recognized over the estimated productive life of the related assets.

Capitalized

Interest
For significant projects, interest is capitalized as part of the historical cost of developing and constructing assets. Significant oil and gas investments in unproved properties actively being explored, significant exploration and development projects that have not commenced production, significant midstream development activities that are in progress, and investments in equity method affiliates that are undergoing the construction of assets that have not commenced principal operations qualify for interest capitalization. Interest is capitalized until the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest is determined by multiplying the Company’s weighted-average borrowing cost on debt by the average amount of qualifying costs incurred. Once an asset subject to interest capitalization is completed and placed in service, the associated capitalized interest is expensed through depreciation.

Equity Method Interests
The Company follows the equity method of accounting when it does not exercise control over its equity interests, but can exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the entity. Under this method, the equity interests are carried originally at acquisition cost, increased by the Company’s proportionate share of the equity interest’s net income and contributions made by the Company, and decreased by the Company’s proportionate share of the equity interest’s net losses and distributions received by the Company. Refer to 
Note 6—Equity Method Interests
 for further details of the Company’s equity method interests.
Equity method interests are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred, if the loss is deemed to be other than temporary. When the loss is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in income.
Commitments and Contingencies
Accruals for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, environmental, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted as additional information becomes available or circumstances change.
 For more information regarding loss contingencies, refer to 
Note 11—Commitments and Contingencies
.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company periodically enters into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price, interest rate, and/or foreign exchange risk. These derivative contracts, which are generally placed with major financial institutions, may take the form of forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, or options.
All derivative instruments, other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, are recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to any of its derivative instruments. As a result, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments are reported in current-period income as “Derivative instrument gains (losses), net” under “Revenues and Other” in the statement of consolidated operations.
 Refer to 
Note 4—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
 for further information. 
Income Taxes
The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements and tax returns. The Company routinely assesses the ability to realize its deferred tax assets. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices) and changing tax laws.
 Refer to 
Note 10—Income Taxes
 for further information.
Earnings Per Share
The Company’s basic earnings per share (EPS) amounts have been computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects potential dilution, using the treasury stock method, which assumes that options were exercised and restricted stock was fully vested.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company grants various types of stock-based awards including stock options, restricted stock, cash-settled restricted stock units, and performance-based awards. Stock compensation equity awards granted are valued on the date of grant and are expensed over the required vesting service period. Cash-settled awards are recorded as a liability based on the Company’s stock price and remeasured at the end of each reporting period over the vesting terms. The Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate expected forfeitures.

This update is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2025 and is applied on a prospective basis. The Company does not believe this will have a material impact on its financial statements.
In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40),” which expands disclosures around a public entity’s costs and expenses of specific items (i.e. employee compensation, DD&A), requires the inclusion of amounts that are required to be disclosed under GAAP in the same disclosure as other disaggregation requirements, requires qualitative descriptions of amounts remaining in expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively, and requires disclosure of total selling expenses, and in annual periods, the definition of selling expenses. The amendment does not change or remove existing disclosure requirements. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted, and the amendment can be adopted prospectively or retrospectively to any or all periods presented in the financial statements.

2024 Activity
Callon Petroleum Company Acquisition
On April 1, 2024, APA completed its acquisition of Callon in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $
4.5
 billion, inclusive of Callon’s debt. The transaction was approved by APA and Callon shareholders at special meetings held on March 27, 2024. The acquired assets include approximately 
120,000
 net acres in the Delaware Basin and 
25,000
 net acres in the Midland Basin.
Subject to the terms of the merger agreement (Merger Agreement), each share of Callon common stock was converted into the right to receive 
1.0425
 shares of APA common stock, with cash in lieu of fractional shares. As a result, APA issued approximately 
70
 million shares of APA common stock in connection with the transaction based on the value of APA common stock on the day of closing, and following the acquisition, Callon common stock is no longer listed for trading on the NYSE. In addition to the equity consideration provided, APA transferred approximately $
24
 million in other consideration upon close of the transaction.
Upon completing the acquisition, APA repaid all of Callon’s debt, refinancing a portion by borrowing $

Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year since completion of drilling were $
130
 million at December 31, 2024, with $
115
 million related to Suriname exploration and appraisal. Ongoing analysis of well results and appraisal activity is continuing. The remaining projects pertain to onshore drilling activity in Egypt for which continued testing and evaluation is being performed. 
Dry hole expenses from suspended exploratory well costs previously capitalized for greater than one year at December 31, 2023 totaled $
52
 million. These expenses pertained to projects in Suriname and Egypt.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Objectives and Strategies
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on the majority of its worldwide production, as well as fluctuations in exchange rates in connection with transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Company manages the variability in its cash flows by occasionally entering into derivative transactions on a portion of its crude oil and natural gas production and foreign currency transactions. The Company utilizes various types of derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, futures contracts, swaps, and options, to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity prices. The Company elected not to designate any of its derivative contracts as cash flow hedges.
Embedded Derivatives
As a result of the Callon acquisition, the Company assumed an earn-out obligation from Callon, where the Company could be required to pay up to $
25
 million in the aggregate if the average daily settlement price of WTI crude oil exceeds $
60.00
 per barrel for the 2025 calendar year. The Company determined that the earn-out obligation is not clearly and closely related to the underlying agreements and therefore bifurcated this embedded feature and recorded the derivative at fair value. The Company uses a market approach to estimate the fair values of these derivatives on a recurring basis, utilizing an option pricing model method provided by a reputable third party. The valuation includes significant inputs such as forward oil price curves, time to expiration, and implied volatility. As these inputs are substantially observable for the full term of the contingent consideration arrangements, the inputs are considered a Level 2 fair value measurement.
Derivative Activity Recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet
All derivative instruments are reflected as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. These fair values are recorded by netting asset and liability positions where counterparty master netting arrangements contain provisions for net settlement. 
The carrying value of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities and their locations on the consolidated balance sheet are as follows:

EQUITY METHOD INTERESTS
As of December 31, 2023, the Company held

 million Kinetik Shares, which were recorded at fair value of $
437
 million and reflected separately as “Equity method interests” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company elected the fair value option for measuring its equity method interest in Kinetik. The fair value of the Company’s interest in Kinetik was determined using observable share prices on a major exchange, a Level 1 fair value measurement. On March 18, 2024, the Company sold its remaining Kinetik Shares for cash proceeds of $
428
 million.
Prior to the Company’s sale of its remaining Kinetik Shares and the resignation of the Company’s designated director from the Kinetik board of directors, the Company recorded changes in the fair value of its equity method interest in Kinetik totaling a loss of $
9
 million during 2024, and gains of $

The ARO liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with the Company’s oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The Company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. The Company estimates the ultimate productive life of the properties, a risk-adjusted discount rate, and an inflation factor in order to determine the current present value of this obligation. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property or other long-lived asset balance.
During 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $
15
 million and $
14
 million, respectively, in abandonment liabilities resulting from the Company’s exploration and development capital program. Liabilities settled primarily relate to individual properties, platforms, and facilities plugged and abandoned during the period. During 2024, net abandonment costs were revised upward by approximately $
299
 million, primarily reflecting changes in estimates of timing and activity costs in the U.S. and North Sea, in addition to foreign currency exchange rates on service costs. During 2023, net abandonment costs were revised upward by approximately $
356
 million to reflect changes in estimates of timing, activity costs, and foreign currency exchange rates on service costs in the North Sea

DEBT AND FINANCING COSTS
Overview
The debt of APA and Apache is senior unsecured debt and has equal priority with respect to the payment of both principal and interest. As of December 31, 2024, (i) all indentures of Apache for the notes and debentures described below placed certain restrictions on Apache, including limits on Apache’s ability to incur debt secured by certain liens, and (ii) certain of those indentures also restricted Apache’s ability to enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and gave holders the option to require Apache to repurchase outstanding notes and debentures upon certain changes in control. Each indenture of APA and Apache restricts it from issuing or guaranteeing certain secured indebtedness. None of the indentures contain prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
During 2023, Apache purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $
74
 million for an aggregate purchase price of $
65
 million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a discount to par of an aggregate $
10
 million. The Company recognized a $
9
 million gain on these repurchases. The repurchases were partially financed by Apache’s borrowing under the Company’s US dollar-denominated revolving credit facility.
During 2022, Apache purchased in the open market and canceled senior notes issued under its indentures in an aggregate principal amount of $
15
 million for an aggregate purchase price of $
16
 million in cash, including accrued interest and broker fees, reflecting a premium to par of an aggregate $
1
 million. The Company recognized a $
1
 million loss on these repurchases. The repurchases were partially financed by borrowing under Apache’s former revolving credit facility.
During 2022, Apache closed cash tender offers for certain outstanding notes issued under its indentures, accepting for purchase $
1.1
 billion aggregate principal amount of notes. Apache paid holders an aggregate $
1.2
 billion in cash, reflecting principal, premium to par, and accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recognized a $
66
 million loss on extinguishment of debt, including $
11
 million of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs in connection with the note purchases. The repurchases were partially financed by borrowing under Apache’s former revolving credit facility.
The Company records gains and losses on extinguishment of debt in “Financing costs, net” in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.

1.8
 billion (including a letter of credit subfacility of up to US$
750
 million, of which US$
150
 million was committed).
•
The second agreement was denominated in pounds sterling (the 2022 GBP Agreement) and provided for an unsecured 
five-year
 revolving credit facility, with aggregate commitments of £
1.5
 billion for loans and letters of credit. 
As of December 31, 2024, there were $
10
 million of borrowings under the 2022 USD Agreement and an aggregate £
303
 million in letters of credit outstanding under the GBP Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 letters of credit outstanding under the USD Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, there were $
372
 million of borrowings under the 2022 USD Agreement, and an aggregate £
348
 million in letters of credit outstanding under the GBP Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, there were 
no
 letters of credit outstanding under the 2022 USD Agreement.
The Company was in compliance with the terms of the 2022 Agreements as of December 31, 2024. 
Uncommitted Lines of Credit
Each of the Company and Apache from time to time has and uses uncommitted credit and letter of credit facilities for working capital and credit support purposes. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 outstanding borrowings under these facilities. As of December 31, 2024, there were £
640
 million and $
11
 million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities. As of December 31, 2023, there were £
416
 million and $
2
 million in letters of credit outstanding under these facilities.
Commercial Paper Program

In December 2023, the Company established a commercial paper program under which it from time to time may issue in private placements exempt from registration under the Securities Act short-term unsecured promissory notes (the CP Notes) up to a maximum aggregate face amount of $
1.8
 billion outstanding at any time. The maturities of CP Notes may vary but may not exceed 
397
 days from the date of issuance. Outstanding CP Notes are supported by available borrowing capacity under the Company’s committed revolving credit facilities for general corporate purposes, which as of December 31, 2024, included the $
1.8
 billion 2022 USD Agreement.
Payment of the CP Notes has been unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Apache, such guarantee effective until the first time that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures is less than US$
1.0
 billion.
The CP Notes are sold under customary market terms in the U.S. commercial paper market at a discount from par or at par and bear interest at rates determined at the time of issuance.

 million in aggregate face amount of CP Notes outstanding, which is classified as long-term debt. As of December 31, 2023, there were 
no
 CP Notes outstanding.
Unsecured Committed Term Loan Facility
On January 30, 2024, APA entered into a syndicated credit agreement under which the lenders committed an aggregate $
2.0
 billion for senior unsecured delayed-draw term loans to APA (Term Loan Credit Agreement), the proceeds of which could be used to refinance certain indebtedness of Callon only once upon the date of the closings under the Merger Agreement and Term Loan Credit Agreement. Of such aggregate commitments, $
1.5
 billion was for term loans that would mature 
three years
 after the date of such closings (
3
-Year Tranche Loans) and $
500
 million was for term loans that would mature 
364
 days after the date of such closings (
364
-Day Tranche Loans). Apache has guaranteed obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement effective until the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures first is less than $
1.0
 billion.
On April 1, 2024 (the Closing Date), APA closed the transactions under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, electing to borrow an aggregate $
1.5
 billion in 
3
-Year Tranche Loans maturing April 1, 2027 and to allow the lender commitments for the 
364
-Day Tranche Loans to expire. As of December 31, 2024, $
900
 million in 
3
-Year Tranche Loans remained outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.
Loan proceeds were used to refinance certain indebtedness of Callon upon the substantially simultaneous closing of APA’s acquisition of Callon pursuant to the Merger Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses. APA may at any time prepay loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. 
Borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement bear interest at one of two rate options selected by APA, being either (i) an alternate base rate (as defined), plus a margin (Term Base Rate Margin) varying from 
0.375
% to 
1.125
% for 
3
-Year Tranche Loans until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and 
0.625
% to 
1.375
% for 
3
-Year Tranche Loans after the second anniversary of the Closing Date, or (ii) an adjusted term SOFR rate (as defined), plus a margin (Term Applicable Margin) varying from 
1.375
% to 
2.125
% for 
3
-Year Tranche Loans until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and 
1.625
% to 
2.375
% for 
3
-Year Tranche Loans after the second anniversary of the Closing Date.
Margins are at varying rates per annum determined by reference to the senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money of APA, or if such indebtedness is not rated and the Apache guaranty is in effect, of Apache (Long-Term Debt Rating). As of December 31, 2024, Apache’s Long-Term Debt Rating applied, and the Term Base Rate Margin was 
0.75
% for 
3
-Year Tranche Loans, and the Term Applicable Margin was 
1.75
% for 
3
-Year Tranche Loans. 
APA is subject to representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, such as:
•
A financial covenant requires APA to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 
60
 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. At December 31, 2024, APA’s debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the Term Loan Credit Agreement was 
19
 percent.
•
A negative covenant restricts the ability of APA and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on their hydrocarbon-related assets, with customary exceptions and exceptions for liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the U.S. and Canada. Liens on assets also are permitted if debt secured thereby does not exceed 
15
 percent of APA’s consolidated net tangible assets or approximately $
2.5
 billion as of December 31, 2024.
•
Negative covenants restrict APA’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, a borrower’s disposition of substantially all of its assets, prohibitions on the ability of certain subsidiaries to make payments to borrowers, and guarantees by APA or certain subsidiaries of debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.
•
Lenders may accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending commitments for nonpayment and other breaches; if APA or certain subsidiaries default on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold, or has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold; or APA undergoes a specified change in control. Such acceleration and termination are automatic upon specified insolvency events of APA or certain subsidiaries.
F-28
APA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
The Term Loan Credit Agreement does not permit lenders to accelerate maturity based on unspecified material adverse changes and does not have prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
The Company was in compliance with the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.
Subsequent Event—Unsecured 2025 Committed Bank Credit Facilities
On January 15, 2025, the Company terminated commitments under the 2022 Agreements and in replacement thereof, entered into 
two
 unsecured syndicated credit agreements for general corporate purposes on terms substantially the same as those of the 2022 Agreements:
•
One
 agreement is denominated in US dollars (the 2025 USD Agreement) and provides for an unsecured 
five-year
 revolving credit facility for loans and letters of credit, with aggregate commitments of US$
2.0
 billion (including a letter of credit subfacility of up to US$
750
 million, of which US$
250
 million currently is committed). APA may increase commitments up to an aggregate US$
2.5
 billion by adding new lenders or obtaining the consent of any increasing existing lenders. This facility matures in January 2030, subject to the Company’s 
two
, 
one-year
 extension options.
•
The second agreement is denominated in pounds sterling (the 2025 GBP Agreement) and provides for an unsecured 
five-year
 revolving credit facility, with aggregate commitments of £
1.5
 billion for loans and letters of credit. This facility matures in January 2030, subject to the Company’s 
two
, 
one-year
 extension options.
Apache has guaranteed obligations under each of the 2025 USD Agreement and 2025 GBP Agreement (each, a 2025 Agreement) effective until the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures first is less than US$
1.0
 billion.
Letters of credit are available under each 2025 Agreement for credit support needs of APA and its subsidiaries, including in respect of North Sea decommissioning obligations. As of January 15, 2025, letters of credit aggregating approximately £
253
 million originally issued under the 2022 GBP Agreement were deemed issued and outstanding under the 2025 GBP Agreement.
All borrowings under the 2025 USD Agreement bear interest at one of two per annum rate options selected by the borrower, being either an alternate base rate (as defined), plus a margin varying from 
0.0
% to 
0.675
% (Base Rate Margin), or an adjusted term SOFR rate (as defined), plus a margin varying from 
1.00
% to 
1.675
% (Applicable Margin). All borrowings under the 2025 GBP Agreement bear interest with respect to any business day at an adjusted rate per annum determined by reference to the Sterling Overnight Index Average with respect to such business day published by the Bank of England, plus the Applicable Margin.
Each 2025 Agreement also requires the borrower to pay quarterly (i) a facility fee on total commitments at a per annum rate that varies from 
0.125
% to 
0.325
% and (ii) a commission on the face amount of each outstanding letter of credit at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect.  Customary letter of credit fronting fees and other charges are payable to issuing banks.
Margins and facility fees are at varying rates per annum determined by reference to the senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced, long-term indebtedness for borrowed money of APA, or if such indebtedness is not rated and the Apache guaranty is in effect, of Apache (Long-Term Debt Rating). APA’s Long-Term Debt Rating currently applies, and the Base Rate Margin is 
0.30
%, the Applicable Margin is 
1.30
%, and the facility fee is 
0.20
%.
Borrowers under each 2025 Agreement, which include certain subsidiaries of APA, may borrow, prepay, and reborrow loans and obtain letters of credit, and APA may obtain letters of credit for the account of its subsidiaries, in each case subject to representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default, such as:
•
A financial covenant requires APA to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 
65
% at the end of any fiscal quarter.
•
A negative covenant restricts the ability of APA and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on their hydrocarbon-related assets, with customary exceptions and exceptions for liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the U. S. and Canada; Liens on assets also are permitted if debt secured thereby does not exceed 
15
% of APA’s consolidated net tangible assets.

Negative covenants restrict APA’s ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, a borrower’s disposition of substantially all of its assets, prohibitions on the ability of certain subsidiaries to make payments to borrowers, and guarantees by APA or certain subsidiaries of debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.
•
Lenders may accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches; if a borrower or certain subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold, or has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold; or APA undergoes a specified change in control. Such acceleration and termination are automatic upon specified insolvency events of a borrower or certain subsidiaries.
The 2025 Agreements do not require collateral, do not have a borrowing base, do not permit lenders to accelerate maturity or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes, and do not have borrowing restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings.
Subsequent Event—APA Exchange and Tender Offers for Apache Indenture Debt
On January 10, 2025, the Company settled its private exchange and cash tender offers for certain notes and debentures issued by Apache under its indentures. The Company also then settled its private offering of new notes to fund in part its purchase of Apache notes in APA’s cash tender offers.  In settling these offerings pursuant to their respective terms:
•
A
PA issued new notes and debentures under its indentures in aggregate principal amounts of (i) $
2.5
 billion in exchange for Apache notes and debentures tendered and accepted in APA’s exchange offers, (ii) $
203
 million in exchange for Apache notes tendered in the cash tender offers in excess of the stated maximum purchase amount or series caps, and (iii) $
850
 million in the new notes offering, comprised of $
350
 million aggregate principal amount of APA’s 
6.10
% Notes due 2035 and $
500
 million aggregate principal amount of APA’s 
6.75
% Notes due 2055.
•
In addition to issuing the APA notes in the exchange offers, APA paid a total of $
2.5
 million in cash as part of the exchange consideration.
•
APA paid a total of $
869
 million in cash in the tender offers (comprised of tender offer consideration, exchange consideration for tendered notes exchanged, early participation premium, and accrued interest) for the aggregate $
1
 billion in principal amount of Apache notes tendered and accepted in the cash tender offers.
•
Net proceeds from the sale of the notes in APA’s new notes offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $
839
 million and used to fund in part APA’s purchase of Apache notes in APA’s cash tender offers.
•
Each series of APA notes and debentures issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers has the same interest rate, maturity date, and interest payment dates and the same optional redemption prices (if any) as the corresponding series of Apache notes and debentures for which they were exchanged.
•
Each series of APA notes and debentures issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers and new notes offering are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Apache until the first time that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under senior notes and debentures outstanding under Apache’s existing indentures is less than $
1
 billion.
•
APA entered into two registration rights agreements, one covering notes and debentures issued in APA’s exchange and tender offers and one covering notes issued in APA’s new notes offering (each a Registration Rights Agreement). These offerings were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act), in reliance upon an exemption therefrom, and the APA notes and debentures issued pursuant to such offers are subject to certain transfer restrictions. Each Registration Rights Agreement requires APA and Apache to use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be filed a registration statement with respect to a registered offer to exchange each series of APA notes issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers or new notes offering, as applicable, for registered notes issued by APA and guaranteed, if applicable, by Apache containing terms substantially identical in all material respects to the applicable series of APA notes issued in settlement of the exchange and tender offers or new notes offering (except that the registered notes will not contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions or any increase in annual interest rate) and (ii) cause such registration statement to become effective under the Securities Act.  If, among other events, such exchange offers are not completed on or prior to the 360th day following January 10, 2025, then additional interest will accrue on the principal amount of such registrable securities at a rate of 
0.25
% per annum for 
F-30
APA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
the first 90-day period beginning on the day immediately following such registration default (which rate will be increased by an additional 
0.25
% per annum for each subsequent 90-day period that such additional interest continues to accrue, provided that the rate at which such additional interest accrues may in no event exceed 
1.00
% per annum). To the extent Apache’s guarantee of the registrable securities is terminated in accordance with the terms of such guarantee, the registered notes will not be guaranteed by Apache, the exchange offer and registration requirements with respect thereto will be the sole obligation of the Company, and Apache will automatically be released from all obligations under the applicable Registration Rights Agreement.
The following table presents the aggregate principal amounts of notes and debentures outstanding under indentures of APA and Apache on January 10, 2025 upon settlement of the APA’s exchange and tender offers and new notes offering (Apache notes due 2025 were not included in APA’s exchange or tender offers):

On April 1, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of Callon in an all-stock transaction. The Company’s deferred tax asset increased by approximately $
565
 million as part of the assets assumed through the Callon acquisition. Refer to 
Note 2— Acquisitions and Divestitures
 for further detail.
On July 14, 2022, the Energy (Oil and Gas) Profits Levy Act of 2022 (the Energy Profits Levy) was enacted, receiving Royal Assent. Under the law, an additional levy was assessed at a 25 percent rate, effective for the period of May 26, 2022 through December 31, 2025. The Finance Act 2023 included amendments to the Energy Profits Levy that increased the levy from a 25 percent rate to a 35 percent rate, effective for the period of January 1, 2023 through March 31, 2028. As a result, the Company recorded a deferred tax expense of $
174
 million and $
208
 million related to the remeasurement of the U.K. deferred tax liability in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The IRA includes a new 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on applicable corporations with an average annual adjusted financial statement income that exceeds $1.0 billion for any three consecutive years preceding the tax year at issue. The CAMT is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The Company became an applicable corporation subject to CAMT beginning on January 1, 2024. On September 12, 2024, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released proposed regulations relating to the application and implementation of CAMT. In 2024, the Company accrued tax expense of $
74
 million, which results in a tax credit that can be carried forward indefinitely to offset regular federal income tax expense in subsequent years. 
In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development issued Pillar Two Model Rules introducing a new global minimum tax of 15 percent on a country-by-country basis, with certain aspects effective in certain jurisdictions on January 1, 2024. Although the Company continues to monitor enacted legislation to implement these rules in countries where the Company could be impacted, the Company does not expect that the Pillar Two framework will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

four million
 of its Kinetik Shares, and on March 18, 2024, the remaining Kinetik Shares were sold. In 2022, the Company recorded tax expense of $
126
 million associated with the BCP Business Combination. The tax impact of the BCP Business Combination was fully offset by a change in valuation allowance. Refer to 
Note 2— Acquisitions and Divestitures
 for further detail.
Deferred tax assets are recorded for future deductible amounts and certain other tax benefits, such as net operating losses, tax credits and other tax attributes, provided that the Company assesses the utilization of such assets to be “more likely than not.” The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the existing deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, the Company has recorded valuation allowances for certain net operating losses, foreign tax credits and capital loss carryforwards that it does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.
During the fourth quarter of 2023, as a result of increases in projections of future taxable income and the absence of objective negative evidence such as a cumulative loss in recent years, the Company determined there was sufficient positive evidence to release a majority of the U.S. valuation allowance, which resulted in a non-cash deferred income tax benefit of $
1.7
 billion.

Net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after 2017 are subject to an 80 percent taxable income limitation with indefinite carryover under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company also has state net operating losses of $

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Legal Matters
The Company is party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, including litigation and governmental and regulatory controls, which also may include controls related to the potential impacts of climate change. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has an accrued liability of approximately $
20
 million for all legal contingencies that are deemed to be probable of occurring and can be reasonably estimated. The Company’s estimates are based on information known about the matters and its experience in contesting, litigating, and settling similar matters. Although actual amounts could differ from management’s estimate, none of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity after consideration of recorded accruals. With respect to material matters for which the Company believes an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, the Company has disclosed the nature of the matter and a range of potential exposure, unless an estimate cannot be made at this time. It is management’s opinion that the loss for any other litigation matters and claims that are reasonably possible to occur will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
Louisiana Restoration

Louisiana surface owners often file lawsuits or assert claims against oil and gas companies, including the Company, claiming that operators and working interest owners in the chain of title are liable for environmental damages on the leased premises, including damages measured by the cost of restoration of the leased premises to its original condition, regardless of the value of the underlying property. From time to time, restoration lawsuits and claims are resolved by the Company for amounts that are not material to the Company, while new lawsuits and claims are asserted against the Company. With respect to each of the pending lawsuits and claims, the amount claimed is not currently determinable or is not material. Further, the overall exposure related to these lawsuits and claims is not currently determinable. While adverse judgments against the Company are possible, the Company intends to actively defend these lawsuits and claims.
Starting in November of 2013 and continuing into 2023, several parishes in Louisiana have pending lawsuits against many oil and gas producers, including the Company. In these cases, the Parishes, as plaintiffs, allege that defendants’ oil and gas exploration, production, and transportation operations in specified fields were conducted in violation of the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended, and applicable regulations, rules, orders, and ordinances promulgated or adopted thereunder by the Parish or the State of Louisiana. Plaintiffs allege that defendants caused substantial damage to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. Plaintiffs seek, among other things, unspecified damages for alleged violations of applicable law within the coastal zone, the payment of costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate, detoxify, and otherwise restore the subject coastal zone as near as practicable to its original condition, and actual restoration of the coastal zone to its original condition. Without acknowledging or admitting any liability and solely to avoid the expense and uncertainty of future litigation, the Company agreed to settle with the State of Louisiana and Louisiana coastal Parishes to resolve any potential liability on the part of the Company for claims that were or could have been asserted by the coastal Parishes and/or the State of Louisiana in the pending litigation. The consideration paid by the Company in the settlement did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position. Following settlement of these various lawsuits, the Company will be a defendant in only one remaining coastal zone lawsuit, which was filed by the City of New Orleans against the Company and a number of oil and gas operators.

Apollo Exploration Lawsuit
In a case captioned 
Apollo Exploration, LLC, Cogent Exploration, Ltd. Co. & SellmoCo, LLC v. Apache Corporation
, Cause No. CV50538 in the 385
th
 Judicial District Court, Midland County, Texas, plaintiffs alleged damages in excess of $
200
 million (having previously claimed in excess of $
1.1
 billion) relating to purchase and sale agreements, mineral leases, and area of mutual interest agreements concerning properties located in Hartley, Moore, Potter, and Oldham Counties, Texas. The trial court entered final judgment in favor of the Company, ruling that the plaintiffs take nothing by their claims and awarding the Company its attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in defending the lawsuit. The court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court’s judgment thereby reinstating some of plaintiffs’ claims. The Texas Supreme Court granted the Company’s petition for review and heard oral argument in October 2022. On April 28, 2023, the Texas Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals’ decision and remanded the case back to the court of appeals for further proceedings. After plaintiffs’ request for rehearing, on July 21, 2023, the Texas Supreme Court reaffirmed its reversal of the court of appeals’ decision and remand of the case back to the court of appeals for further proceedings.
Australian Operations Divestiture Dispute
Pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated April 9, 2015 (Quadrant SPA), the Company and its subsidiaries divested Australian operations to Quadrant Energy Pty Ltd (Quadrant). Closing occurred on June 5, 2015. In April 2017, the Company filed suit against Quadrant for breach of the Quadrant SPA. In its suit, the Company seeks approximately AUD $
80
 million. In December 2017, Quadrant filed a defense of equitable set-off to the Company’s claim and a counterclaim seeking approximately AUD $
200
 million in the aggregate. The Company will vigorously prosecute its claim while vigorously defending against Quadrant’s counter claims.
Delaware Litigation
On September 10, 2020, the State of Delaware filed suit, individually and on behalf of the people of the State of Delaware, against over 
25
 oil and gas companies alleging damages as a result of global warming. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. The Company is vigorously defending the suit.
Kulp Minerals Lawsuit
On or about April 7, 2023, Apache was sued in a purported class action in New Mexico styled 
Kulp Minerals LLC v. Apache Corporation
, Case No. D-506-CV-2023-00352 in the Fifth Judicial District. The 
Kulp Minerals
 case has not been certified and seeks to represent a group of owners allegedly owed statutory interest under New Mexico law as a result of purported late oil and gas payments. The amount of this claim is not yet reasonably determinable. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in this lawsuit.
Environmental Matters
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an undiscounted reserve for environmental remediation of approximately $
2
 million. 
The Company is not aware of any environmental claims existing as of December 31, 2024, that have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that current regulatory requirements will not change or past non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the Company’s properties.
Potential Decommissioning Obligations on Sold Properties
In 2013, Apache sold its Gulf of America (GOA) Shelf operations and properties and its GOA operating subsidiary, GOM Shelf LLC (GOM Shelf) to Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood). Fieldwood assumed the obligation to decommission the properties held by GOM Shelf and the properties acquired from Apache and its other subsidiaries (collectively, the Legacy GOA Assets). On February 14, 2018, Fieldwood filed for (and subsequently emerged from) Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On August 3, 2020, Fieldwood filed for (and subsequently emerged from) Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for a second time. Upon emergence from this second bankruptcy, 
the Legacy GOA Assets were separated into a standalone company, which was subsequently merged into GOM Shelf. Under GOM Shelf’s limited liability company agreement, the proceeds of production of the Legacy GOA Assets are to be used to fund the operation of GOM Shelf and the decommissioning of Legacy GOA Assets.

Pursuant to the terms of the original transaction, as amended in the first bankruptcy, 
the securing of the asset retirement obligations for the Legacy GOA Assets as and when Apache is required to perform or pay for any such decommissioning was 
F-37
APA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
accomplished through the posting of letters of credit in favor of Apache (Letters of Credit), the provision of 
two
 bonds (Bonds) in favor of Apache, and the establishment of a trust account of which Apache was a beneficiary and which was funded by net profits interests (NPIs) depending on future oil prices. In addition, after such sources have been exhausted, Apache agreed upon resolution of GOM Shelf’s second bankruptcy to provide a standby loan to GOM Shelf of up to $
400
 million to perform decommissioning, with such standby loan secured by a first and prior lien on the Legacy GOA Assets.
By letter dated April 5, 2022 (replacing 
two
 earlier letters) and by subsequent letter dated March 1, 2023, GOM Shelf notified the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) that it was unable to fund the decommissioning obligations that it was obligated to perform on certain of the Legacy GOA Assets. As a result, Apache and other current and former owners in these assets have received orders from BSEE and demands from third parties to decommission certain of the Legacy GOA Assets included in GOM Shelf’s notifications to BSEE. Apache expects to receive similar orders and demands on the other Legacy GOA Assets included in GOM Shelf’s notification letters. Apache has also received orders to decommission other Legacy GOA Assets that were not included in GOM Shelf’s notification letters. Further, Apache anticipates that GOM Shelf may send additional such notices to BSEE in the future and that it may receive additional orders from BSEE requiring it to decommission other Legacy GOA Assets.
On June 21, 2023, 
two
 sureties that issued Bonds directly to Apache and 
two
 sureties that issued bonds to the issuing bank on the Letters of Credit filed suit against Apache in a case styled 
Zurich American Insurance Company, HCC International Insurance Company PLC, Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company and Everest Reinsurance Company (Insurers) v. Apache Corporation
, Cause No. 2023-38238 in the 281
st
 Judicial District Court, Harris County Texas. The sureties sought to prevent Apache from drawing on the $
148
 million in Bonds and $
350
 million in Letters of Credit and further alleged that they are discharged from their reimbursement obligations related to decommissioning costs and are entitled to other relief. On July 20, 2023, the 281
st
 Judicial District Court denied the Insurers’ request for a temporary injunction. On July 26, 2023, Apache removed the suit to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division). Since the time the sureties filed their state court lawsuit, Apache has drawn down the entirety of the $
350
 million in Letters of Credit. Apache has also sought to draw down on the Bonds; however, the sureties refused to honor such Bond draws. On September 12, 2024, the bankruptcy court issued its opinion (1) finding that sureties’ state court lawsuit against Apache was void; (2) holding that Apache’s claims against the sureties for unpaid amounts may proceed in bankruptcy court; and (3) holding the sureties in civil contempt and awarding attorneys’ fees to Apache as a sanction. The parties settled their dispute in the first quarter of 2025, which resulted in, among other things, mutual releases, the retention by Apache of all amounts drawn on the Letters of Credit, and payment to Apache of $
140
 million under the Bonds.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded an asset of $
178
 million representing the remaining amount the Company expects to be reimbursed from security related to these decommissioning costs. Of the total asset recorded as of December 31, 2024, $
21
 million is reflected under the caption “Decommissioning security for sold Gulf of America properties,” and $
157
 million is reflected under “Other current assets” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
As of December 31, 2024, Apache estimates that its potential liability to fund the remaining decommissioning of Legacy GOA Assets and assets previously sold to other operators ranges from $
1.0
 billion to $
1.4
 billion on an undiscounted basis. Management does not believe any specific estimate within this range is a better estimate than any other. Accordingly, the Company recorded contingent liabilities in the amounts of $
1.0
 billion and $
824
 million as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the total liability recorded as of December 31, 2024, $
929
 million is reflected under the caption “Decommissioning contingency for sold Gulf of America properties” and $
88
 million is reflected under “Other current liabilities” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Changes in significant assumptions impacting Apache’s estimated liability, including expected well decommissioning spread rates, derrick barge rates, and planned abandonment logistics, could result in a liability in excess of the amount accrued.
The Company recognized $
273
 million of “Losses on previously sold Gulf of America properties” during 2024 to reflect the net impact of an increase in estimated decommissioning costs of Legacy GOA Assets which BSSE may order the Company to decommission. The loss includes $
67
 million related to properties previously sold to third parties other than Fieldwood for which the Company received BSSE orders to decommission during the year, as well as an increase to the estimated net liability the Company expects to incur for decommissioning Legacy GOA Assets. The Company also recognized losses on previously sold Gulf of America properties of $
212
 million and $
157
 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively, in the Company’s statement of consolidated operations.

Leases and Contractual Obligations
The Company determines if an arrangement is an operating or finance lease at the inception of each contract. If the contract is classified as an operating lease, the Company records an ROU asset and corresponding liability reflecting the total remaining present value of fixed lease payments over the expected term of the lease agreement. The expected term of the lease may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. If the Company’s lease does not provide an implicit rate in the contract, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate when calculating the present value. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various lease agreements for real estate, drilling rigs, vessels, aircrafts, and equipment related to its exploration and development activities, which are typically classified as operating leases under the provisions of the standard. ROU assets are reflected within “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, and the associated operating lease liabilities are reflected within “Other current liabilities” and “Other” within “Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities,” as applicable.
Operating lease expense associated with ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease expense is reflected on the statement of consolidated operations commensurate with the leased activities and nature of the services performed. Gross fixed operating lease expense, inclusive of amounts billable to partners and other working interest owners, was $
170
 million, $
168
 million, and $
145
 million for the years ended 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As allowed under the standard, the Company accounts for non-lease and lease components as a single lease component for all asset classes and has elected to exclude short-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) from the balance sheet presentation. Costs incurred for short-term leases were $
85
 million, $
71
 million, and $
62
 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In 2024 these costs primarily related to short term drilling rigs in the U.S. and decommissioning work in the Gulf of America. In 2023 these costs primarily related to decommissioning work in the Gulf of America. In 2022, these costs were primarily related to drilling activities in Block 58 offshore Suriname. 
Finance lease assets are included in “Property and Equipment” on the consolidated balance sheet, and the associated finance lease liabilities are reflected within “
Current debt
” and “
Long-term debt
,” as applicable. Depreciation on the Company’s finance lease asset was $
2
 million in each of the years 2024, 2023, and 2022. Interest on the Company’s finance lease liability was $
1
 million, $

RETIREMENT AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS
The Company provides retirement benefits to its U.S. employees through the use of multiple plans: a 401(k) savings plan, a money purchase retirement plan, a non-qualified retirement savings plan, and a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. The 401(k) savings plan provides participating employees the ability to elect to contribute up to 
50
 percent of eligible compensation to the plan with the Company making matching contributions up to a maximum of 
8
 percent of each employee’s annual eligible compensation. In addition, the Company contributes 
6
 percent of each participating employee’s annual eligible compensation to a money purchase retirement plan. The 401(k) savings plan and the money purchase retirement plan are subject to certain annually-adjusted, government-mandated restrictions that limit the amount of employee and Company contributions. For certain eligible employees, the Company also provides a non-qualified retirement savings plan or a non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan. These plans allow the deferral of up to 
50
 percent of each employee’s base salary, up to 
75
 percent of each employee’s annual bonus (that accepts employee contributions) and the Company’s matching contributions in excess of the government mandated limitations imposed in the 401(k) savings plan and money purchase retirement plan.
Vesting in the Company’s contributions in the 401(k) savings plan, the money purchase retirement plan, the non-qualified retirement savings plan and the non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan occurs at the rate of 
20
 percent for every completed year of employment. Upon a change in control of ownership of APA, immediate and full vesting occurs.
The aggregate annual cost to the Company of all U.S. and international

savings plans, the money purchase retirement plan, non-qualified retirement savings plan, and non-qualified restorative retirement savings plan was $
46
 million, $
44
 million, and $
40
 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
The Company also provides a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (U.K. Pension Plan) covering certain employees of the Company’s North Sea operations in the U.K. The plan provides defined pension benefits based on years of service and final salary. The plan applies only to employees who were part of BP North Sea’s pension plan as of April 2, 2003, prior to the acquisition of BP North Sea by the Company effective July 1, 2003.
Additionally, the Company offers postretirement medical benefits to U.S. employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Eligible participants receive medical benefits up until the age of 65 or at the date they become eligible for Medicare, provided the participant remits the required portion of the cost of coverage. The plan is contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted annually. The postretirement benefit plan does not cover benefit expenses once a covered participant becomes eligible for Medicare.

The Company’s defined benefit pension plan assets are held by a non-related trustee who has been instructed to invest the assets under a cash flow driven investment strategy. The Company intends to invest in primarily low risk debt securities that will provide a reasonable rate of return focused on cash flow timing such that the benefits promised to members are provided when due. The U.K. Pension Plan policy is to target an ongoing funding level of 
100
 percent through prudent investments and includes policies and strategies such as investment goals, risk management practices, and permitted and prohibited investments. 
A breakout of allocations for the Company's plan asset holdings are summarized below:

Stock Compensation Plans
The Company maintains several stock-based compensation plans, which include stock options, restricted stock, and conditional restricted stock unit plans. 
On May 12, 2016, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2016 Omnibus Compensation Plan (the 2016 Plan), which is used to provide eligible employees with equity-based incentives by granting incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, performance awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, cash awards, or any combination of the foregoing. As of December 31, 2024, 
7.9
 million shares were authorized and available for grant under the 2016 Plan. Previously approved plans remain in effect solely for the purpose of governing grants still outstanding that were issued prior to approval of the 2016 Plan. All new grants are issued from the 2016 Plan. In 2018, the Company began issuing cash-settled awards (phantom units) under the restricted stock and conditional restricted stock unit plans. The phantom units represent a hypothetical interest in the Company’s stock and, once vested, are settled in cash.

Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Phantom Units
The Company has restricted stock unit and restricted stock phantom unit plans for eligible employees, including officers. The value of the stock-settled restricted stock unit awards is established by the market price on the date of grant and is recorded as compensation expense ratably over the vesting terms. The restricted stock phantom unit awards represent a hypothetical interest in either the Company’s common stock or, prior to the BCP Business Combination, in ALTM’s common stock, as applicable, and, once vested, are settled in cash. Compensation expense related to the cash-settled awards is recorded as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period over the applicable vesting term.

The outstanding liability for the unvested cash-settled restricted stock phantom units that had not been recognized as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $
34
 million.
In January 2025, the Company awarded 
693,761
 restricted stock units and 
2,300,091
 restricted stock phantom units based on APA’s weighted-average per-share market price of $
23.68
 under the 2016 Plan to eligible employees. Total compensation cost for the restricted stock units and the restricted stock phantom units, absent any forfeitures, is estimated to be $
16
 million and $
54
 million, respectively, and was calculated based on the per-share fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock as of the grant date. Compensation cost will be recognized over a 
three-year
 vesting period for both plans. The restricted stock phantom units will be classified as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the change in fair value of 
one
 share of the Company’s common stock, a Level 1 fair value measurement.

APA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
Performance Program
To provide long-term incentives for the Company’s employees to deliver competitive shareholder returns, the Company makes annual grants of cash-settled conditional restricted stock phantom units to eligible employees. APA has a performance program for certain eligible employees with payout for a portion of the shares based upon measurement of total shareholder return (TSR) of APA common stock as compared to a designated peer group during a 
three-year
 performance period. Payout for the remaining portion of the shares is based on performance and financial objectives as defined in the plan. The overall results of the objectives are calculated at the end of the award’s stated performance period and, if a payout is warranted, applied to the target number of restricted stock units awarded. The performance shares will immediately vest 
50
 percent at the end of the 
three-year
 performance period, with the remaining 
50
 percent vesting at the end of the following year. Grants from the performance programs outstanding at December 31, 2024, are as described below:
•
In January 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2021 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received the initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 
1,959,856
 units. A total of 
1,051,688
 phantom units were outstanding as of December 31, 2024. The results for the performance period yielded a payout of 
118
 percent of target.
•
In January 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2022 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received the initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 
1,093,034
 units. A total of 
998,570
 phantom units were outstanding as of December 31, 2024. The results for the performance period yielded a payout of 
118
 percent of target.
•
In January 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2023 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received the initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 
822,200
 units. The actual number of phantom units awarded will be between 
zero
 and 
200
 percent of target. A total of 
718,288
 phantom units were outstanding as of December 31, 2024, from which a minimum of 
zero
 to a maximum of 
1,436,576
 units could be awarded.
•
In January 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2024 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. Eligible employees received the initial cash-settled conditional phantom units totaling 
645,318
 units. The actual number of phantom units awarded will be between 
zero
 and 
200
 percent of target. A total of 
571,498
 phantom units were outstanding as of December 31, 2024, from which a minimum of 
zero
 to a maximum of 
1,142,996
 units could be awarded. Eligible employees also received cash incentives as part of the 2024 Performance Program, which totaled $
13
 million as of December 31, 2024. The ultimate payout will range from 
zero
 to $
26
 million at the end of a 
three-year
 performance period.
Compensation costs related to the conditional cash-settled awards are recorded as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period over the applicable vesting term. Compensation costs charged to expense under the cash-settled performance programs were a net benefit of $
13
 million during 2024 and expenses of $
2
 million and $
143
 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively. Capitalized compensation costs under the cash-settled performance programs were a net benefit of approximately $
1
 million during 2024 and expenses of approximately $
100
 thousand and $
21
 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
The following table summarizes cash-settled conditional restricted stock phantom unit activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:

APA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
In January 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2025 Performance Program, pursuant to the 2016 Plan. A portion of the award is based upon measurement of TSR similar to prior year awards, and the remaining portion of the award is based on performance and financial objectives as defined in the 2025 Performance Program. Eligible employees received conditional phantom units and cash incentives. The conditional phantom units totaled 
985,553
 units, with the ultimate units to be awarded ranging from 
zero
 to a maximum of 
1,971,106
 units. These phantom units represent a hypothetical interest in the Company’s common stock, and, once vested, are settled in cash. These phantom units will be classified as a liability and remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the change in fair value of 
one
 share of the Company’s common stock, a Level 1 fair value measurement. The cash incentives totaled $
16
 million, with the ultimate payout ranging from 
zero
 to $
32
 million. Final payout of the awards will be determined at the end of a 
three-year
 performance period.

MAJOR CUSTOMERS
The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. During 2024, sales to EGPC accounted for approximately 
17
 percent of the Company’s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs revenues. During each of 2023 and 2022, sales to EGPC accounted for approximately 
15
 percent of the Company’s worldwide crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs revenues.
Management does not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations.

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries are engaged in exploration, development and/or production activities across 
four
 operating segments: Egypt, North Sea, Suriname, and the U.S. The Company’s business explores for, develops, and produces crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. The Company also has exploration interests in Uruguay, Alaska, and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. Prior to the deconsolidation of Altus on February 22, 2022, the Company’s Midstream business was operated by ALTM, which owned, developed, and operating a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is a function (not necessarily an individual) that allocates the resources of the reporting entity and assesses the performance of its segments. Decisions to assess performance and allocate resources are made by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr. John J. Christmann, IV. Therefore, management has concluded that the CEO of the Company is the CODM. The information regularly reviewed by the CODM to assess performance and allocate resources is primarily associated with operating income from each segment and the resulting free cash flow, amongst other metrics. The Company concluded that the most comparable measure under U.S. GAAP is operating income.
Financial information for each segment is presented below:

Oil and Gas Reserve Information
Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.
Estimated reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques are included in the “proved” classification when successful testing by a pilot project or the operation of an active, improved recovery program using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty for the engineering analysis on which the project or program is based. Economically producible means a resource that generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. Reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating its proved reserves, the Company uses several different traditional methods that can be classified in three general categories: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy with similar properties. The Company will, at times, utilize additional technical analysis such as computer reservoir models, petrophysical techniques, and proprietary 3-D seismic interpretation methods to provide additional support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this additional analysis is combined with traditional methods outlined above to enhance the certainty of the Company’s reserve estimates.

 MMboe as of December 31, 2024, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, attributable to a noncontrolling interest in Egypt.
During 2024, the Company added approximately 
325
 MMboe from extensions, discoveries, and other additions. The Company recorded 
223
 MMboe of exploration and development adds in the U.S., derived from drilling activity in the Permian Basin targeting the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and Spraberry producing horizons. International operations contributed 
102
 MMboe of exploration and development adds, with Egypt contributing 
28
 MMboe from onshore exploration and appraisal and 
74
 MMboe from the Suriname final investment decision (FID).
The Company realized combined downward revision of previously estimated reserves of 
74
 MMboe. Negative revision related to pricing and interest totaled 
99
 MMboe, driven primarily by depressed Permian Basin gas pricing. This downward revision was partially offset by engineering and performance upward revisions totaling 
25
 MMboe. The U.S. and Egypt contributed upward revision of 
47
 MMboe, offset by negative revision of 
22
 MMboe in the North Sea.
F-59
APA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
During 2023, the Company added approximately 
112
 MMboe from extensions, discoveries, and other additions. The Company recorded 
96
 MMboe of exploration and development adds in the U.S., comprising 
67
 MMboe in the Permian Basin, 
27
 MMboe in the Delaware Basin, and 
2
 MMboe in the Texas Gulf Coast. Drilling programs for the Permian and Delaware Basins include the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and Spraberry with the Austin Chalk as the primary focus for the Texas Gulf Coast. International operations contributed 
16
 MMboe of exploration and development adds, with Egypt contributing 
15
 MMboe from onshore exploration and appraisal activity primarily in the Khalda Area and 
1
 MMboe from the North Sea. The Company had combined downward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 
46
 MMboe, primarily driven by revisions in the U.S. Downward revisions for price and interest changes accounted for 
83
 MMboe, partially offset by engineering and performance upward revisions of 
37
 MMboe.
During 2022, the Company added approximately 
34
 MMboe from extensions, discoveries, and other additions. The Company recorded 
22
 MMboe of exploration and development adds in the U.S., comprising 
9
 MMboe in the Permian Basin, 
8
 MMboe in the Texas Gulf Coast, and 
5
 MMboe in the Delaware Basin. Drilling programs for the Permian and Delaware Basins include the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and Spraberry with the Austin Chalk as the primary focus for the Texas Gulf Coast. International operations contributed 
12
 MMboe of exploration and development adds, with Egypt contributing 
9
 MMboe from onshore exploration and appraisal activity primarily in the Khalda Area and 
3
 MMboe from the North Sea. The Company had combined upward revisions of previously estimated reserves of 
75
 MMboe. Upward revisions related to miscellaneous changes accounted for 
5
 MMboe. Engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for 
70
 MMboe, with Egypt accounting for an increase of 
43
 MMboe, primarily the result of PSC modernization in Egypt. The North Sea contributed 
9
 MMboe of upward revisions from well performance and reactivations in both the Beryl and Forties programs. In the United States, the Company experienced positive revisions of 
18
 MMboe. The Company acquired 
39
 MMboe of proved reserves during 2022, primarily in the Delaware Basin. The Company also sold 
26
 MMboe of proved reserves associated with U.S. divestitures, primarily related to Permian Basin assets.
Approximately 
11
 percent of the Company’s year-end 2024 estimated proved developed reserves are classified as proved not producing. These reserves relate to zones that are either behind pipe, or that have been completed but not yet produced, or zones that have been produced in the past, but are not now producing because of mechanical reasons. These reserves are considered to be a lower tier of reserves than producing reserves because they are frequently based on volumetric calculations rather than performance data. Future production associated with behind pipe reserves is scheduled to follow depletion of the currently producing zones in the same wellbores. Additional capital may have to be spent to access these reserves. The capital and economic impact of production timing are reflected in this Note 17, under “Future Net Cash Flows.”
Future Net Cash Flows
Future cash inflows as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of oil and gas prices in effect on the first day of each month in the respective year, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. Future development costs include abandonment and dismantlement costs.

APA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)
The following table sets forth unaudited information concerning future net cash flows for proved oil and gas reserves, net of income tax expense. Income tax expense has been computed using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available, under laws in effect as of December 31, 2024, and which relate to oil and gas producing activities. This information does not purport to present the fair market value of the Company’s oil and gas assets, but does present a standardized disclosure concerning possible future net cash flows that would result under the assumptions used.
