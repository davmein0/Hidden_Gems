General Development of Business
Gentex Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated as a Michigan corporation in 1974. The Company designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and supplies digital vision, connected car, dimmable glass, and fire protection technologies, including: automatic-dimming rearview and non-dimming mirrors and electronics for the automotive industry; dimmable aircraft windows for the aviation industry; and commercial smoke alarms and signaling devices for the fire protection industry. The Company’s largest business segment involves designing, developing, manufacturing and marketing interior and exterior automatic-dimming automotive rearview mirrors that utilize proprietary electrochromic technology to dim in proportion to the amount of headlight glare from trailing vehicle headlamps. Within this business segment, the Company also designs, develops and manufactures various electronics that are value added features to the interior and exterior automotive rearview mirrors as well as electronics for interior visors, overhead consoles, and other locations in the vehicle. The Company ships its products to all of the major automotive producing regions worldwide, which it supports with numerous sales, engineering and distribution locations worldwide.  
At its inception, the Company manufactured smoke detectors, a product line that has since evolved to include a variety of fire protection technologies. In the early 1980's, the Company introduced an interior electromechanical automatic-dimming rearview mirror as an alternative to the manual day/night rearview mirrors for automotive applications. In the late 1980's, the Company introduced an interior electrochromic automatic-dimming rearview mirror for automotive applications. In the early 1990's, the Company introduced an exterior electrochromic automatic-dimming rearview mirror for automotive applications. In the late 1990's, the Company began making volume shipments of three new exterior mirror sub-assembly products: thin glass flat; convex; and aspheric. In 2005, the Company began making volume shipments of its bezel-free exterior automatic dimming mirror.  In 2010 the Company began delivering electrochromic dimmable aircraft windows for the aviation industry.  In 2013, the Company acquired HomeLink
®
, a wireless vehicle/home communications product that enables drivers to remotely activate garage door openers, entry door locks, home lighting, security systems, entry gates and other radio frequency convenience products for automotive applications, wherein the Company had previously been a licensee of HomeLink

Further, the Company has announced an embedded biometric solution for vehicles that leverages iris scanning technology to create a secure environment in the vehicle.  There are many use cases for authentication, which range from vehicle security to start functionality to personalization of mirrors, music, seat location and temperature, to the ability to control transactions not only for the ITM
®
 system, but also the ride sharing car of the future.  The Company believes iris recognition is among the most secure forms of biometric identification, with a false acceptance rate as low as one in 10 million, far superior to facial, voice, and other biometric systems. The Company's future plans include integrating biometric authentication with many of its other electronic features, including HomeLink
®
 and HomeLink Connect
®
 or the ITM
®
.  The biometric system allows for added security and convenience for multiple drivers by adding an additional factor of authentication for increased security, when a driver (or passenger) enters a vehicle.

Note 7
 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Historically, new products and technologies have penetrated high-end vehicles and premium trim/option packages to begin. As consumer demand increases for such advanced technologies, more OEMs shift to offer a variety of trim packages and option packages for each of their vehicles, creating a range of available pricing and technologies across their lineups. In some instances, Company products, such as the FDM
®
, appeal to consumers who are interested in new technology, while also resolving rearward vision limitations created by vehicle design changes that increase aerodynamics. The Company has contributed to this differentiation strategy, allowing OEMs to maximize profitability and optionality by providing mirror-based and in-vehicle technologies that consumers demand.  As more consumers have become familiar with interior and exterior dimming mirrors, HomeLink
®
, FDM
®
, ITM
®
, and other Company technologies, consumers have continued to select these technologies in their subsequent vehicles, driving further market and nameplate penetration as OEMs launch new vehicles and expand into new markets. OEMs have historically used Company technologies only to differentiate from one another, but are now also using Company technologies to differentiate trim lines across their own nameplates. In new markets, emerging OEMs have recognized the need to include Company products in their vehicles to compete with global OEMs.
Automotive Rearview Mirrors and Electronics Competition.
 The Company continues to be the leading producer of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors in the world and currently is the largest supplier to the automotive industry with an approximate 86% market share worldwide in 2024. While the Company believes it will retain a significant position in automatic-dimming rearview mirrors for some time, another U.S. manufacturer, Magna Mirrors, a division of Magna, continues to compete for sales to domestic and foreign vehicle manufacturers and is supplying a number of domestic and foreign vehicle models with its versions of auto-dimming mirrors and appears to have considerably more resources available to it.  As such, Magna may present a formidable competitive threat. The Company also continues to sell automatic-dimming exterior mirror sub-assemblies to Magna Mirrors. In addition, a Japanese manufacturer (Tokai Rika) is currently supplying a few vehicle models in Japan with solid-state electrochromic mirrors. There are also Chinese domestic mirror suppliers that are marketing and selling automatic-dimming rearview mirrors, primarily within the domestic China automotive market. Moreover, other companies have  products that are competitive to the Company's FDM
®
 system, and Chinese domestic mirror suppliers have begun marketing and selling these products, within the domestic China market. Further, two Japan manufacturers (Murakami and Panasonic) have begun selling and marketing competitive FDM
®
 type products in Japan. The Company acknowledges that dimming device (e.g., electrochromic) technology is the subject of research and development efforts by numerous third parties. 
The Company believes its electrochromic automatic-dimming mirrors and mirrors with advanced electronic features offer significant performance advantages over competing products and the Company makes significant research and development investments to continue to increase and improve the performance advantages of its products and to potentially add new products.
There are numerous other companies in the world conducting research on various technologies, including electrochromics, for controlling light transmission and reflection. The Company currently believes that the electrochromic materials and manufacturing process it uses for automotive mirrors remains the most efficient and cost-effective way to produce these products. The Company has also continued to invest in new technologies to improve manufacturing processes. In 2020, the Company, in the ordinary course of business, completed the acquisition of Argil, Inc., an electrochromic technology and research and development company, which the 
5
Company anticipates using to complement and expand its product offerings and leverage for manufacturing efficiencies. While automatic-dimming mirrors using other technologies may eliminate glare, the Company currently believes that each of these other technologies have inherent cost or performance limitations as compared to the Company's technologies.
As the Company continues to expand its automatic-dimming mirror products with additional advanced electronic features and expands the capabilities of its: CMOS imager technology for additional features (i.e. SmartBeam
®
, FDM
®
, rear video camera, digital video recorder, etc.), hybrid and fully digital CMS technology, and driver and cabin monitoring systems, the Company recognizes that it is competing with considerably larger and more geographically diverse electronics companies that present a formidable competitive threat in the future as new products/features and technologies are brought to market.

DE&I efforts at the Company extend to the supply base as well, where the Company has been recognized for ongoing efforts to increase supplier relationships with certified minority, woman, veteran, and LGBTQ+-owned enterprises. In fact, the Company mentors certain such suppliers to help them develop the business systems and technological improvements necessary to support future growth. The Company is a member of, or otherwise involved in, the Michigan Minority Supplier Development Council, Original Equipment Supplier's Association - Diversity & Inclusion, Board of Governors, Consumer Technology Association - D&I Group, Michigan Diversity Connection, West Michigan Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and the Great Lakes Women's Business Council.
Hiring rates, voluntary and involuntary turnover rates, internal rates of hiring and promotion, and safety records are measures of the Company's success in human capital management. While hiring and diversity policies are in place to remain on track in terms of appropriate human resources management, the DE&I efforts have furthered the process of creating a welcoming environment so the Company can hire and retain the best people. The Company produces a Sustainability Report, referenced below, providing more information regarding diversity and corporate responsibility. To ensure an excellent and increasingly diverse employment base, the Company has added Spanish speaking manufacturing lines, which involve translating materials for recruiting, orientation, on-boarding, training, benefits and work instructions in the Spanish language. The Company’s Corporate Controller and Senior Director of Accounting was honored as one of the 25 Most Influential Latinos in West Michigan for her work to establish the Company’s Limited English Proficiency Program. The Company was also presented with a DE&I Champion Award from the MEMA Original Equipment Suppliers Association for championing the spirit of DEI within the organization and in the communities where its employees live. 
Moreover, the Company's DE&I efforts related to actively developing and using minority, women, and veteran-owned suppliers have been acknowledged and recognized by multiple OEM customers. In fact, Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing North America, Inc. has specifically recognized the Company's efforts over the last 10 years to increase supplier relationships with minority business enterprises. The Company has also won supplier diversity awards from Honda, Nissan, and Toyota.    
In 2022, the Company established the Gentex Foundation, which provides financial grants to organizations across the country in support of economic development, children's services, public health, housing assistance and diversity initiatives among other causes. The Gentex Foundation is managed by a board of directors that reviews grant applications with a particular focus on communities where Company employees live and work, consistent with the organization's values of integrity, compassion, innovation and diversity. Employees are encouraged to organize on-site fundraisers and to spend time volunteering at worthy charitable organizations in addition to giving financially.  Support is also provided to a number of minority organizations in keeping with the Company's DE&I efforts and to continue to build an even more diverse and skilled workforce.
The Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") and its committees have regular touchpoints with management regarding: employee engagement; workforce planning (including capabilities and skills development); safety; understanding workforce demographics and DE&I strategies; and corporate culture. The Board and management know that the right talent is required to implement the Company's strategies. As such, the Board and its committees work with management regarding the approach to, and investment in, human capital that includes recruitment, talent development, retention, and diversity. The Board and its committees have access to all levels of employees in the Company in its efforts to properly oversee human resources and DE&I issues. 
The Company's 
commitment to DE&I is very apparent by the inclusiveness of the Board.
 The Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee have taken concrete actions to increase Board diversity, including use of various resources and environments to identify qualified and diverse director candidates. Such candidates are contacted and interviewed in order to continue to build an even more diverse, qualified, and capable Board. In the Company's 2024 Proxy Statement, the Company disclosed Board diversity information in accordance with NASDAQ rules.
The Board has also implemented a Complaint Submission and Handling Policy for concerns to be raised as needed.
