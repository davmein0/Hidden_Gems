Overview

JFrog provides a hybrid, universal, end-to-end software supply chain platform for delivering trusted, secure software updates from code to production. Our goal is to function as the single source of truth for an organization’s software footprint, bridging digital gaps between developers, security teams, machine learning engineers, data scientists, and other business units to empower a world of always-on, always-current software which we refer to as “Liquid Software.” As of December 31, 2024, we had a global customer base of approximately 7,300 organizations across all industries and sizes, including approximately 82% of Fortune 100 organizations. All of the top 10 technology organizations and top 10 financial services organizations, 8 of the top 10 retail organizations, 8 of the top 10 healthcare organizations, and all of the top 5 telecommunications organizations in the Fortune 500 have adopted the JFrog platform, embarking on their journey towards Liquid Software. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our 10 largest customers represented approximately 8% of our total revenue and 40% of our revenue was generated from customers outside of the United States.

We have designed our subscription structure and go-to-market strategy to align our growth with the success of our customers. Our business model benefits from our ability to serve the needs of all customers, from individual software developers, security teams, MLOps teams, and IT operators to the largest organizations, in a value-oriented manner.

We generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to customers. We offer subscription tiers for self-managed deployments, where our customers deploy and manage our products across their public cloud, on-premise, private cloud, or hybrid environments, as well as JFrog-managed public cloud deployments, which we refer to as our SaaS subscriptions. Revenue from SaaS subscriptions contributed 39% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 34% for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Our self-managed subscriptions are offered on an annual and multi-year basis, and our SaaS subscriptions are offered on a monthly, annual, and multi-year basis. Revenue from Enterprise Plus subscription represented approximately 51% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to approximately 46% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The growth in revenue from our Enterprise Plus subscription demonstrates the increased demand for our end-to-end solutions for customers’ entire software supply chain management.

We have an unwavering commitment to the software developer, security teams, MLOps teams, and IT operator communities, and show this commitment by offering varying forms of free access to our products in addition to the paid subscriptions described above. This free access takes the form of free trials and open source software, and helps generate demand for our paid offerings within the software developer, security and IT operator communities.

Table of Contents

We generated revenue of $428.5 million and $349.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing year-over-year growth rate of 22%. We continued to invest in our business and had net loss of $69.2 million and $61.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Middle East Conflict

On October 7, 2023, Hamas militants and members of other terrorist organizations infiltrated Israel’s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of terror attacks on civilian and military targets. Following the attack, Israel’s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against these terrorist organizations. Since the commencement of these events, there have been additional active hostilities, including with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran, and most recently, the Houthi movement which controls parts of Yemen. The conflict has recently expanded into Lebanon and though ceasefires have been reached with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, it is possible that hostilities will resume without warning and escalate into a greater regional conflict, and that additional terrorist organizations and countries could actively join the hostilities.

Although we are domiciled in Israel, we are a global, cloud-based company, with operations spanning numerous countries with redundant infrastructure and code located outside of Israel. We have activated and maintained a comprehensive three-pillar business continuity plan and have taken the necessary steps which we believe are in line with such plan, in an effort to ensure that our operations and service to our customers remain consistent. The first pillar is our internal plan focused on the safety of our employees in Israel and maintaining internal communication channels. The second pillar revolves around technology to support continuity of our services, security, cyber defense, and research and development. The third pillar is dedicated to our external-facing activities to promote continuity of customer engagements, support and external communication. While certain of our employees and consultants have been called into military service, there has been no major interruption or material adverse impact on our operating results as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will continue to monitor the situation as it progresses.

Factors Affecting Our Performance

We believe that our future performance will depend on many factors, including the following:

Extending Our Technology Leadership

We intend to continue to enhance our hybrid, universal, end-to-end software supply chain platform by developing new products and expanding the functionality of existing products to maintain our technology leadership.

We invest heavily in integrating our products with the major package technologies so that our products can be easily adopted in any development environment. We believe that these integrations increase the value of our platform to our customers, as they provide freedom of choice for software developers, security teams, and IT operators and help avoid vendor lock-in. We intend to expend additional resources in the future to continue introducing new products, features, and functionality.

Expanding Usage by Existing Customers

We believe that there is a significant opportunity for growth with many of our existing customers. Many customers purchase our products through self-service channels and often materially expand their usage over time. Increased engagement with our products provides our support and customer success teams opportunities to work directly with customers and introduce them to additional products and features, as well as drive usage of our products across large teams and more broadly across organizations. Furthermore, we see expansion opportunities when customers migrate from self-managed subscriptions to SaaS solutions because customers have generally increased their platform usage levels after migration. We will continue to expand our strategic team to identify new use cases and drive expansion and standardization on JFrog within our largest customers, to maintain engineering-level customer support, and to introduce new products and features that are responsive to our customers’ needs.

We quantify our expansion across existing customers through our net dollar retention rate. Our net dollar retention rate compares our annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) from the same set of customers across comparable periods. We define ARR as the annualized revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all customers as of the last month of the quarter. The ARR includes monthly subscription customers so long as we generate revenue from these customers. We annualize our monthly subscriptions by taking the revenue we would contractually expect to receive from such customers in a given month and multiplying it by 12. We calculate net dollar retention rate by first identifying customers (the “Base Customers”), which were customers in the last month of a particular quarter (the “Base Quarter”). We then calculate the contracted ARR from these Base Customers in the last month of the same quarter of the subsequent year (the “Comparison Quarter”). This calculation captures

55

Table of Contents

upsells, contraction, and attrition since the Base Quarter. We then divide total Comparison Quarter ARR by total Base Quarter ARR for Base Customers. Our net dollar retention rate in a particular quarter is obtained by averaging the result from that particular quarter with the corresponding results from each of the prior three quarters. Our net dollar retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of penetration within our customer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our customers. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our net dollar retention rate was 116% and 119%, respectively. We expect our net dollar retention rate to remain relatively stable, with minor fluctuations around current levels.

We focus on growing the number of large customers as a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations to adopt our products. As of December 31, 2024, 1,018 of our customers had ARR of $100,000 or more, increasing from 886 customers as of December 31, 2023. We had 52 customers with ARR of at least $1.0 million as of December 31, 2024, increasing from 37 customers as of December 31, 2023.

Acquiring New Customers

We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow the number of customers that use our platform. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 32% of the Forbes Global 2000 were our customers. Our operating results and growth prospects will depend in part on our ability to attract new customers. To date, we have primarily relied on our self-service and inbound sales model to attract new customers. Prospective customers can evaluate and adopt our products through our free trials and open source software options. The costs associated with providing these free trials and open source software options are included in sales and marketing. While we believe we have a significant market opportunity that our platform addresses, we will need to continue to invest in customer support, research and development, and sales and marketing in order to address this opportunity.

Additionally, we believe our products address the software release needs of customers worldwide, and we see international expansion as a major opportunity. We have been operating and selling our products in international markets since our inception. While we believe global demand for our products will continue to increase as international market awareness of our brand grows, our ability to conduct our operations internationally will require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful in evaluating the performance of our business.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We believe this is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our core operations that, after the purchases of property and equipment, can be used for strategic initiatives, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening our balance sheet. Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Some of the limitations of free cash flow are that this metric does not reflect our future contractual commitments and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. We expect our free cash flow to fluctuate in future periods as we invest in our business to support our plans for growth.

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented and provides a reconciliation of net cash from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods presented:

Components of Results of Operations

Revenue

Our revenues are comprised of revenue from self-managed subscriptions and SaaS subscriptions. Subscriptions to our self-managed software include license, support, and upgrades and updates on a when-and-if-available basis. Our SaaS subscriptions provide access to our latest managed version of our product hosted in a public cloud.

Subscription—Self-Managed and SaaS

Subscription—self-managed and SaaS revenue is generated from the sale of subscriptions for our self-managed software products and the sale of our SaaS subscriptions. For subscriptions to our self-managed software products, revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term. For our SaaS subscriptions, revenue is recognized ratably over each commitment period within the subscription term, based on minimum usage commitments and any excess usage in the corresponding commitment period.

License—Self-Managed

The license component of our self-managed subscriptions reflects the revenue recognized by providing customers with access to proprietary software features. License revenue is recognized upfront when the software license is made available to our customer.

Cost of Revenue

Subscription—Self-Managed and SaaS

Cost of subscription—self-managed and SaaS revenue primarily consists of expenses related to providing support to our customers and cloud-related costs, such as hosting and managing costs. These costs primarily consist of personnel-related expenses of our services and customer support personnel, share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, public cloud infrastructure costs, depreciation of property and equipment, and allocated overhead. We expect our cost of subscription and SaaS revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our subscription and SaaS revenue increases.

License—Self-Managed

Cost of license self-managed revenue consists of amortization of acquired intangible assets.

Operating Expenses

Research and Development

Research and development costs primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, share-based compensation expenses, associated with our engineering personnel responsible for the design, development, and testing of our products, cost of development environments and tools, and allocated overhead. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase as we increase our research and development headcount to further strengthen and enhance our products and invest in the development of our software.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, share-based compensation expenses, sales commissions primarily associated with our sales and marketing organizations, public cloud infrastructure costs associated with our free trials and open source software options, and costs associated with marketing programs and user events. Marketing programs include advertising, promotional events, and brand-building activities. We plan to increase our investment in sales and marketing over the foreseeable future, as we continue to hire additional personnel and invest in sales and marketing programs.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, share-based compensation expenses, associated primarily with our finance, legal, human resources and other operational and administrative functions, professional

57

Table of Contents

fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services, directors and officer’s insurance expenses, and allocated overhead. We expect to increase the size of our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business.

Interest and Other Income, Net

Interest and other income, net primarily consists of income earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest and other income, net also includes foreign exchange gains and losses.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense consists primarily of income taxes related to the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in Israel as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. We may recognize tax benefits from the release of valuation allowance in connection with acquisitions that create deferred tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards, and changes in our valuation allowance.

Total cost of revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $9.9 million in third-party hosting costs primarily driven by increased revenue from SaaS subscriptions, an increase of $4.8 million in personnel-related expenses mainly as a result of increased headcount, an increase of $4.8 million in share-based compensation expense as discussed in the section titled 
“
Share-Based Compensation Expense
”
 below, and an increase of $4.0 million in intangible amortization mainly as a result of our acquisition of Qwak AI Ltd. (“Qwak”) in July 2024, partially offset by a decrease of $2.5 million in costs associated with software and subscription costs.

Gross margin slightly decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting a shift in our revenue mix, as SaaS subscriptions, which incur higher hosting costs, contributed to a lower overall margin.

The increase in share-based compensation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to grants to new and existing employees. Additionally, in 2024, we recognized $5.2 million share-based compensation expense primarily in research and development, related to Qwak acquisition holdback ordinary shares and replacement RSUs.

, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the provision for income taxes.

Income tax expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to higher excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards and a discrete tax benefit in Israel attributable to the release of valuation allowance as a result of recognizing deferred tax liabilities associated with the Qwak acquisition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and sales of equity securities. Our principal uses of cash in recent periods have been funding our operations, investing in capital expenditures, and business and asset acquisitions.

As of December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $522.0 million. Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash in banks and money market funds. Short-term investments generally consist of bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, municipal securities, and government and agency debt. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, together with cash provided by operations, will be sufficient to meet our needs for the next 12 months, as well as in the long-term.

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing, and extent of spending to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts, the continuing market acceptance of our products and services, as well as expenses associated with our international expansion, the timing, and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities of $110.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily related to our net loss of $69.2 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $155.0 million, including share-based compensation expense of $131.1 million and depreciation and amortization of $21.5 million, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $25.1 million. The total cash inflows of $74.0 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities were related to an increase of $60.1 million in deferred revenue and an increase of $13.8 million in accrued expense and other liabilities mainly due to higher accrued compensation and benefits and accrual for holdback payments related to Qwak acquisition. These inflows were partially offset by an increase of $13.5 million in accounts receivable, an increase of $12.1 million in net deferred contract acquisition costs, a decrease of $8.1 million in operating lease liabilities as a result of payments, an increase of $7.8 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a decrease of $7.3 million in accounts payable. The increases in deferred revenue, accounts receivable, and deferred contract acquisition costs were driven by higher sales. The changes in prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable were mainly due to timing of payments.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $74.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily related to our net loss of $61.3 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $112.1 million, including share-based compensation expense of $95.2 million and depreciation and amortization of $15.3 million, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $23.3 million. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily related to an increase of $38.4 million in deferred revenue and an increase of $10.7 million in accrued expense and other liabilities mainly due to higher accrued compensation and benefits, partially offset by an increase of $14.1 million in accounts receivable, an increase of $7.8 million in net deferred contract acquisition costs, and a decrease of $7.7 million in operating lease liabilities primarily as a result of payments. The increases in deferred revenue, accounts receivable, and deferred contract acquisition costs were driven by higher sales.

The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. Purchase obligations represent our commitments primarily for hosting services, software products and services under contracts with remaining terms of 12 months or longer. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity from our operations to fulfill the commitments.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates and assumptions may change materially in future periods. We believe our judgments and estimates associated with the determination of standalone selling price for each performance obligation in revenue recognition, accounting for business combinations, and accounting for income taxes, which we discuss further below, could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Please see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services are delivered. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these goods or services. Our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation. To determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation, we use observable standalone sales where available. In instances where observable standalone sales are not available, our estimate of the standalone selling price requires judgment. We consider multiple factors including market conditions, pricing strategies, the economic life of the software, and other observable inputs. We may also use the expected cost-plus margin approach to estimate the price we would charge if the products and services were sold separately. The standalone selling price is reassessed periodically or when facts and circumstances change.

63

Table of Contents

Business Combinations

Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets
. 
Critical estimates in valuing the acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from product sales, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. 
Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on histor
ical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.

Income taxes

We are subject to income taxes in Israel, the U.S., and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis, based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits, and effective settlement of audit issues.

Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. In assessing whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we consider all available evidence, including projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and past operating results. In the event that we change our determination, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

Item 7A. 
Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure about Market risk

We have operations in the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Our revenue and expenses are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Substantially all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore our revenue is not subject to significant foreign currency risk. However, a significant portion of our operating costs in Israel, consisting principally of salaries and related personnel expenses, and operating lease and facility expenses are denominated in NIS. This foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the U.S. dollar against the NIS. Since the beginning of the war between Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah, the volatility of NIS against the U.S. dollar has not materially affected the results of our business. We anticipate that a material portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in NIS.

To reduce the impact of foreign exchange risks associated with forecasted future cash flows and certain existing assets and liabilities and the volatility in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, we have established a hedging program. Foreign currency contracts are generally utilized in this hedging program. Our foreign currency contracts are generally short-term in duration. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We account for our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and carry them at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for changes in the fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Our hedging program reduces but does not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business, after considering our hedging programs, would not have had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. In addition, the financial institutions with which we have foreign currency contracts are primarily located in Israel, exposing us to risks related to the country's economic standing which may affect credit ratings. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions, spreading the risk across a number of major financial institutions, and closely monitoring rating downgrades. However, failure of one or more of these financial institutions is possible and could result in incurred losses.

64

Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments were primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. A 10% adverse change in current exchange rates would not have materially affected our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investment balances as of December 31, 2024.

Interest Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $49.9 million, and short-term investments of $472.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash in banks and money market funds. Short-term investments generally consist of bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, municipal securities, and government and agency debt. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held for working capital purposes. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs and the fiduciary control of cash. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact on their fair value as of December 31, 2024.

Inflation Risk

We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, other than its impact on the general economy. However, if our costs, in particular labor, sales and marketing, and hosting costs, were to become subject to inflationary pressures, we might not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of JFrog Ltd.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JFrog Ltd. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 14, 2025, expre
ssed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements, and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Revenue Recognition - Evaluation of SSPs for Self-managed subscription and license performance obligations

Description of the Matter

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized Self-managed subscription revenue and Self-managed license revenue of $238.9 million and $21.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis.

In establishing Standalone Selling Price ("SSP") for its Self-managed subscription and Self-managed license performance obligations the Company maximizes the use of observable standalone sales and observable data, where available. In instances where performance obligations do not have observable standalone sales, the Company utilizes available information that may include market conditions, pricing strategies, the economic life of the software, and the expected cost-plus margin approach to estimate the price the Company would charge if the products and services were sold separately, as applicable.

Auditing the management’s determination of the standalone selling price required challenging and subjective auditor judgment to evaluate the Company's inputs and factors used to estimate the SSPs, due to the subjective assumptions used to establish the standalone selling price for each performance obligation.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s revenue process, including controls over the development and review of assumptions used to determine the standalone selling prices.

Our audit procedures also included, among others, evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the data and factors used in managements determination of SSP and evaluating the methodologies used to develop the SSP for each performance obligation. We also tested the reasonableness of factors considered by management, such as historical sales, allocation of expenses, and appropriate margins. Furthermore, we evaluated the Company’s disclosures included in notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Business Combination

Description of the Matter

As describe in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, on July 9, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of Qwak AI Ltd. (Qwak) for total consideration of $177.5 million. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.

Auditing the Company's accounting for the Qwak acquisition was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value of the Developed Technology of $ 48.7 million (the "Intangible Asset").

The significant estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value of the developed technology was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Intangible Asset included discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results, such as revenue growth rates, profitability margins, obsolescence rate and discount rates. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

In our audit we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Qwak acquisition. This included testing controls over the estimation process supporting the recognition and measurement of the Intangible Asset, and management's judgment and evaluation of underlying assumptions and estimates.

To test the estimated fair value of the Intangible Asset, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the prospective financial information, evaluating the Company's selection of the

68

Table of Contents

valuation methodology, evaluating the methods and significant assumptions used by the Company, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates used. For example, we compared the significant assumptions to historical financial information, comparable companies and market and economic trends. We involved our valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology used by the Company and significant assumptions included in the fair value estimates. For example, our valuation specialists performed independent comparative calculations to estimate the acquired entity discount rate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of JFrog Ltd.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited JFrog Ltd.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, JFrog Ltd. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

As indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Qwak AI Ltd., which is included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted less than one percent of total assets as of December 31, 2024 and less than one percent of consolidated total net revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Qwak AI Ltd.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed 
an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.  Organization and 
Description of Business
JFrog Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, “JFrog”, or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel in 2008. 
JFrog provides a hybrid, universal, end-to-end software supply chain platform for delivering trusted, secure software updates from code to production. Its goal is to function as the single source of truth for an organization’s software footprint, bridging digital gaps between developers, security teams, machine learning engineers, data scientists, and other business units to empower a world of always-on, always-current software which the Company refers to as “Liquid Software.”

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of JFrog Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods and accompanying notes. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the allocation of transaction price among various performance obligations, the estimated benefit period of deferred contract acquisition costs, the allowance for credit losses, the fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the useful lives of acquired intangible assets and property and equipment, the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, and the valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. The Company bases these estimates on historical and anticipated results, trends and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency
The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the end-of-period exchange rates except for non-monetary assets and liabilities, which are measured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured each day at the exchange rate in effect on the day the transaction occurred. 
Gains or losses from foreign currency re-measurement and settlements are included in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Concentration of Risks
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and derivative instruments. The Company maintains its cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments with high-quality financial institutions mainly in the U.S. and Israel, and regularly monitors their composition and maturities. The Company’s derivatives expose it to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. The Company seeks to mitigate such risk by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across a number of major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. The Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses on customers’ accounts when deemed necessary.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, 
no
 single customer represented 
10
% or more of accounts receivable. 
No
 single customer accounted for more than 
10
% of total revenue for the periods presented.

77

Table of Contents

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase. The Company maintains certain cash amounts restricted as to its withdrawal or use. The Company’s restricted cash primarily consists of bank deposits collateralizing the Company’s credit cards and operating leases.
Short-Term Investments
Short-term investments consist of bank deposits and marketable securities. Bank deposits are time deposits with an original maturity of more than three months but less than one year from the date of investment. Bank deposits are presented at cost with accrued interest.
Marketable securities consist of fixed-income debt securities with maturity of greater than three months at the date of purchase. The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluates such classification at each balance sheet date. The Company may sell these securities at any time for use in current operations even if they have not yet reached maturity. As a result, the Company classifies its marketable securities, including those with maturities beyond 12 months, as current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company carries these securities at fair value and records unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) as a component of shareholders’ equity (deficit), except for changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which is recorded in interest and other income, net. Gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and recognized when realized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company periodically evaluates its available-for-sale debt securities for impairment. If the amortized cost of an individual security exceeds its fair value, the Company considers its intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized basis. If either of these criteria are met, the Company writes down the security to its fair value and records the impairment charge in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. If neither of these criteria are met, the Company determines whether credit loss exists. Credit loss is estimated by considering changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, as well as other factors.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company measures financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy which requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, accounts receivables, derivative financial instruments, accounts payables, and accrued liabilities. Cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and restricted cash are stated at fair value on a recurring basis. Bank deposits, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities are stated at their carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.

78

Table of Contents

Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable consists of invoiced amounts and unbilled receivables, net of allowance for credit losses. Unbilled receivables represent revenue recognized for which the Company expects to invoice subsequent to the period end. The allowance for credit losses is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectability of accounts. The Company regularly assessed collectability based on a combination of factors, including an assessment of the current customer’s aging balance, the nature and size of the customer, the financial condition of the customer, and the amount of any receivables in dispute. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses when identified. The allowance of credit losses was not material for the periods presented.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks, mainly the exposure to changes in the exchange rate of the New Israeli Shekel (“NIS”) against the U.S. dollar that are associated with forecasted future cash flows and certain existing assets and liabilities for up to twelve months. The Company’s primary objective in entering into these contracts is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
The Company recognizes its derivative instruments as either prepaid expenses and other current assets or accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and carries them at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in AOCI in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. Upon occurrence, the Company reclassifies the related gains or losses on the derivative to the same financial statement line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to which the derivative relates. In case the Company discontinues cash flow hedges, it records the related amount in interest and other income, net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in the fair value of assets or liabilities are currently not designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes. The Company records changes in the fair value of these derivatives in interest and other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
The cash flows from the derivative instruments are recorded in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Cost to Obtain a Contract
The Company capitalizes sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to sales personnel and commissions paid to channel partners that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract acquisition costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company determines whether costs should be deferred based on its sales compensation plans and channel partner programs and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract.
Sales commissions for the renewal of a contract are not considered commensurate with the sales commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial contract given a substantive difference in commission rates in proportion to their respective contract values. Sales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of four years, determined by taking into consideration the estimated customer life and the technological life of the Company’s software and other factors, while sales commissions for renewals are amortized over the contractual term of the renewals. Amortization of sales commissions are consistent with the pattern of revenue recognition of each performance obligation and are included primarily in sales and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company expenses costs to obtain a contract with a customer as incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less.
The Company periodically reviews these deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit. There were 
no
 impairment losses recorded during the periods presented.

79

Table of Contents

Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
The estimated useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment are as follows:

Computer and software

3 years

Furniture and office equipment

3
 - 
7 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of remaining lease term or estimated useful life

Capitalized Software Costs
Software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred until the establishment of technological feasibility, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers and amortized over the estimated life of the product. Technological feasibility is established when all planning, designing, coding and testing necessary to meet the product’s design specifications have been completed. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The amount of qualifying costs for capitalization incurred was immaterial for the periods presented because the general release process for most of the Company’s products is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility.
Costs related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company’s internal requirements, with no substantive plans to market such software at the time of development are capitalized. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the post implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The amount of qualifying costs for capitalization incurred was immaterial for the periods presented.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company currently does not have any finance leases.
Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company combines its lease payments and fixed payments for non-lease components and account for them together as a single lease component. Operating lease ROU assets also include any prepaid lease payments. Certain lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for the consumer price index (“CPI”). The ROU and lease liability were calculated using the initial CPI and will not be subsequently adjusted. Payments for variable lease costs are expensed as incurred and not included in the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. For short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less, operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are not recognized and the Company records lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Many of the Company’s lease agreements provide one or more options to renew. When determining lease terms, the Company uses the non-cancellable period of the leases and do not assume renewals unless it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Business and Asset Acquisitions
When the Company acquires a business, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed

80

Table of Contents

may be recorded, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company accounts for a transaction as an asset acquisition when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, or otherwise does not meet the definition of a business. Asset acquisition-related costs are capitalized as part of the asset or assets acquired.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. The Company has determined that it has one operating segment and one reporting unit. Goodwill impairment is recognized when the quantitative assessment results in the carrying value exceeding the fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value. There were 
no
 impairment charges to goodwill during the periods presented.
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the respective asset. Each period the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful lives of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
The estimated useful lives of the Company’s intangible assets are as follows:

Developed technology

3
 - 
6 years

Customer relationships

1
 - 
6 years

Other intangible assets

3
 years

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Such events and changes may include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in asset use, significant negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company’s business strategy. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. There were 
no
 impairment charges to long-lived assets during the periods presented.
Deferred Revenue
Revenue is deferred when the Company invoices in advance of performance under a contract. The current portion of the deferred revenue balance is recognized as revenue during the 12-month period after the balance sheet date. The noncurrent portion of the deferred revenue balance is recognized as revenue following the 12-month period after the balance sheet date.
Revenue Recognition
The Company’s revenues are comprised of revenue from self-managed subscriptions and SaaS subscriptions. Subscriptions to the Company’s self-managed software include license, support, and upgrades and updates on a when-and-if-available basis. The Company’s SaaS subscriptions provide access to the Company’s latest managed version of its product hosted in a public cloud. Self-managed subscriptions and SaaS subscriptions are both offered on an annual and multi-year basis, with the exception of certain SaaS subscriptions, which are also offered on a monthly basis. The Company’s annual and multi-year self-managed subscriptions are typically invoiced and collected at the beginning of the contract term or in annual installments. The SaaS subscriptions contain minimum usage commitments and rates for any usage in excess of these commitments. The minimum usage commitments of those SaaS subscriptions are typically billed upfront and any excess usage for each commitment period are typically billed in arrears.

Table of Contents

Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services are delivered. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for these goods or services. To achieve the core principle of this standard, the Company applied the following five steps:
1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer
The Company determines that it has a contract with a customer when each party’s rights regarding the products or services to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the Company has determined the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, the Company evaluates whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation.
2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the products and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the products or services either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the products and services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.
For self-managed subscriptions, the Company’s performance obligations include license for proprietary features of software, support, and upgrades and updates to the software on a when-and-if-available basis. The license provides standalone functionality to the customer and is therefore deemed a distinct performance obligation. Performance obligations related to support as well as upgrades and updates to the software on a when-and-if-available basis generally have a consistent continuous pattern of transfer to a customer during the contract period.
For SaaS subscriptions, the Company provides access to its cloud-hosted software, without providing the customer with the right to take possession of its software, which the Company considers to be a single performance obligation.
3. Determination of the transaction price
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring products or delivery of services to the customer. For SaaS subscriptions, usage-based fees in excess of the minimum usage commitment constitute variable consideration and are included in the transaction price. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement to pay within 30 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company has determined its contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of the Company’s invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing its products and services, not to receive financing from its customers or to provide customers with financing. The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient such that it does not evaluate payment terms of one year or less for the existence of a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (for example, sales tax and other indirect taxes). The Company does not offer right of refund in its contracts.
4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) for each performance obligation. The Company uses judgment in determining the SSP for its products and services. The Company typically assesses the SSP for its products and services on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. To determine SSP, the Company maximizes the use of observable standalone sales and observable data, where available. In instances where performance obligations do not have observable standalone sales, the Company utilizes available information that may include market conditions, pricing strategies, the economic life of the software, and other observable inputs or uses the expected cost-plus margin approach to estimate the price the Company would charge if the products and services were sold separately. For SaaS subscriptions, the Company allocates the variable consideration to the respective commitment period since commitments are consistent throughout the contract term.

5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied
Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised product or delivery of service to the customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. For self-managed subscriptions, the revenue related to the license for proprietary features is recognized upfront, when the license is delivered. This revenue is presented in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations as license–self-managed. The revenue related to support, and upgrades and updates, are recognized ratably over the contract period as the services have a consistent continuous pattern of transfer to a customer during the contract period and is included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations as subscription–self-managed and SaaS. For SaaS subscriptions, revenue is recognized ratably over the commitment period as the services have a consistent continuous pattern of transfer to a customer during the commitment period and is included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations as subscription–self-managed and SaaS.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue primarily consists of expenses related to providing support to the Company’s customers, cloud-related costs, such as hosting and managing costs, the amortization of acquired intangible assets, and allocated overhead. Overhead is allocated to cost of revenue based on applicable headcount.
Research and Development
Research and development costs include personnel-related expenses associated with the Company’s engineering personnel responsible for the design, development and testing of its products, cost of development environments and tools, and allocated overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and include direct marketing, events, public relations, sales collateral materials and partner programs. Advertising costs amount
ed to $
10.5
 million, $
10.6
 mil
lion, and $
8.6
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation related to share options and share purchase rights granted under the Company’s employee share purchase plan is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of awards, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares, the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of the Company’s ordinary shares, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of ordinary shares. The Company measures the grant date fair value of its restricted share units (“RSU”) based on the closing market price of the ordinary share on the date of grant. For share-based awards with only service-based vesting conditions, the compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For performance-based RSUs with market conditions, the Company uses Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value and recognizes expense using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur instead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited.
Interest and Other Income, Net

Interest and other income, net primarily consists of income earned on cash equivalents and short-term investments and foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest income was $
25.9
 million, $
22.1
 million, and $
5.9
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
, respectively. Foreign exchange gains (losses) were not material for all periods presented.
Income Taxes
The Company is subject to income taxes in Israel, the U.S., and other foreign jurisdictions. These foreign jurisdictions may have different statutory rates than in Israel. Income taxes are accounted in accordance with ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
 (“ASC 740”). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit

83

Table of Contents

carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates is accounted for in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
The Company recognizes income tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it believes that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such uncertain tax positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon the ultimate settlement. Although the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), it can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. The Company makes adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.
Net Loss Per Share
The Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive ordinary share equivalents outstanding for the period, including share options and restricted share units.

The replacement restricted share units (“RSU”) had a total fair value of $
8.9
 million, of which $
0.4
 million attributable to pre-acquisition service was part of the purchase consideration. The remaining $
8.5
 million is recognized as share-based compensation expense over the vesting period of approximately 
4
 years.
The acquisition also included a holdback arrangement with certain employees of Qwak, totaling $
17.0
 million in cash and 
754,360
 of the Company’s ordinary shares with a fair value of $
26.8
 million. The consideration will vest in 
three
 equal annual installments on the anniversary of the acquisition date. In addition, the Company agreed to pay retention bonuses of approximately $
2.2
 million to Qwak continuing employees over 
2 years
 from the acquisition date. Both the vesting and payout of the holdback and the retention bonuses are subject to continued employment, and as a result, they are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service periods.
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, subject to subsequent adjustments as the Company may obtain additional information during the measurement period:

Grants from Israeli Innovation Authority
The Company has received in the past grants from the Israeli Innovation Authority (“IIA”) and repaid them in full. Still, as any grant recipient, the Company is subject to the provisions of the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Research, Development and Technological Innovation in the Industry and the regulations and guidelines thereunder (the “Innovation Law”). Pursuant to the Innovation Law, there are restrictions related to transferring intellectual property outside of Israel. Such transfer requires the approval from the IIA. The approval may be subject to a maximum additional payment amount of approximately $
6.0
 million. In the past, the Company received an approval from the IIA to perform a limited development of IIA funded know-how outside of Israel
, subject to the terms specified in the IIA approval, including that all of its core R&D activities will remain in Israel.
Legal Proceedings
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may be subject from time to time to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, or claims. The Company investigates these claims as they arise. Although claims are inherently unpredictable, the Company is currently not aware of any matters that, if determined adversely to the Company, would individually or taken together, have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

12.  Shareholders’ Equity and Equity Incentive Plans
Preferred and Ordinary Shares

 ordinary shares, each with a par value of NIS 
0.01
. All ordinary shares will have identical voting and other rights in all respects. The Company’s AoA does not require shareholder approval of a dividend distribution and provides that dividend distributions may be determined by the Company’s board of directors. To date,

Equity Incentive Plans
In September 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Share Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”), which replaced the 2011 Israeli Share Option Plan (“2011 Plan”). The Company ceased granting awards under the 2011 Plan. The equity awards outstanding under the 2011 Plan continue to be governed by the 2011 Plan. These awards generally vest over 
five years
 and expire 
10 years
 after the date of grant.
The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of share options, ordinary shares, restricted shares, restricted share units and other share-based awards. The maximum number of ordinary shares available for issuance under the 2020 Plan is equal to the sum of (i) 
9,100,000
 ordinary shares plus, (ii) the number of ordinary shares remaining available for issuance under the 2011 Plan as of the date it was replaced, and (iii) the number of ordinary shares that become available under the 2011 Plan as a result of expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or settlement in cash, with the maximum number of shares to be added to the 2020 Plan pursuant to the 2011 Plan equal to 
15,309,367
 shares. In addition, the number of shares available for issuance under the Company’s 2020 Plan also includes an annual increase on January 1 of each year beginning on January 1, 2021 and ending on and including January 1, 2030, in an amount equal to the least of (i) 
9,100,000
 ordinary shares, (ii) five percent (
5
%) of the total number of ordinary shares outstanding as of the last day of the immediately preceding calendar year on a fully diluted basis, or (iii) such number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors. The contractual term for each award granted under the 2020 Plan will be 
10 years
. 
Effective January 1, 2024
, the number of ordinary shares authorized for issuance under the 2020 Plan automatically increased by 
6,070,667
 shares.

Ordinary taxable income in Israel is subject to a corporate tax rate of 
23
%.

The Company applies various benefits allotted to it under the revised Investment Law as per Amendment 73, which includes a number of changes to the Investment Law regimes through regulations that have come into effect from January 1, 2017. Applicable benefits under the new regime include:
•
Introduction of a benefit regime for “Preferred Technology Enterprises” (“PTE”), granting a 
12
% tax rate in central Israel on income deriving from Benefited Intangible Assets, subject to a number of conditions being fulfilled, including a minimal amount or ratio of annual R&D expenditure and R&D employees, as well as having at least 
25
% of annual income derived from exports to large markets.
•
A 
12
% capital gains tax rate on the sale of a preferred intangible asset to a foreign affiliated enterprise, provided that the asset was initially purchased from a foreign resident at an amount of NIS 
200
 million or more.
•
A withholding tax rate of 
20
% for dividends paid from PTE income (with an exemption from such withholding tax applying to dividends paid to an Israeli com
pany) may be reduced to 
4
% on dividends paid to a foreign resident company, subject to certain conditions regarding percentage of foreign ownership of the distributing entity.
The Company adopted the PTE status since 2017 and believes it is eligible for its tax benefits.
The Company’s subsidiaries are separately taxed under the domestic tax laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of each entity.

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has established a valuation allowance to offset certain deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from its net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
 was an increase of $
5.8
 million, $
8.9
 million and $
10.1
 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $
4.4
 million in Israel attributable to the release of valuation allowance as a result of recognizing deferred tax liabilities associated with the Qwak acquisition.
As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had $
168.2
 million in net operating loss carryforwards in Israel, which can be carried forward indefinitely.
As of December 31, 2024
, the U.S. subsidiary had state net operating loss carryforwards of $
64.4
 million available to offset future taxable income, which will expire between 2034 and 2043, if not utilized. The U.S. subsidiary had an immaterial federal net operating loss carryforward as of 
December 31, 2024.
As of December 31, 2024
, certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company had undistributed earnings of $
9.1
 million, which were designated as indefinitely reinvested. If these earnings were repatriated to Israel, it would
 be subject to income taxes and to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding ta
xes. The Company has estimated the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings to be approximately $
0.8
 million.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

As of December 31, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was
 $
6.1
 million, of 
which, $
4.1
 milli
on, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s effective tax rate.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were immaterial.
The Company has net operating losses from prior tax periods which may be subjected to examination in future periods. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s tax years after 2019 are open to examination in Israel. Its U.S. subsidiary’s tax filings for tax years after 2020 are open to examinations by U.S. federal tax authorities and tax years after 2021 are open to examinations by U.S. state tax authorities. In addition, the U.S. federal tax returns were settled through 2018 except for any adjustments which might be made as a result of the carryback of net operating losses. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s subsidiary in France is under examination by the local tax authorities for the years from 2021 through 2023. The Company does not expect the results of the examination to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The C
ompany currently does not expect uncertain tax positions to change significantly over the next 12 months, except in the case of settlements with tax authorities, the likelihood and timing of which is difficult to estimate.

15.  Employee Benefit Plans
The Company has a defined-contribution plan in the U.S. intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “401(k) Plan”). The 401(k) Plan covers substantially all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. Until February 29, 2024, the Company matched 
50
% of participating employee contributions to the plan up to 
6
% of the employee’s eligible compensation. Effective March 1, 2024, the matching contribution increased to 
8
%. During the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023, and 2022
, the Company recorded $
2.1
 million, $
1.6
 million and $
1.4
 million, respectively, of expenses related to the 401(k) plan.
Israeli Severance Pay

Pursuant to Israel’s Severance Pay Law, Israeli employees are entitled to severance pay equal to one month’s salary for each year of employment, or a portion thereof. The Company has elected to include its employees in Israel under Section 14 of the Severance Pay Law, under which these employees are entitled only to monthly deposits made in their name with insurance companies, at a rate of 
8.33
% of their monthly salary. These payments release the Company from any future obligation under the Israeli Severance Pay Law to make severance payments in respect of those employees; therefore, any liability for severance pay due to these employees, and the deposits under Section 14 are not recorded as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023, and 2022
, the Company recorded $
7.6
 million, $
6.2
 million, and $
5.5
 million, respectively, in severance expenses related to these employees.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and 
Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were, in design and operation, effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting,” as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria established in
 Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based on the results of its evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Kost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer, an independent registered public accounting firm and a m
ember of Ernst & Young Global
, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Management has excluded Qwak AI Ltd., acquired on July 9, 2024, from its our evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Qwak AI Ltd. constituted less than 1% of total assets as of December 31, 2024, excluding intangible assets and goodwill, and less than 1% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
