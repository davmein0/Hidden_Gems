Overview

JFrog provides a hybrid, universal, end-to-end software supply chain platform for delivering trusted, secure software updates from code to production. Our goal is to function as the single source of truth for an organization’s software footprint, bridging digital gaps between developers, security teams, machine learning engineers, data scientists, and other business units to empower a world of always-on, always-current software which we refer to as “Liquid Software.”

Today, DevOps, DevSecOps, and MLOps teams have a universal goal within organizations: ship secure, intelligent software more efficiently and confidently. As a pioneer in the DevOps movement, JFrog recognizes the challenges that companies face as they attempt to converge traditional software development practices, operational teams, security (or DevSecOps), artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning (or MLOps) and more. This rapidly-evolving demand requires a new generation of tooling that encompasses the complete software supply chain; a platform that serves many functions in an organization.

We expect that our all-inclusive platform serving “EveryOps” will endure: as the volume of software increases - created both by developers and by emerging generative AI technologies - companies will increasingly require scalable, efficient tools to help manage workflows, processes, policies, application security and all software components. JFrog serves demanding enterprises, leading companies to increasingly appoint JFrog as their system of record across their software development organizations.

Software and the Business Environment

Software’s role has changed from a functional tool to a cornerstone of nearly every company, dictating that the continuous development and release of software is now a mission-critical operation. Beyond providing competitive advantage for companies, the safety and security of people’s data is now often software-dependent.

To meet this need, updating a feature of a software application, rather than releasing a new version of the entire application, ensures that current software is brought to market faster, allowing organizations to be more responsive to their customers’ needs, security concerns and corporate welfare.

The proliferation of open source software, and availability of newer and more efficient software development technologies such as AI technologies, enable organizations to produce software at an increasing rate. However, with speed can come software supply chain complexity through disparate services, adoption of containers, and deployment across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Organizations’ existing approaches can create silos and bottlenecks around critical steps, such as planning, curating, building, testing, securing, and delivering intelligent software. The merging of new technologies with legacy approaches has placed significant strain on traditional software workflows, which are even further complicated by the introduction of AI components.

The DevOps, DevSecOps, and MLOps Workflows

DevOps is a maturing discipline that integrates software development and operations, shortening, automating, and improving the software build and release workflow. DevOps is a combination of technologies, methodologies, and culture that powers a continuous, fast, and secure software release cycle.

The DevSecOps workflow spans the DevOps workflow, but with the addition of security capabilities, including the planning, curating, coding, building, securing, and testing of software components by developers, to the secure releasing, deploying, operating, and monitoring of that software by operators. Sometimes dubbed “shifting left,” DevSecOps integrates security practices across the DevOps workflow for early detection of issues and ongoing software security throughout the software’s lifecycle. JFrog provides the common ground for software developers, security teams, and IT operators, making it integral to the DevOps and DevSecOps workflows to create trusted software releases.

Similar to the DevOps workflow, the MLOps workflow combines the work of data science and machine learning engineering teams who build, train, and deploy machine learning models with operational motions that bring these models and AI-empowering technologies into production as part of an application.

The convergence of DevOps, DevSecOps, and MLOps solutions into a single platform allows JFrog to address multiple processes to enable more rapid, intelligent application delivery across a business.

Code Versus Software Packages

Modern society heavily relies on software, and most individuals understand that software comes from code generated by software developers. But software, in code form, doesn’t equate to an application. Code is built (i.e., transformed) into binary files (or “software packages”) that allow it to run alongside other components as a complete application for consumers as it runs on a server or device. The vast majority of applications today are built using only a small percentage of original source code written by developers, with an estimated >80% of an application’s binaries coming from open source, existing software. JFrog’s unified platform (“JFrog Platform”) is designed to universally manage and deploy all types of software packages within an organization, making it the system of record for an organization’s software, whether bespoke or consumed from a third party.

Increasingly, the need to manage software components is being heavily influenced by the emerging needs to manage machine learning models (and large language models) and their dependencies. The increasingly large volumes and complexity of packages within an organization’s software supply chain requires a new, systematic, and automated approach to trusted management of packages. Tracking and managing software at the package level enables organizations to make incremental updates to software and deliver trusted software bill of materials alongside their software releases. Universal package management allows software releases to be continuous, and capable of handling the volume, variety, security, and velocity of trusted software required today.

Our Platform

The JFrog Platform connects all of the software release processes involved in building and releasing software, enabling trust by offering a single source of truth for all software release inputs and outputs. We empower our customers to shorten their software and AI technology release cycles and enable the continuous flow of current, secure, up-to-date software from any source to any distributed edge. Our platform is designed to be agnostic to the programming languages, source code repositories, and development technologies that our customers use, and the type of production environments to which they deploy.

The JFrog Platform allows customers to compile software from source code repositories, curate the importation of external software packages, manage the dependencies among components within software packages, keep these packages under a single universal repository, manage and automate the usage of open source libraries and packages, scan for vulnerabilities through various stages and contexts, distribute to endpoints, and deploy securely to production, all through a single user access point. This complete process is often referred to as management and securing of the “software supply chain.”

Since JFrog’s inception with the creation of the software package management category (JFrog Artifactory), we have consistently innovated and added new solutions to expand the capabilities of our platform.

Diversified vendors.
 Some diversified technology companies, such as IBM, Inc. (including Red Hat), Pivotal Software, and Broadcom’s VMware may have offerings that compete with certain JFrog products.

Additionally, we may compete with start-up and open source technologies across the categories described above. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, and other resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, broader distribution networks, diverse product and services offerings, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. They may be able to leverage these resources to gain business in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our offerings. Furthermore, we expect that our industry will continue to attract new investments, including smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new offerings. We may also expand into new technology or geographical markets and encounter additional competitors in such markets.

Research and Development

Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of new technologies, featu
res, and integrations of our platform, as well as the continued improvement and iteration of our existing products. Our most significant investments in research and development are to drive core technology innovation and bring new products to market. Research and development employees are located primarily in our Israel and India offices.

Our research and development team consists of our architects, software engineers, security experts, DevOps engineers, AI and machine learning experts, product management, quali
ty assurance, and data collection teams. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development capabilities to extend our platform and products.

Intellectual Property

Our success depends in 
part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, employment agreements, license agreements, invention assignment agreements, trademarks, and patents to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how, and brand.

As of December 31, 2024, we hold a number of active patents and have filed patent applications both in the U.S. and in other countries. With any of our patent applications, it is possible that they could result in the issuance of a patent or the examination process could require us to narrow our claims. Any of our patents issued in the future may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. In addition, we have international operations and intend to continue to expand these operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.

Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.

We control access to, and use of, our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, incl
uding contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright and trade secret laws. We require our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and partners. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.

Government Regulations

Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws, rules and regulations. For example, we are subject to numerous laws, directives, and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security and the collection, storing, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other data. In addition, in some cases, our software is subject to export control laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and our activities may be subject to certain trade and economic sanctions. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Employees and Human Capital

Our Board of Directors and its committees share oversight of our human capital management strategy. We annually conduct talent reviews and succession planning and the Board of Directors receives updates from senior management regarding succession planning, management talent assessment, and employee attrition. The Compensation Committee of the Board oversees our approach to human capital and provides oversight of our overall compensation philosophy, policies, and programs, ensuring their respective alignment with our human capital strategy. The Audit Committee of the Board reviews our ethics and compliance programs for human capital and workplace-related issues with management. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has oversight of our approach to diversity as part of its broader oversight of our sustainability strategy and initiatives.

As of December 31, 2024, we had a total of approximately 1,600 employees globally, including approximately 800 employees located in Israel and approximately 400 employees in the United States. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or, except for our employees in France and Spain, covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Our Culture

Our core values are reflected in our CODEX, which was created by our employees. We emphasize these values through formal and informal training. Each year we conduct a CODEX employee engagement survey asking for employee feedback to better understand our strengths and weaknesses and assess the alignment of the CODEX with the needs of our company. Based on the results of our annual employee surveys, we believe the CODEX will continue to support our growth and success moving forward. Our CODEX values are:

•
Integrity.
 We subscribe to presenting the truth, honestly, even if it’s subjective, in order to achieve mutual well-being and transparency. We might make mistakes, but we always play fair.

Recruiting, Training and Development

Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees and consultants. We attract new employees by advertising on our JFrog careers website and on LinkedIn, as well as leveraging our employee referral program. In order to meet our professional development objectives, we have implemented several formal and informal cross-company training programs to train new managers and employees with the skills to embark on a successful career at JFrog. In addition to annual performance reviews and merit-based compensation, we also encourage employees and their managers to maintain an open dialogue on progress throughout the year. Moreover, we focus on providing each employee an individualized career path and professional development opportunities.

Everyone Counts, Everyone Matters

We recognize and view equality as key to our success. We strive to foster a culture where all of our employees feel they are respected and treated equally, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, color, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, veteran status, pregnancy, HIV/AIDS status, cultural background, religious belief, genetic information status, or domestic violence status. We emphasize this principle in our CODEX value “
Everyone Counts Everyone Matters
” and aim

to provide our employees a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment.

We continue to support equal opportunity in hiring and mandatory non-discrimination and anti-harassment training for all employees. For example, our workforce is diverse both in ethnicity and gender, including and up to the highest level of management, where three of our 10-member board and three of our 10-member executive management team are women.

Compensation and Benefits

Our compensation policy is designed to attract, retain and reward personnel. In addition to competitive base salaries and other cash compensation, we offer equity incentive plans that align the interest of our employees with our shareholders by motivating individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our business objectives, thereby driving the success of our company and increasing shareholder value.

Workforce Health and Safety

In addition to traditional employee benefits, we have implemented a number of initiatives to support the well-being, safety and health of our employees. We provide comprehensive health insurance that includes medical, dental, vision, and prescription drug coverage, along with many other benefits such as an Employee Assistance Program and wellness and fitness membership
