Market and shareholder information

Our ordinary shares are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ALKS.” There were 87 shareholders of record of our ordinary shares on February 7, 2025.

Dividends

No dividends have been paid on our ordinary shares to date, and we do not expect to pay cash dividends thereon in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will generally retain a significant portion of our earnings to support our operations and our proprietary drug development programs. Any future determination as to the payment of dividends, if at all, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors and management deem relevant.

Repurchase of equity securities

In February 2024, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase ordinary shares of the Company in an aggregate amount of up to $400.0 million (exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases) from time to time on the open market (the “Repurchase Program”). The timing and amount of any share repurchases under the Repurchase Program will be based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to ongoing assessments of our capital needs, alternative investment opportunities, the market price of our ordinary shares and general market conditions. The Repurchase Program has no set expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased approximately 7.9 million of our ordinary shares under the Repurchase Program at an average price of $25.33, resulting in a total cost, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchase, of $200.0 million. All ordinary shares repurchased were returned to treasury. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining amount authorized under the Repurchase Program was $200.0 million, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other related expenses.

The following table sets forth our share repurchase activity for the three months ended December 31, 2024:

The specific timing and amounts of repurchases under the Repurchase Program will depend on a variety of factors, including but not limited to ongoing assessments of our needs, alternative investment opportunities, the market price of our ordinary shares and general market conditions. The Repurchase Program has no set expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Irish taxes applicable to U.S. holders

The following is a general summary of the main Irish tax considerations applicable to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares by U.S. holders. It is based on existing Irish law and practices in effect on January 6, 2025, and on discussions and correspondence with the Irish Revenue Commissioners. Legislative, administrative or judicial changes may modify the tax consequences described below.

53

The statements do not constitute tax advice and are intended only as a general guide. Furthermore, this information applies only to our ordinary shares held as capital assets and does not apply to all categories of shareholders, such as dealers in securities, trustees, insurance companies, collective investment schemes and shareholders who acquire, or who are deemed to acquire, their ordinary shares by virtue of an office or employment. The statements are in reference to individuals who are considered non-resident and non-ordinarily resident of Ireland for tax purposes. This summary is not exhaustive and shareholders should consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences in Ireland, or other relevant jurisdictions where we operate, including the acquisition, ownership and disposition of ordinary shares.

Withholding tax on dividends

While we have no current plans to pay dividends, dividends on our ordinary shares would generally be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax (“DWT”) at 25%, unless an exemption applies. Dividends on our ordinary shares that are owned by residents of the U.S. and held beneficially through the Depositary Trust Company (“DTC”) will not be subject to DWT provided that the address of the beneficial owner of the ordinary shares in the records of the broker is in the U.S.

Dividends on our ordinary shares that are owned by residents of the U.S. and held directly (outside of DTC) will not be subject to DWT provided that the shareholder that is the beneficial owner of such ordinary shares has completed the appropriate Irish DWT form and this form remains valid. Such shareholders must provide the appropriate Irish DWT form to our transfer agent at least seven business days before the record date for the first dividend payment to which they are entitled.

If any shareholder who is resident in the U.S. receives a dividend subject to DWT, they should generally be able to make an application for a refund from the Irish Revenue Commissioners on the prescribed form.

Income tax on dividends

Irish income tax, if any, may arise in respect of dividends paid by us. However, a shareholder who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and who is entitled to an exemption from DWT, generally has no liability for Irish income tax or to the universal social charge on a dividend from us, unless they holds their ordinary shares through a branch or agency in Ireland which carries out a trade on their behalf.

Irish tax on capital gains

A shareholder who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and does not hold our ordinary shares in connection with a trade or business carried on by such shareholder in Ireland through a branch or agency, should not be within the scope of the charge to Irish tax on capital gains on a disposal of our ordinary shares. A shareholder who is an individual and who is temporarily not resident in Ireland may, under Irish anti-avoidance legislation, still be liable for Irish tax on capital gains on any chargeable gain realized upon the disposal of our ordinary shares during the period in which such individual is a non-resident.

Capital acquisitions tax

Irish capital acquisitions tax (“CAT”) is comprised principally of gift tax and inheritance tax. CAT could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties. This is because our ordinary shares are regarded as property situated in Ireland as our share register must be held in Ireland. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT.

CAT is levied at a rate of 33% above certain tax-free thresholds. The appropriate tax-free threshold is dependent upon (i) the relationship between the donor and the recipient, and (ii) the aggregation of the values of previous gifts and inheritances received by the recipient from persons within the same category of relationship for CAT purposes. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Our shareholders should consult their own tax advisers as to whether CAT is creditable or deductible in computing any domestic tax liabilities.

Stamp duty

Irish stamp duty, if any, may become payable in respect of ordinary share transfers. However, a transfer of our ordinary shares effected by means of book-entry interests in DTC will not be subject to Irish stamp duty.  A transfer of our ordinary shares (i) by a seller who holds ordinary shares outside of DTC to any buyer, or (ii) by a seller who holds the ordinary shares through DTC to a buyer who holds the acquired ordinary shares outside of DTC, may be subject to Irish stamp duty, which is currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the ordinary shares acquired, if greater. The person accountable for payment of stamp duty is the buyer or, in the case of a transfer by way of a gift or for less than market value, all parties to the transfer.

A shareholder who holds ordinary shares outside of DTC may transfer those ordinary shares into DTC without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the related book-entry interest in those ordinary shares recorded in the systems of DTC, and in exactly the same proportions, as a result of the transfer and at the time of the transfer into DTC there is no sale of those book-entry interests to a third party being contemplated by the shareholder. Similarly, a shareholder who

54

holds ordinary shares through DTC may transfer those ordinary shares out of DTC without giving rise to Irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the ordinary shares, and in exactly the same proportions, as a result of the transfer, and at the time of the transfer out of DTC there is no sale of those ordinary shares to a third party being contemplated by the shareholder.

In order for the share registrar to be satisfied as to the application of this Irish stamp duty treatment where relevant, the shareholder must confirm to us that the shareholder would be the beneficial owner of the related book-entry interest in those ordinary shares recorded in the systems of DTC, and in exactly the same proportions or vice-versa, as a result of the transfer and there is no agreement for the sale of the related book-entry interest or the ordinary shares or an interest in the ordinary shares, as the case may be, by the shareholder to a third party being contemplated.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” on page 
3
 of this Annual Report. Factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report. A detailed discussion of our 2022 financial condition and results of operations, and of 2023 year-over-year changes as compared to 2022, can be found in “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.

Overview

We have a portfolio of proprietary products that we manufacture, market and sell in the U.S.—VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI. We also earn manufacturing and/or royalty revenues on net sales of products commercialized by our licensees, the most significant of which in 2024 were the long-acting INVEGA products and VUMERITY. We expect VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO, LYBALVI and VUMERITY to generate significant revenues for us in the near- and medium-term as we believe these products are singular or competitively advantaged products in their classes.

In 2024, our net income from continuing operations was $372.1 million, as compared to $519.2 million in 2023. The decrease in net income from continuing operations was primarily due to two significant one-time events in 2023, which were the receipt in June 2023 of back royalties and interest in respect of 2022 U.S. sales of the long-acting INVEGA products, following the successful outcome of the arbitration proceedings related to such products, and the partial release of our valuation allowance maintained against certain Irish deferred tax assets. These events were partially offset by an increase in our product sales, net and a decrease in our operating expenses in 2024. These items are discussed in further detail within the “Results of Operations” section below.

Business Update

In May 2024, we completed the sale of the Athlone Facility to Novo and entered into subcontracting arrangements to continue certain development and manufacturing activities performed at the Athlone Facility, which may continue through the end of 2025.

In November 2023, we completed the separation of our former oncology business into a new, independent, publicly-traded company (the “Separation”), which is more fully described in Note 3, 
Discontinued Operations
, in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report.

Results of Operations

As a result of the Separation, the historical results of our former oncology business have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements through November 15, 2023, the date of the Separation. Prior period results of operations and balance sheet information have been recast to reflect this presentation.

Product Sales, Net

Our product sales, net, consist of sales of VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO, and LYBALVI, primarily to wholesalers, specialty distributors and pharmacies. The following table presents the adjustments deducted from product sales, gross to arrive at product sales, net, for sales of these products during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:

VIVITROL product sales, gross, increased by 10%, which was primarily due to a 7% increase in the number of units sold and a 3.2% increase in the selling price that went into effect in January 2024. ARISTADA and ARISTADA INITIO product sales, gross, increased by 5%, which was primarily due to a 3% increase in the number of units sold and a 3.0% increase in the selling price that went into effect in January 2024. LYBALVI product sales, gross, increased by 52%, which was primarily due to a 45% increase in the number of units sold and increases of 3.8% and 2.0% in the selling price that went into effect in January 2024 and July 2024, respectively.

The decrease in Medicaid rebates as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the increase in sales of LYBALVI, which has lower Medicaid utilization than VIVITROL, ARISTADA and ARISTADA INITIO, and actual Medicaid utilization rates related to VIVITROL being lower than original estimates, due, in part, to $8.7 million in actual credits received in the fourth quarter of 2024 from certain states related to duplicate Medicaid billings.

A number of companies currently market and/or are developing products to treat addiction, including alcohol and opioid dependence, that may compete with, and negatively impact, future sales of VIVITROL. Increased competition may lead to reduced unit sales of VIVITROL and increased pricing pressure. The latest to expire of our patents covering VIVITROL will expire in 2029 in the U.S. Pursuant to the terms of a confidential settlement and license agreement entered into in August 2023 with Teva, we granted Teva a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable limited license under the remaining patent covering VIVITROL to market and sell a generic version of VIVITROL in the U.S. beginning on the First Entry Date, or earlier under certain circumstances. Under the terms of a settlement and license agreement entered into in July 2019 with Amneal, we granted Amneal a non-exclusive license under certain patents covering VIVITROL, including the remaining patent covering VIVITROL in the U.S., to market and sell a generic formulation of VIVITROL in the U.S. beginning on the earlier of the First Entry Date, sometime in 2028 or earlier under certain circumstances.

A number of companies currently market and/or are developing products to treat schizophrenia and/or bipolar I disorder that may compete with and negatively impact future sales of ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI. Increased competition may lead to reduced unit sales of ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI and increased pricing pressure. The latest to expire of our patents covering ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI in the U.S. will expire in 2039, 2039 and 2041, respectively; and, as such, we do not anticipate any generic versions of these products to enter the market in the near term.

Manufacturing and Royalty Revenues

Manufacturing revenue from RISPERDAL CONSTA and VUMERITY are recognized at the point in time that the product has been fully manufactured. Royalties earned on our licensees’ net sales of products using our proprietary technologies are recognized in the period such products are sold by our licensees. The following table compares manufacturing and royalty revenues earned in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:

The decrease in royalty revenues related to the long-acting INVEGA products was primarily due to the receipt in June 2023 of back royalties of $195.4 million, inclusive of $8.1 million in late-payment interest, related to 2022 U.S. sales of the long-acting INVEGA products following the successful outcome of the arbitration proceedings related to such products and the expiration of our royalty on U.S. net sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA in August 2024. Pursuant to the Final Award issued in the arbitration proceedings,

57

we are entitled to royalty revenues from Janssen related to U.S. net sales of INVEGA TRINZA and INVEGA HAFYERA through certain specified dates in 2030. We expect royalty revenues from net sales of the long-acting INVEGA products to decrease further in 2025, as the royalty revenues related to U.S. net sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA comprised a significant portion of the overall royalty revenues for the long-acting INVEGA products.

For additional discussion of our agreements with Janssen related to the long-acting INVEGA products, including the royalty provisions set forth therein and the related arbitration proceedings and outcome, see the section entitled “
Collaborative Arrangements
—
Janssen
” in “Item 1—Business” in this Annual Report.

In addition, each of INVEGA SUSTENNA and INVEGA TRINZA is currently subject to Paragraph IV litigation in response to companies seeking to market generic versions of such product. Increased competition from new products or generic versions of any one or more of the long-acting INVEGA products may lead to reduced unit sales of the long-acting INVEGA products, including those not yet genericized, and increased pricing pressure. For a discussion of legal proceedings related to INVEGA TRINZA, see Note 19, 
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report, and for information about risks relating to these legal proceedings, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, and specifically the section entitled “Uncertainty over IP in the biopharmaceutical industry has been the source of litigation and other legal proceedings, and we or our licensees may face claims against IP rights covering our products and competition from generic drug manufacturers.”

The increase in VUMERITY revenue was due to an $8.3 million increase in royalty revenue, partially offset by a $3.6 million decrease in manufacturing revenue. The increase in royalty revenue was primarily due to an increase in end-market sales of VUMERITY to $628.0 million in 2024, as compared to $576.3 million in 2023. The decrease in manufacturing revenue was primarily due to a reduction in the selling price. The manufacturing fee we earn is based on our cost to produce VUMERITY. As the assets used to manufacture VUMERITY were classified as held for sale and transferred to Novo in connection with the sale of the Athlone Facility, depreciation expense was removed from the manufacturing cost base, which had a negative impact on our manufacturing fee. For a discussion of our agreements with Biogen related to VUMERITY, including the manufacturing and royalty revenue provisions set forth therein, see the section entitled “
Collaborative Arrangements—Biogen
” in “Item 1—Business” in this Annual Report.

The decrease in revenue from RISPERDAL CONSTA was primarily due to a decrease of $13.0 million in manufacturing revenue, which was primarily due to a decrease in the number of batches made available to Janssen. The decrease in royalty revenue was due to expirations of the patents covering RISPERDAL CONSTA, which expired in the U.S. in January 2023 and in the EU in 2021. We expect revenues from RISPERDAL CONSTA to continue to decrease as patents covering RISPERDAL CONSTA continue to expire in markets where end-market net sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA occur. We are aware of potential generic and other competition to RISPERDAL CONSTA that may lead to reduced unit sales and increased pricing pressure. For a discussion of our agreements with Janssen related to RISPERDAL CONSTA, including the manufacturing provisions set forth therein, see the section entitled “
Collaborative Arrangements—Janssen
” in “Item 1—Business” in this Annual Report.

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized $36.6 million and $49.9 million, respectively, in manufacturing and royalty revenue related to FAMPYRA which is included within “Other” in the table above. As of December 31, 2024, our manufacturing obligations related to FAMPYRA concluded. Accordingly, we do not expect to recognize any revenues related to FAMPYRA going forward.

Certain of our manufacturing and royalty revenues are earned in countries outside of the U.S. and are denominated in currencies in which the product is sold. See “Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in this Annual Report for information on currency exchange rate risk related to our revenues and “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this Annual Report, and specifically the section entitled “Currency exchange rates may affect revenues and expenses” for risks related to currency exchange rates.

The decrease in cost of goods manufactured and sold was primarily due to lower cost of goods manufactured for certain legacy products due to a decrease in volumes of such products. This includes RISPERDAL CONSTA as well as products manufactured at the Athlone Facility. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the cost of goods sold for certain of our proprietary products due to increases in the number of units sold as discussed above, and an increase in costs related to VIVITROL out-of-specification batches and subsequent investigation costs.

Research and Development Expenses

For each of our R&D programs, we incur both external and internal expenses. External R&D expenses include fees for clinical and preclinical activities performed by CROs, consulting fees, and costs related to laboratory services, the purchase of drug product materials and third-party manufacturing development activities. Internal R&D expenses include employee-related expenses, occupancy costs, depreciation and general overhead. We track external R&D expenses for each of our development programs; however, internal R&D expenses are not tracked by individual program as they can benefit multiple development programs or our products or technologies in general.

The following table sets forth our external R&D expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 relating to our then-current development programs and our internal R&D expenses, listed by the nature of such expenses:

These amounts are not necessarily predictive of future R&D expenses. In an effort to allocate our spending most effectively, we continually evaluate our products under development based on the performance of such products in preclinical and/or clinical trials, our expectations regarding the likelihood of their regulatory approval and our view of their future potential commercial viability, among other factors.

The increase in expenses related to ALKS 2680 was primarily due to an increase in spend related to the advancement of the development programs for the product, including completion of our phase 1b proof-of-concept studies, initiation of our phase 2 clinical studies, Vibrance-1 and Vibrance-2 and preparatory spend in advance of initiation of our phase 2 study for IH. The increase in expenses related to LYBALVI was primarily due to increased spend on our pediatric studies related to the product, partially offset by decreased spend following the completion of our long-term safety and tolerability studies. The decrease in other external R&D expenses was primarily due to identifying cost-effective resourcing options for clinical programming and outsourced data management services and decreases in spend on activities associated with certain of our research programs. The decrease in employee-related expenses was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits related to a 10% reduction in R&D-related headcount during 2024.

Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and available-for-sale investments. The increase in interest income was due to an increase in our cash and investments and increases in interest rates due to the rising interest rate environment. Interest expense consists of interest incurred on our previously outstanding term loans scheduled to become due in 2026 (the “Former Term Loans”) under our former amended and restated credit agreement (the “Former Credit Agreement”), which we prepaid in full and terminated on December 19, 2024.

The increase in other income (expense), net was primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Athlone Facility of approximately $1.5 million, following the completion of the sale in May 2024.

The income tax provision in 2024 was primarily due to taxes on income earned in Ireland. The income tax benefit in 2023 was primarily attributable to the partial release of the valuation allowance maintained against certain Irish deferred tax assets, partially offset by taxes on income earned in the U.S. and Ireland. Our effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2024 was 16.1%, which exceeds the Irish statutory tax rate of 12.5%, primarily due to non-deductible expenses and income that was taxable at rates higher than the Irish statutory tax rate. The new corporate minimum tax rate of 15.0% did not have a material impact on our business in 2024.

Cumulative unremitted earnings of U.S. subsidiaries totaled approximately $933.5 million as of December 31, 2024. In the event of a repatriation of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be liable for income taxes, subject to adjustment, if any, for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes payable to foreign tax authorities. We estimate that approximately $72.0 million of income taxes would be payable on the repatriation of the unremitted earnings to Ireland.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $393.9 million of Irish NOL carryforwards, $14.1 million of U.S. federal NOL carryforwards, $43.2 million of state NOL carryforwards and $34.0 million of state tax credits which will either expire on various dates through 2039 or can be carried forward indefinitely. These loss and credit carryforwards are available to reduce certain future Irish and foreign taxable income and tax. These loss and credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the appropriate taxing authorities, and may be subject to limitations based upon changes in the ownership of our ordinary shares. Included within these loss and credit carryforwards are $14.1 million of U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and $5.8 million of state NOL

carryforwards, acquired as part of the acquisition of Rodin Therapeutics, Inc. (“Rodin”) in November 2019, each of which are subject to a $0.5 million annual limitation.

Sources and Uses of Cash

We generated $439.1 million and $401.4 million of cash from operating activities during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In December 2024, we prepaid our previously outstanding long-term debt without penalty in the amount of $289.5 million and, during the course of 2024, repurchased approximately $200.0 million of our ordinary shares. We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to finance our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements, including capital expenditures, for at least the twelve months following the date from which our financial statements were issued. Subject to market conditions, interest rates and other factors, we may pursue opportunities to obtain financing in the future, including debt and equity offerings, corporate collaborations, bank borrowings, arrangements relating to assets or other financing methods or structures.

Our investment objectives are, first, to preserve liquidity and conserve capital and, second, to generate investment income. We mitigate credit risk in our cash reserves by maintaining a well-diversified portfolio that limits the amount of investment exposure as to institution, maturity and investment type. Our available-for-sale investments consist primarily of short and long-term U.S. government and agency debt securities and corporate debt securities. Our held-to-maturity investments consist of investments that are held as collateral under certain letters of credit related to certain of our lease agreements.

We classify available-for-sale investments in an unrealized loss position that do not mature within 12 months as long-term investments. We have the intent and ability to hold these investments until recovery, which may be at maturity, and it is more-likely-than-not that we would not be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost.

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources in the next 12 months. In connection with our acquisition of Rodin, we may become obligated to make up to $825.0 million in future milestone payments to the former shareholders of Rodin, $200.0 million of which would be triggered upon achievement of certain specified clinical milestones, $300.0 million of which would be triggered by the achievement of certain regulatory milestones and $325.0 million of which would be triggered upon the attainment of certain sales thresholds. At December 31, 2024, we had not recorded a liability related to these milestone payments as none of the future events that would trigger a milestone payment were considered probable of occurring.

Operating Activities

Cash flows provided by operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income (loss) for non-cash operating items such as depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations.

Cash flows provided by operating activities during 2024 primarily consisted of net income of $367.1 million, adjusted for non-cash items, including share-based compensation of $96.6 million and depreciation and amortization of $28.5 million and deferred income taxes of $40.5 million.

Cash flows provided by operating activities during 2023 primarily consisted of net income of $355.8 million, adjusted for non-cash items, including share-based compensation of $100.9 million and depreciation and amortization of $74.9 million, partially offset by changes in working capital of $36.7 million and deferred income taxes of $99.9 million. During 2023, net income included receipt of $195.4 million from Janssen, inclusive of $8.1 million in late-payment interest, related to 2022 U.S. net sales of the long-acting INVEGA products following the successful outcome of the arbitration proceedings in respect of such products.

Investing Activities

Cash flows used in investing activities during 2024 primarily consisted of $176.2 million in net purchases of investments and the purchase of $33.5 million of property, plant and equipment. These outflows were offset by proceeds from the sale of the Athlone Facility and related business of $97.9 million. Cash flows provided by investing activities during 2023 primarily consisted of $101.1 million in net sales of investments and offset by the purchase of $48.0 million of property, plant and equipment.

We expect to spend approximately $45.0 million to $50.0 million during the year ending December 31, 2025 for capital expenditures. We continue to evaluate our manufacturing capacity based on expectations of demand for the products that we manufacture and will continue to record such amounts within construction in progress until such time as the underlying assets are placed into service, or we determine we have sufficient existing capacity and the assets are no longer required, at which time we would recognize an impairment charge. We continue to periodically evaluate whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.

Financing Activities

Cash flows used in financing activities during 2024 primarily related to the prepayment of our previously outstanding long-term debt in the full amount of $289.5 million, payment for the repurchase of our ordinary shares and related expenses in the amount of $200.3 million, and $29.6 million of employee taxes paid related to net share settlements of equity awards, partially offset by $27.6 million of cash that we received upon exercises of employee stock options. Cash flows used in financing activities during 2023 primarily related to $275.0 million in cash distributed to Mural Oncology plc in connection with the Separation and $28.5 million of employee taxes paid related to net share settlements of equity awards, partially offset by $16.8 million of cash that we received upon exercises of employee stock options.

Debt

In December 2024, we prepaid in full all Former Term Loans under the Former Credit Agreement for a total of $289.5 million. The Company did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the Former Credit Agreement (other than customary breakage costs). All liens on the collateral securing the obligations under the Former Credit Agreement were released in connection with the termination. Such prepayment was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. See Note 12, 
Long-Term Debt
, in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report for additional discussion related to our Former Term Loans.

62

Discontinued Operations

Net loss from discontinued operations consists of the results of our former oncology business and is reported as a separate component of income. For additional information, see Note 3, 
Discontinued Operations
, in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review these accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
, of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

We recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue following the five-step model prescribed under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“Topic 606”): (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligations.

Product Sales, Net

Our product sales, net consist of sales in the U.S. of VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI, primarily to wholesalers, specialty distributors and pharmacies. Product sales, net are recognized when the customer obtains control of the product, which is when the product has been received by the customer.

Revenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with our customers, healthcare providers or payers. Our process for estimating reserves established for these variable consideration components does not differ materially from historical practices. The transaction price, which includes variable consideration reflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject to constraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of the cumulative revenues recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment. The following are our significant categories of sales discounts and allowances:

•
Medicaid Rebates
—we record accruals for rebates to U.S. states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program as a reduction of sales when the product is shipped into the distribution channel using the expected value. We rebate individual U.S. states for all eligible units purchased under the Medicaid program based on a rebate per unit calculation, which is based on our average manufacturer prices. We estimate expected unit sales to individuals covered by Medicaid and rebates per unit under the Medicaid program and adjust our rebate accrual based on actual unit sales and rebates per unit and changes in trends in Medicaid utilization. In 2024, actual Medicaid utilization rates related to VIVITROL were lower than original estimates, due, in part, to $8.7 million in actual credits received in the fourth quarter of 2024 from certain states related to duplicate Medicaid billings. Medicaid rebates for our other products have not differed materially from our estimates; 

•
Chargebacks
—discounts that occur when contracted indirect customers purchase directly from wholesalers and specialty distributors. Contracted customers generally purchase a product at its contracted price. The wholesaler or specialty distributor, in turn, then generally charges back to us the difference between the wholesale acquisition cost and the contracted price paid to the wholesaler or specialty distributor by the customer. The allowance for chargebacks is made using the expected value and is based on actual and expected utilization of these programs. Chargebacks could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future participation in these programs. To date, actual chargebacks have not differed materially from our estimates;

63

•
Product Discounts
—cash consideration, including sales incentives, given by us under agreements with a number of wholesaler, distributor, pharmacy, and treatment provider customers that provide them with a discount on the purchase price of products. The reserve is made using the expected value and to date, actual product discounts have not differed materially from our estimates; 

•
Product Returns
—we record an estimate for product returns at the time our customers take control of our product. We estimate this liability using the expected returns of product sold based on our historical return levels and specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates. Return amounts are recorded as a reduction of sales. Once product is returned, it is destroyed. Actual product returns have not differed materially from our estimates; and

•
Medicare Part D
—we record accruals for Medicare Part D liabilities under the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program (“CGDP”) as a reduction of sales. Under the CGDP, patients reaching the annual coverage gap threshold are eligible for reimbursement coverage for out-of-pocket costs for covered prescription drugs. Under an agreement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, manufacturers are responsible for reimbursement of prescription plan sponsors for the portion of out-of-pocket expenses not covered under their Medicare plans. Actual Medicaid Part D rebates have not differed materially from our estimates.

Manufacturing Revenue

We recognize manufacturing revenues from the sale of products we manufacture for resale by our licensees. Substantially all of our manufacturing revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the product passes to the licensee. The sales price for certain of our manufacturing revenues is based on the end-market sales price earned by our licensees. As end-market sales generally occur after we have recorded manufacturing revenue, we estimate the sales price for such products based on information supplied to us by our licensees, our historical transaction experience and other third-party data. Differences between actual manufacturing revenues and estimated manufacturing revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is generally within the same quarter. The differences between our actual and estimated manufacturing revenues have not been material to date.

Royalty Revenue

We recognize royalty revenues related to the sale by our licensees of products that incorporate our technology. All of our royalties qualify for the sales-and-usage exemption under Topic 606 as (i) such royalties are based strictly on the sales-and-usage by

64

the licensee; and (ii) a license of IP is the sole or predominant item to which such royalties relate. Based on this exemption, such royalties are earned in the period the products are sold by our licensees and we have a present right to payment.

Certain of our royalty revenues are recognized based on information supplied to us by our licensees and require estimates to be made. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is generally within the same quarter. The differences between our actual and estimated royalty revenues have not been material to date.

Discontinued operations

We determined that the separation of our former oncology business, which was completed on November 15, 2023, represented a disposal plan that met the criteria for classification of the oncology business as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASC 205-20, 
Discontinued Operations
. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods have been updated to present the assets and liabilities associated with the oncology business separately as discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet and the results of such discontinued operations reported as a separate component of income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

For additional information related to discontinued operations, see Note 3, 
Discontinued Operations
, in our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, other than goodwill which is separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset.

When reviewing long-lived assets for impairment, we group long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.

Goodwill

We evaluate goodwill for impairment for our reporting units annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the reporting units may not be recoverable. A reporting unit is an operating segment, as defined by GAAP, or a component of an operating segment. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed by management. Two or more components of an operating segment may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of December 31, 2024, we have one operating segment and two reporting units. Our goodwill, which solely relates to the Business Combination, has been assigned to one reporting unit which consists of the former EDT business.

We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we elect this option and determine, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Among other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of reporting units, we consider individual factors, such as microeconomic conditions, changes in the industry and the markets in which we operate as well as historical and expected future financial performance. Alternatively, we may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and instead immediately perform the quantitative impairment test.

On October 31, 2024, we elected to perform a qualitative impairment test and determined that, based on the weight of all available evidence, the fair value of the reporting unit more-likely-than-not exceeded its carrying value.

65

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets

We evaluate the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances based on a more-likely-than-not standard. The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. We consider the following possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets:

•
future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;

•
future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards;

•
taxable income in prior carryback years; and

•
tax-planning strategies.

The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors including, but not limited to:

•
nature, frequency and severity of recent losses;

•
duration of statutory carryforward periods;

•
historical experience with tax attributes expiring unused; and

•
near- and medium-term financial outlook.

We utilize a rolling three years of actual and current year anticipated results as the primary measures of cumulative income (losses) in recent years. For additional information related to our assessment of our valuation allowance, see Note 17, 
Income Taxes
 in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report.

The evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. Changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated events or otherwise, could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For information related to risks surrounding our deferred tax assets, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this Annual Report and specifically the section entitled “Our deferred tax assets may not be realized.”

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
, “New Accounting Pronouncements” in our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report for discussion, if any, of new accounting standards.

Item 7A. 
Quantitative and Qualitat
ive Disclosures about Market Risk

We hold securities in our investment portfolio that are sensitive to market risks. Our securities with fixed interest rates may have their market value adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to a fall in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. Should interest rates fluctuate by 10%, our interest income would change by an immaterial amount over an annual period. We do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk as our investment policies specify credit quality standards for our investments and limit the amount of credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of investment.

We do not believe our exposure to liquidity and credit risk to be significant as approximately 41% and 59% of our investments at December 31, 2024 are in corporate debt securities with a minimum rating of A2 (Moody’s)/A (Standard and Poor’s) and debt securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies, respectively. We have the intent and ability to hold these securities until recovery, which may be at maturity.

66

Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Manufacturing and royalty revenues that we receive on certain of our products and services are a percentage of the net sales made by our licensees, and a portion of these sales are made in countries outside the U.S. and are denominated in currencies in which the product is sold, which is predominantly the euro. The manufacturing and royalty payments on these non-U.S. sales are calculated initially in the currency in which the sale is made and are then converted into USD to determine the amount that our licensees pay us for manufacturing and royalty revenues. Fluctuations in the exchange ratio of the USD and these non-U.S. currencies will have the effect of increasing or decreasing our revenues even if there is a constant amount of sales in non-U.S. currencies. For example, if the USD weakens against a non-U.S. currency, then our revenues will increase given a constant amount of sales in such non-U.S. currency. For the year ended December 31, 2024, an average 10% strengthening of the USD relative to the currencies in which these products are sold would have resulted in revenues being reduced by approximately $8.9 million, as compared to a reduction in revenues of approximately $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

We incur significant operating costs in Ireland and face exposure to changes in the exchange ratio of the USD and the euro arising from expenses and payables at our Irish operations that are settled in euro. The impact of changes in the exchange ratio of the USD and the euro on our USD-denominated revenues earned in countries other than the U.S. is partially offset by the opposite impact of changes in the exchange ratio of the USD and the euro on operating expenses and payables incurred at our Irish operations that are settled in euro. For the year ended December 31, 2024, an average 10% weakening in the USD relative to the euro would have resulted in an increase to our expenses denominated in euro of approximately $3.9 million, as compared to an increase in our expenses of approximately $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Controls
 and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Controls and Procedures

Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer’s board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:

•
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer;

68

•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and

•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness for future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in its 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in this Annual Report, beginning on page F-1.

Item 9B.

Report of Independent R
egistere
d Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Alkermes plc

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alkermes plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), of shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

F-
1

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Rebate Accruals – Medicaid Drug Rebate Program

As described in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with the Company’s customers, health care providers or payers. The Company records accruals for rebates to U.S. states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program as a reduction of sales when the product is shipped into the distribution channel using the expected value method. As of December 31, 2024, accrued Medicaid rebates were $202.0 million, of which a significant amount related to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The Company rebates individual U.S. states for all eligible units purchased under the Medicaid program based on a rebate per unit calculation, which is based on the Company’s average manufacturer prices. The Company estimates expected unit sales to individuals covered by Medicaid and rebates per unit under the Medicaid program and adjusts its rebate accrual based on actual unit sales and rebates per unit and changes in trends in Medicaid utilization.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to rebate accruals for the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management due to significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing the reserves, as the reserves are based on assumptions developed using historical experience, current contractual requirements, specific known market events and payment patterns and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in applying procedures and evaluating evidence related to these assumptions.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to rebate accruals for the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate the rebate accruals. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebate accruals by utilizing third-party data related to product sales, the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid and consideration of contractual requirement changes and market events; (ii) comparing the independent estimate to management’s estimate; and (iii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company.

ALKERMES PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Alkermes plc is a global biopharmaceutical company that seeks to develop innovative medicines in the field of neuroscience. Alkermes has a portfolio of proprietary commercial products for the treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder and a pipeline of clinical and preclinical candidates in development for neurological disorders, including narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. Headquartered in Ireland, Alkermes also has a corporate office and research and development (“R&D”) center in Massachusetts and a manufacturing facility in Ohio.
In May 2024, the Company completed the sale of its development and manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland (the “Athlone Facility”) and related business to Novo Nordisk (“Novo”) pursuant to an asset purchase agreement entered into in December 2023. The Company and Novo also entered into subcontracting arrangements to continue certain development and manufacturing activities performed at the Athlone Facility for a period of time after the closing of the transaction, which activities may continue through the end of 2025. In connection with the sale of the Athlone Facility, the Company received $
97.9
 million from Novo, which included a payment of approximately $
91.0
 million for the facility and certain related assets, and recorded a gain of approximately $
1.5
 million within “
Other income (expense), net
” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company classified the assets described under the asset purchase agreement for the sale as “Assets held for sale” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
In November 2023, the Company completed the separation of its former oncology business into Mural Oncology plc (“Mural”), a new, independent, publicly-traded company (the “Separation”). The Separation was effected by means of a distribution of all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Mural to the Company’s shareholders (the “Distribution”), in which each of the 
Company’s shareholders received one ordinary share, nominal value $
0.01
 per share, of Mural for every 
ten
 ordinary shares, par value $
0.01
 per share, of the Company
 (the “Distribution Ratio”) held by such shareholder as of the close of business on November 6, 2023, the record date for the Distribution (the “Record Date”). The historical results of the oncology business have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated financial statements through November 15, 2023 (the “Separation Date”). For additional information related to the Separation, see Note 3, 
Discontinued Operations
 in these “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Alkermes plc and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not sum due to rounding.
Reclassification
The Company has presented its former oncology business as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. See Note 3, 
Discontinued Operations
 in these “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report for additional information.
Discontinued Operations
The Company determined that the Separation met the criteria for classification of the former oncology business as discontinued operations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205, 
Discontinued Operations
. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been updated to present the results of the oncology business as discontinued operations through the Separation Date for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Assets Held for Sale
In connection with the sale of the Athlone Facility, the Company reviewed FASB ASC 805, 
Business Combinations 
(“Topic 805”)

and, based on the definitions therein, determined that the Athlone Facility constituted a business. Accordingly, the assets associated with the sale of the Athlone Facility were classified as “Assets held for sale” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.

ALKERMES PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires that Company management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, judgments and methodologies, including but not limited to, those related to revenue from contracts with its customers and related allowances, impairment of intangibles and long-lived assets, share-based compensation, income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, valuation of investments and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company values its cash and cash equivalents at cost plus accrued interest, which the Company believes approximates its market value. The Company considers as cash equivalents only those investments that are highly liquid, readily convertible into cash and so near their maturity (three months from the date of purchase) that they present insignificant risk of change in value because of interest rate changes.
Investments
The Company has investments in various types of securities, consisting primarily of United States (“U.S.”). government and agency obligations and corporate debt securities. The Company generally holds its interest-bearing investments with major financial institutions and in accordance with documented investment policies. The Company limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or corporate issuer. At December 31, 2024, substantially all these investments were classified as available-for-sale and were recorded at fair value.

Unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in equity, net of related tax, unless: (i) the security has experienced a credit loss; (ii) the Company has determined that it has the intent to sell the security; or (iii) the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that it will have to sell the security before its expected recovery. Periodic reviews are conducted to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss in accordance with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.
For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the Company performs an analysis to assess whether it intends to sell, or whether it would more likely than not be required to sell, the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. Where the Company intends to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the security’s decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is reflected in earnings as an impairment loss.
Regardless of the Company’s intent to sell a security, the Company performs additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security. Credit losses are identified where the Company does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security.
The Company’s held-to-maturity investments are restricted investments held as collateral under letters of credit related to certain of the Company’s agreements and are included in “Investments—long-term,” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value and are classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy, as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurement. At December 31, 2024, the Company’s financial assets consisted of cash equivalents and investments and are classified within the fair value hierarchy as follows:
•
Level 1
–these valuations are based on a market approach using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Valuations of these products do not require a significant degree of judgment. Assets utilizing Level 1 inputs at December 31, 2024 included U.S. treasury securities, marketable securities classified as cash equivalents and a fixed term deposit account; and 
•
Level 2
–these valuations are based on quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active markets or other market observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, foreign currency spot rates and option pricing valuation models. Assets utilizing Level 2 inputs at December 31, 2024 included U.S. government agency debt securities and investments in corporate debt securities that are trading in the credit markets.

ALKERMES PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, contract assets, other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued sales discounts, allowances and reserves approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The Company utilizes a standard cost basis, which approximates cost determined using the first-in first-out method. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Included in inventory are raw materials used in production of preclinical and clinical products, which have alternative future use and are charged to R&D expense when consumed. The cost elements included within inventory include three primary categories for commercial products: cost of raw materials; direct labor; and overhead. Overhead is based on the normal capacity of the Company’s production facility and does not include costs from abnormally low production or idle capacity, which are expensed directly to the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with its products prior to regulatory approval when, based on management’s judgment, future commercialization of the product is considered probable and future economic benefit from such product is expected to be realized. The Company assesses the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process, including any known safety, efficacy or quality concerns, potential labeling restrictions and other potential impediments to approval. The Company also considers the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and considers issues that may prevent or delay commercialization, including issues that may arise in relation to the manufacturing of the product. The Company expenses previously capitalized costs related to pre-approval inventory upon a change in such judgment, due to, among other potential factors, a denial or significant delay of approval by relevant regulatory agencies or other issues that may make the pre-approval inventory batches less likely or unlikely to be commercialized and to result in future economic benefit.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, subject to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred and major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets:

Asset group

Term

Buildings and improvements

25
 years

Furniture, fixtures and equipment

5
 - 
7
 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of useful life or lease term

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess cost of the Company’s investment in the net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. The Company’s goodwill consists solely of goodwill created as a result of the Company’s acquisition of Elan Drug Technologies (“EDT”) from Elan Corporation, plc (such acquisition, the “Business Combination”) in September 2011 and has been assigned to one reporting unit. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment or a component to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded.
Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill might not be recoverable. The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. If the Company elects this option and believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, the Company may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative impairment test. In the quantitative impairment test, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the Company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
When some, but not all, of a reporting unit is to be disposed of, the accounting for that reporting unit’s goodwill will depend on whether the disposal group constitutes a business. If the disposal group constitutes a business, the Company attributes a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the disposal group based on the relative fair values of: (i) the disposal group; and (ii) the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained.

ALKERMES PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The Company’s finite-lived intangible assets, consisting of core developed technology and collaboration agreements acquired as part of the Business Combination, were recorded at fair value at the time of their acquisition and are stated within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets net of accumulated amortization. The finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the economic use method, which reflects the pattern that the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed as revenue is generated from the underlying patent or contract. The useful lives of the Company’s intangible assets are primarily based on the legal or contractual life of the underlying patent or contract, which does not include additional years for the potential extension or renewal of the contract or patent.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset; a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset; a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash-flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset; or a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their estimated fair values. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to sell them.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue following the five-step model prescribed in accordance with FASB ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“Topic 606”): (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligations.

Product Sales, Net
The Company’s product sales, net consist of sales in the U.S. of VIVITROL
®
, ARISTADA
®
, ARISTADA INITIO
®
 and LYBALVI
®
, primarily to wholesalers, specialty distributors and pharmacies. Product sales, net are recognized when the customer obtains control of the product, which is when the product has been received by the customer.
Revenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with the Company’s customers, healthcare providers or payers. The Company’s process for estimating reserves established for these variable consideration components does not differ materially from historical practices. The transaction price, which includes variable consideration reflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject to constraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of the cumulative revenues recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from the Company’s estimates. If actual results vary, the Company adjusts these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment. The following are the Company’s significant categories of sales discounts and allowances:
•
Medicaid Rebates
—the Company records accruals for rebates to U.S. states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program as a reduction of sales when the product is shipped into the distribution channel using the expected value method. The Company rebates individual U.S. states for all eligible units purchased under the Medicaid program based on a rebate per unit calculation, which is based on the Company’s average manufacturer prices. The Company estimates expected unit sales to individuals covered by Medicaid and rebates per unit under the Medicaid program and adjusts its rebate accrual based on actual unit sales and rebates per unit and changes in trends in Medicaid utilization. In 2024, actual Medicaid utilization rates related to VIVITROL were lower than original estimates, due, in part, to $
8.7
 million in actual credits received from certain states in the fourth quarter of 2024 related to duplicate Medicaid billings. Medicaid rebates for the Company’s other products have not differed materially from the Company’s estimates; 
•
Chargebacks
—discounts that occur when contracted indirect customers purchase directly from wholesalers and specialty distributors. Contracted customers generally purchase a product at its contracted price. The wholesaler or specialty distributor, in turn, then generally charges back to the Company the difference between the wholesale acquisition cost and the contracted price paid to the wholesaler or specialty distributor by the customer. The allowance for chargebacks is made using the expected value method and is based on actual and expected utilization of these programs. Chargebacks could exceed historical experience and the Company’s estimates of future participation in these programs. To date, actual chargebacks have not differed materially from the Company’s estimates;

F-

ALKERMES PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

•
Product Discounts
—cash consideration, including sales incentives, given by the Company under agreements with a number of wholesaler, distributor, pharmacy, and treatment provider customers that provide them with a discount on the purchase price of products. The reserve is made using the expected value method and to date, actual product discounts have not differed materially from the Company’s estimates; 
•
Product Returns
—the Company records an estimate for product returns at the time its customers take control of their product. The Company estimates this liability using the expected returns of product sold based on historical return levels and specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates. Return amounts are recorded as a reduction of sales. Once product is returned, it is destroyed. To date, actual product returns have not differed materially from the Company’s estimates; and
•
Medicare Part D
—the Company records accruals for Medicare Part D liabilities under the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program (“CGDP”) as a reduction of sales. Under the CGDP, patients reaching the annual coverage gap threshold are eligible for reimbursement coverage for out-of-pocket costs for covered prescription drugs. Under an agreement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, manufacturers are responsible to reimburse prescription plan sponsors for the portion of out-of-pocket expenses not covered under their Medicare plans. To date, actual Medicare Part D rebates have not differed materially from the Company’s estimates.

Collaborative Arrangements
The Company has entered into collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies including, among others, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Janssen, Inc.”), Janssen Pharmaceutica International, a division of Cilag International AG (“Janssen International”), and Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. (together with Janssen, Inc., Janssen International and their affiliates, “Janssen”) related to INVEGA SUSTENNA

/XEPLION
®
, INVEGA TRINZA
®
/TREVICTA
®
, INVEGA HAFYERA

/BYANNLI
®
 (collectively, the “long-acting INVEGA products”) and RISPERDAL CONSTA
®
, and Biogen International GmbH (together with its affiliates, “Biogen”) related to VUMERITY
®
. Substantially all of the products developed under these arrangements are currently being marketed as approved products for which the Company received or receives payments for manufacturing services and/or royalties on net product sales.
Manufacturing Revenue

The Company recognizes manufacturing revenues from the sale of products it manufactures for resale by its licensees. Substantially all of the manufacturing revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the product passes to the licensee. The sales price for certain of the Company’s manufacturing revenues is based on the end-market sales price earned by its licensees. As end-market sales generally occur after the Company has recorded manufacturing revenue, the Company estimates the sales price for such products based on information supplied to it by the Company’s licensees, its historical transaction experience and other third-party data. Differences between actual manufacturing revenues and estimated manufacturing revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is generally within the same quarter. The differences between the Company’s actual and estimated manufacturing revenues have not been material to date.
Royalty Revenue
The Company recognizes royalty revenues related to the sale by its licensees of products that incorporate the Company’s technologies. All of the Company’s royalties qualify for the sales-and-usage exemption under Topic 606 as (i) such royalties are based strictly on the sales-and-usage by the licensee; and (ii) a license of IP is the sole or predominant item to which such royalties relate. Based on this exemption, these royalties are earned in the period that the products are sold by the Company’s licensee and the Company has a present right to payment.

Certain of the Company’s royalty revenues are recognized by the Company based on information supplied to the Company by its licensees and require estimates to be made. Differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period in which they become known, which is generally within the same quarter. The differences between the Company’s actual and estimated royalty revenues have not been material to date.
Receivables, net
Receivables, net, include amounts billed and amounts unbilled but currently unconditionally due from customers. The amounts due are stated at their net estimated realizable value. The Company’s unbilled receivable balance was $
69.5
 million and $
103.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and related primarily to royalty revenue. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amounts of receivables that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer creditworthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables and collateral to the extent applicable. The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $
0.3
 million and $
0.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Contract Assets
Contract assets include unbilled amounts that will result in a sale under certain of the Company’s manufacturing contracts. The amounts included in the contract assets table below are classified as “Current assets” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as they relate to manufacturing processes that are completed in 
ten days
 to 
eight weeks

Foreign Currency
The Company’s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. The resulting monetary assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the subsequent balance sheet date. Gains and losses as a result of translation adjustments are recorded within “Other income (expense), net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded losses of $
0.8
 million and $
0.5
 million and a gain of $
0.7
 million, respectively, on foreign currency translation.
Concentrations
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are receivables and marketable securities. Billings to large pharmaceutical companies and pharmaceutical wholesalers account for the majority of the Company’s receivables, and collateral is not required from these customers. To mitigate credit risk, the Company monitors the financial performance and credit-worthiness of its customers. 
The following represents revenue and receivables from the Company’s customers exceeding

Research and Development Expenses
For each of its R&D programs, the Company incurs both external and internal expenses. External R&D expenses include fees related to clinical and preclinical activities performed by contract research organizations, consulting fees and costs related to laboratory services, purchases of drug product materials and third-party manufacturing development costs. Internal R&D expenses include employee-related expenses, occupancy costs, depreciation and general overhead. The Company tracks external R&D expenses for each of its development programs, however, internal R&D expenses are not tracked by individual program as they benefit multiple development programs or the Company’s products or technologies in general.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses are primarily comprised of employee-related expenses associated with selling and marketing, finance, human resources, legal, information technology and other administrative personnel, outside marketing, advertising, financial and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs.

107.6
 million, $
127.6
 million and $
41.4
 million, respectively.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company’s share-based compensation programs permit grants of awards in the form of stock options and restricted stock unit awards (“RSUs”), which vest with the passage of time and/or based on the achievement of certain performance criteria. The Company issues new shares upon the exercise of stock options or the vesting of RSUs. Under the terms of the Company’s stock option and incentive plans (the “Plans”), the Company’s employees may, at the discretion of the plan administrator, become eligible in certain circumstances set forth in the Plans for accelerated vesting of certain awards granted to them under the Plans. In such circumstances, if there are no effective future service requirements for such employees, the remaining fair value of any such accelerated awards would be expensed as of the date of acceleration.
Time-Based Stock Options
Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Plan or award certificate, stock option grants to employees expire 
ten years
 from the date of grant and generally vest in 
four
 equal annual installments, commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant, provided the employee remains continuously employed or in a service relationship with the Company during the applicable vesting period. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Plan or Award Certificate (as defined in the 2018 Plan): (i) annual stock option grants to non-employee directors expire 
ten years
 from the date of grant and generally vest over a 
one-year
 period; and (ii) stock option grants to new non-employee directors expire 
ten years
 from the date of grant and generally vest over a 
three-year
 period. The estimated fair value of options is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
The fair value of stock option grants is based on estimates as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Company uses historical data as the basis for estimating stock option terms and forfeitures. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical stock option exercise and forfeiture behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The ranges of expected terms disclosed below reflect different expected behavior among certain groups of employees. Expected stock volatility factors are based on a weighted average of implied volatilities from traded options of the Company’s ordinary shares and historical share price volatility of the Company’s ordinary shares, which is determined based on a review of the weighted average of historical weekly price changes of the Company’s ordinary shares. The risk-free interest rate for periods commensurate with the expected term of the stock option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield on the Company’s ordinary shares is estimated to be zero as the Company has not paid dividends and does not expect to pay dividends in the near future. The exercise price of options granted is equal to the closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.
The fair value of each stock option granted was estimated on the grant date with the following weighted-average assumptions:

Time-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards
Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Plan or award certificate, time-based RSUs awarded to employees generally vest in 
four
 equal annual installments, commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant, provided the employee remains continuously employed or in a service relationship with the Company during the applicable vesting period. Shares subject to these RSUs are delivered to the employee upon vesting, subject to payment of applicable withholding taxes. The fair value of time-based RSUs is equal to the closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant. Compensation expense, including the effect of forfeitures, is recognized over the applicable service period.

F-
15

ALKERMES PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards
Performance-based RSUs awarded to employees vest upon the achievement of certain performance criteria, typically during or following the end of a specified performance period. The estimated fair value of these performance-based RSUs are generally based on the closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant, unless the performance-based RSU is also subject to a market condition. In that case, the fair value of the performance-based RSU is based on a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized from the date the Company determines the performance criteria probable of being achieved to the date the award, or relevant portion of the award, is expected to vest. Cumulative adjustments are recorded on a quarterly basis to reflect subsequent changes to the estimated outcome of the performance criteria until the date that the final outcome of the performance criteria is determined.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In evaluating the Company’s ability to recover its deferred tax assets, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence including its past operating results, the existence of cumulative income in the most recent fiscal years, changes in the business in which the Company operates and its forecast of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, the Company is responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of Irish and non-Irish pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates that the Company is using to manage the underlying business.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. The Company evaluates its tax position on a quarterly basis. The Company also accrues for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) includes changes in equity that are excluded from net income (loss), such as unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale investments.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per ordinary share from continuing operations is calculated based upon net income (loss) from continuing operations available to holders of ordinary shares divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Basic loss per ordinary share from discontinued operations is calculated based upon net loss from discontinued operations available to holders of ordinary shares, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. For the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per ordinary share from continuing operations and discontinuing operations, the Company utilizes the treasury stock method and adjusts the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the potential dilutive effect of outstanding ordinary share equivalents such as stock options and RSUs.
Segment Information
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure 
(“Topic 280”) to establish standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise engaging in business activities for which separate financial information is available and regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company has utilized the management approach to determine that the Company is managed as one segment on a consolidated basis and is the business of developing, manufacturing and commercializing medicines designed to address unmet medical needs of patients in major therapeutic areas. The Company’s CODM, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, reviews the Company’s operating results on an aggregate basis and manages the Company’s operations as a single operating unit. The CODM measures profitability on a reportable segment basis using net income (loss) and utilizes this information in allocating resources and in assessing performance by monitoring budget versus actual results. Please refer to Note 18, 
Segment Reporting
, in these “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report for further information.

New Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes 
(“Topic 740”)
: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, 
to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures in order to provide information to assist key stakeholders in better assessing how the Company’s operations and related tax risks and tax planning and operational opportunities affect the Company’s tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. This ASU becomes effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This guidance will be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
, to improve disclosures about a public business entity’s expenses and address requests from investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses (including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization and depletion) in commonly-presented expense captions, such as cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development. All disclosure requirements under this guidance are required for public business entities and effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments in this guidance will be applied prospectively to financial statements for periods after the effective dates. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Mural Oncology Separation

In November 2023, the Company completed the Separation. In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a separation agreement with Mural, dated as of November 13, 2023, that, among other things, set forth the Company’s agreements with Mural regarding the principal actions taken or to be taken in connection with the Separation, including the Distribution. The separation agreement identified those assets to be transferred to, liabilities to be assumed by and contracts to be assigned to Mural, including the operating lease for the office and laboratory space at 852 Winter Street in Waltham, Massachusetts, as part of the Separation, and it provided for when and how such transfers, assumptions and assignments were to occur. The purpose of the separation agreement was to provide Mural and the Company with those assets necessary to operate their respective businesses and to retain or assume the respective liabilities related to those assets.

Each of Mural and the Company agreed to releases with respect to pre-Distribution claims, and cross-indemnities with respect to post-Distribution claims, that are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities allocated to Mural under the separation agreement with Mural, and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities allocated to the Company under the separation agreement with the Company. The Company and Mural are also each subject to mutual six-month employee non-solicitation and non-hire restrictions, subject to certain customary exceptions, and certain confidentiality restrictions and information sharing obligations.

The Company determined that the Separation and related Distribution qualified as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which required significant judgment by management. In making such determinations, the Company applied U.S. federal tax law to relevant facts and circumstances and obtained: (i) a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS; (ii) a tax opinion; and (iii) other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the Separation and Distribution were to ultimately fail to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company and/or its shareholders could be subject to significant liabilities, which could have material adverse impacts on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods. Furthermore, other than taxes recorded on the transfer of intellectual property, the Company determined that the Separation and related Distribution qualified as tax-free for Irish tax purposes, which required significant judgment by management. In making such determinations, the Company applied Irish tax law to relevant facts and circumstances and obtained: (i) a tax opinion; and (ii) other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the Separation and Distribution were to ultimately fail to qualify for tax-free treatment for Irish tax purposes, the Company and/or its shareholders could be subject to significant liabilities, which could have material adverse impacts on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.

In connection with the Separation, the Company also entered into a tax matters agreement with Mural, dated as of 
November 13, 2023
. The tax matters agreement governs the Company’s and Mural’s respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes (including taxes arising in the ordinary course of business and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes), tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings, and assistance and cooperation in respect of tax matters.

In connection with the Separation, the Company also entered into the Employee Matters Agreement. The Employee Matters Agreement, as amended, governs the Company’s, Mural’s and their respective subsidiaries’ and affiliates’ rights, responsibilities and obligations after the Separation with respect to, employment, benefits and compensation matters relating to employees and former employees (and their respective dependents and beneficiaries) who are or were associated with the Company, including those who became employees of Mural in connection with the Separation; the allocation of assets and liabilities generally relating to employees, employment or service-related matters and employee benefit plans; other human resources, employment and employee benefits matters; and the treatment of equity-based awards granted by the Company prior to the Separation.

Discontinued Operations

The results of the former oncology business and transaction costs related to the Separation have been reflected as “Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes” in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) through the Separation Date. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this presentation. The transaction costs related to the Separation were $
36.0
 million during 2023 and $
1.4
 million during 2022, and primarily relate to professional fees for separation activities within the finance, tax, legal and information technology functions.

In November 2021, the Company received notice of partial termination of an exclusive license agreement with Janssen. Under this license agreement, the Company provided Janssen with rights to, and know-how, training and technical assistance in respect of, the Company’s small particle pharmaceutical compound technology, known as NanoCrystal technology, which was used to develop the long-acting INVEGA products. When the partial termination became effective in February 2022, Janssen ceased paying royalties related to sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA, INVEGA TRINZA and INVEGA HAFYERA. Accordingly, the Company ceased recognizing royalty revenue related to sales of these products in February 2022. In April 2022, the Company commenced binding arbitration proceedings related to, among other things, Janssen’s partial termination of this license agreement and Janssen’s royalty and other obligations under the agreement. In May 2023, the arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”) in the arbitration proceedings issued a final award (the “Final Award”) which concluded the arbitration proceedings. The Final Award provided, among other things, that the Company was due back royalties of $
195.4
 million, inclusive of $
8.1
 million in late-payment interest related to 2022 U.S. net sales of the long-acting INVEGA products, which amount the Company received from Janssen in the second quarter of 2023, and is entitled to 2023 and future royalty revenues from Janssen related to net sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA through August 20, 2024, INVEGA TRINZA through the second quarter of 2030 (but no later than May 2030 when the license agreement expires) and INVEGA HAFYERA through May 2030 (when the license agreement expires).

Following issuance of the Final Award, the Company recognized royalty revenues related to the back royalties noted above and resumed recognizing royalty revenue related to ongoing U.S. sales of the long-acting INVEGA products. During 2023, the Company recor
ded $
486.1
 mill
ion in royalty revenue from sales of the long-acting INVEGA products, including $
195.4
 million related to back royalties and associated interest related to net sales of the long-acting INVEGA in the U.S. in 2022 and resumed recognizing royalty revenue related to worldwide net sales of the long-acting INVEGA products of approximately $
290.7
 million, as compared to royalty revenue of $
115.7
 million during 2022.

In October 2022 and November 2022, an arbitration panel found that the Company must return to Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (“Acorda”) $
16.5
 million (inclusive of prejudgment interest and administrative fees) and $
1.8
 million 
(inclusive of prejudgment interest), respectively, previously paid by Acorda under a license agreement between the Company and Acorda. These amounts

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

represented 
a portion of the royalty revenue paid to the Company by Acorda since July 2020 related to AMPYRA. The Company paid Acorda the aggregate $
18.3
 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company had recorded $
3.2
 million of royalty revenue related to AMPYRA as the Company believed that it had met the necessary revenue recognition criteria under Topic 606. However, as a result of the arbitration ruling, the Company reversed the $
3.2
 million as the panel found that the Company was no longer entitled to be paid those royalties. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded both the $
18.3
 million in repayments and the $
3.2
 million reversal as reversals of royalty revenue within “Manufacturing and royalty revenue” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The amounts related to such arbitration ruling were included as part of “Other” within the manufacturing and royalty revenue table above for the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result of the arbitration ruling, the Company has no contractual obligation to manufacture and supply AMPYRA or contractual right to receive future manufacturing or royalty revenue related to AMPYRA. Refer to Note 19, 
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities 
within the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report for information regarding additional legal proceedings related to the arbitration with Acorda.

At December 31, 2024, the Company reviewed its investment portfolio to assess whether the unrealized losses on its available-for-sale investments were temporary. Investments with unrealized losses consisted primarily of corporate debt securities and debt securities issued and backed by U.S. agencies and the U.S. government. At December 31, 2024, 
77
 of the Company’s 
320
 investment securities were in an unrealized loss position and had an aggregate estimated fair value of $
112.7
 million. Approximately 
41
% and 
59
% 
of the Company’s investment securities at December 31, 2024 were in corporate debt securities, with a minimum rating of A2

ALKERMES PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Moody’s)/A 
(Standard and Poor’s), and debt securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies, respectively. The primary reason for the unrealized losses in the Company’s investment portfolio is that its investments are fixed-rate securities acquired in a rising interest rate environment. In making the determination whether the decline in fair value of these securities was temporary, the Company evaluated whether it intended to sell the security and whether it was more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the security before recovering its amortized cost basis. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these investments until recovery, which may be at maturity.
Realized gains and losses on the sales and maturities of investments, which were identified using the specific identification method, were as follows:

The Company transfers its financial assets and liabilities, measured at fair value on a recurring basis, between the fair value hierarchies at the end of each reporting period.
There were 
no
 transfers of any securities between levels during the year ended December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, the Company had 
no
 investments with fair values that were determined using Level 3 inputs.

The Company’s investments in U.S. government and agency debt securities, non-U.S. government agency debt securities and corporate debt securities classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy were initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, utilizing market-observable data. The market-observable data included reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers, current spot rates and other industry and economic events. The Company validated the prices developed using the market-observable data by obtaining market values from other pricing sources, analyzing pricing data in certain instances and confirming that the relevant markets are active.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In April 2015, the Company sold its Gainesville, GA manufacturing facility, the related manufacturing and royalty revenue associated with certain products manufactured at the facility, and the rights to IV/IM and parenteral forms of Meloxicam to Recro Pharma, Inc. (“Recro”) and Recro Gainesville LLC (such transaction the “Gainesville Transaction”). The Gainesville Transaction included in the purchase price contingent consideration tied to low double digit royalties on net sales of the IV/IM and parenteral forms of Meloxicam and any other product with the same active ingredient as Meloxicam IV/IM that is discovered or identified using certain of the Company’s IP to which Recro was provided a right of use, through license or transfer, pursuant to the Gainesville Transaction (such products, the “Meloxicam Products”), and milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones related to the Meloxicam Products.

In November 2019, Recro spun out its acute care segment to Baudax Bio, Inc. (“Baudax”), a publicly-traded pharmaceutical company. As part of this transaction, Recro’s obligations to pay certain contingent consideration from the Gainesville Transaction were assigned and/or transferred to Baudax.
In Baudax’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2022, Baudax continued to include disclosures regarding its ability to continue as a going concern, which first appeared in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2021. In March 2022, Baudax reduced its workforce by approximately 
80
%, which was designed to reduce its operational expenses and conserve its cash resources. In light of Baudax’s disclosures and the fact that, as of September 30, 2022, Baudax had only paid $
1.2
 million of the $
6.4
 million that was due to the Company in March 2022, the Company determined, during the three months ended September 30, 2022, that it was unlikely to collect any further proceeds under this arrangement and reduced the fair value of the contingent consideration to zero within “Change in the fair value of contingent consideration” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2022, the Company determined that certain construction in progress related to the manufacture of ANJESO
®
 had no future value and recorded a $
2.3
 million write off within “Other income (expense), net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In December 2022, Baudax announced that it would discontinue the sale of ANJESO and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) acknowledged the discontinuation of sale of ANJESO via listing in the Orange Book.

Amounts included as construction in progress in the consolidated balance sheets primarily include capital expenditures at the Company’s manufacturing facility in Wilmington, Ohio. The Company continues to evaluate its manufacturing capacity based on expectations of demand for its products and will continue to record such amounts within construction in progress until such time as the underlying assets are placed into service. The Company continues to periodically evaluate whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable.
In December 2023, the Company determined that $

The Company’s finite-lived intangible assets primarily consisted of collaborative agreements and the NanoCrystal and oral controlled release technologies acquired as part of the EDT acquisition. These intangible assets were fully amortized in the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company recorded $
1.1
 million, $
35.7

The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2024. The Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment test and determined that based on the weight of all available evidence, the fair value of the reporting unit more-likely-than-not exceeded its carrying value.

10. LEASES

All of the Company’s leases are accounted for as operating leases. The Company leases approximately 
231,000
 square feet of office and laboratory space located at 900 Winter Street in Waltham, Massachusetts (the “900 Winter Street Lease”). The initial term of the lease commenced on 
January 20, 2020
, expires in 
2035
 and includes an option to 
extend 
the term for an additional 
ten-year
 period.

On November 13, 2023, in connection with the Separation, Alkermes, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Alkermes US”) and Mural Oncology, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mural (“Mural US”) entered into an assignment and assumption of lease agreement (the “Assignment”), pursuant to which Alkermes US assigned to Mural US an operating lease for approximately 
180,000
 square feet of corporate office space, administrative areas and laboratories located at 852 Winter Street in Waltham, Massachusetts (the “852 Winter Street Lease”). Under the terms of the Assignment, Mural US assumed all of Alkermes US’ obligations under the 852 Winter Street Lease. In accordance with FASB ASC 842, 
Leases
, as the Company can no longer access or direct the use of the asset following the Assignment, the 852 Winter Street Lease no longer meets the definition of a lease for the Company. On November 15, 2023, the effective date of the Assignment, the Company reduced its right-of-use asset and lease liability by $
14.5
 million and $
15.4
 million, respectively in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

13. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic earnings (loss) per ordinary share from continuing operations is calculated based upon net income (loss) from continuing operations available to holders of ordinary shares divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Basic loss per ordinary share from discontinued operations is calculated based upon net loss from discontinued operations available to holders of ordinary shares, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. For the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per ordinary share from continuing operations and discontinuing operations, the Company utilizes the treasury stock method and adjusts the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the potential dilutive effect of outstanding ordinary share equivalents such as stock options and RSUs.

14. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Share Repurchase Program
In February 2024, the Company’s board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase ordinary shares of the Company in an aggregate amount of up to $
400.0
 million (exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases) from time to time on the open market (the “Repurchase Program”). The specific timing and amounts of repurchases under the Repurchase Program will depend on a variety of factors, including but not limited to ongoing assessments of the Company’s needs, alternative investment opportunities, the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares and general market conditions. The Repurchase Program has no set expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 
7.9
 million of its ordinary shares under the Repurchase Program at an average price of $
25.33
 per share, resulting in a total cost, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchase of $
200.0
 million. All ordinary shares repurchased were returned to treasury. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining amount authorized under the Repurchase Program was $
200.0
 million.

Share-Based Compensation Plans
The Company has 
one
 share-based compensation plan pursuant to which awards are currently being made: the 2018 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2018 Plan”). The Company has 
two
 share-based compensation plans pursuant to which outstanding awards have been made, but from which no further awards can or will be made: the Alkermes plc Amended and Restated 2008 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as amended, (the “2008 Plan”) and the Alkermes plc 2011 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2011 Plan,” and together with the 2018 Plan and the 2008 Plan, the “the Alkermes Stock Option and Incentive Plans”). Effective May 20, 2020, the 2018 Plan was amended such that any shares underlying any outstanding awards granted under the 2011 Plan or the 2008 Plan that are forfeited, canceled, repurchased or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) from and after such date will become available for issuance pursuant to the 2018 Plan, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the terms of the 2011 Plan or the 2008 Plan.
The 2018 Plan allows for the issuance of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock unit awards, cash-based awards and performance shares to employees, officers and directors of, and consultants to, the Company in such amounts and with such terms and conditions as may be determined by the compensation committee of the Company’s board of directors, subject to the provisions of the 2018 Plan, as applicable.
On May 31, 2024, the Company’s shareholders approved an amended version of the then-current version of the 2018 Plan that served to, among other things, increase the number of ordinary shares authorized for issuance thereunder by 
6.3
 million. At December 31, 2024, there were 
17.9
 million ordinary shares available for issuance in the aggregate under the 2018 Plan. The 2018 Plan provides that awards other than stock options will be counted against the total number of shares available under the plan in a 
1.8
-to-1 ratio.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized share-based compensation expense related to certain performance-based RSUs that were granted during 2021. As of December 31, 2023, the financial performance criteria for these awards were deemed not probable of being achieved; however, in February 2024, the compensation committee of the Company’s board of directors determined that the Company partially achieved the financial performance criteria. This was considered a modification in accordance with FASB ASC 718, 
Compensation—Stock Compensation
 and resulted in a modification charge of approximately $
6.8
 million. In February 2024
, the compensation committee of the Company’s board of directors also determined that the Company achieved the pipeline performance criteria for these awards, resulting in a $
2.6
 million incremental share-based compensation expense, as it was deemed such pipeline performance criteria had been met. The share-based compensation expense related to these achievements was recognized in 2024.

16. COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has entered into several collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize products and, in connection with such arrangements, to access technologies, financial, marketing, manufacturing and other resources. Refer to the “Patents and Proprietary Rights” section in “Item 1— Business” of this Annual Report for information with respect to IP protection for these products. The collaboration revenue the Company has earned in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is summarized in Note 4, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
within the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.

The Company’s significant collaborative arrangements are described below:
Janssen
INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION, INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA and INVEGA HAFYERA/BYANNLI
Under an exclusive license agreement with Janssen, the Company provided Janssen with rights to, and know-how, training and technical assistance in respect of, the Company’s small particle pharmaceutical compound technology, known as NanoCrystal technology, which was used to develop the long-acting INVEGA products, and the Company received milestone payments from Janssen upon the achievement of certain development goals from Janssen; there are no further milestones to be earned under this agreement. The agreement also provides for tiered royalty payments, which consist of a patent royalty and a know-how royalty, both of which are determined on a country-by-country basis. The patent royalty, which equals 
1.5
% of net sales, is payable in each country until the expiration of the last of the patents with valid claims applicable to the product in such country. The know-how royalty is a tiered royalty of 
3.5
%, 
5.5
% and 
7.5
% on aggregate worldwide net sales of below $
250
 million, between $
250
 million and $
500
 million, and greater than $
500
 million, respectively. The know-how royalty rate resets to 
3.5
% at the beginning of each calendar year and is payable until 
15 years
 from first commercial sale of a product in each individual country, subject to expiry of the agreement. These royalty payments may be reduced in any country based on patent litigation or on competing products achieving certain minimum sales thresholds. The license agreement, unless earlier terminated, terminates upon the expiration of the last of the patents subject to the agreement. After expiration, Janssen retains a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to develop, manufacture and commercialize the products, subject to certain surviving obligations. Janssen may terminate the license agreement in whole or in part upon three months’ notice to the Company. The Company and Janssen have the right to terminate the agreement upon a material breach of the other party, which is not cured within a certain time period, or upon the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency.
In November 2021, the Company received notice from Janssen of partial termination of the license agreement, following which Janssen ceased paying the Company royalties related to U.S. sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA, INVEGA TRINZA and INVEGA HAFYERA. In April 2022, the Company commenced binding arbitration proceedings related to, among other things, Janssen’s partial termination of this license agreement and Janssen’s royalty and other obligations under the agreement. In May 2023, the Tribunal in the arbitration proceedings issued a Final Award that served to reinstate the Janssen royalties and required payment by Janssen of back royalties and interest for amounts owed but not yet paid since the effective date of the partial termination. The Final Award also provided, among other things, that the Company was entitled to royalty revenues from Janssen related to net sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA through August 20, 2024, INVEGA TRINZA through the second quarter of 2030 (but no later than May 2030 when the license agreement expires) and INVEGA HAFYERA through May 2030 (when the license agreement expires).
RISPERDAL CONSTA
Under a product development agreement, the Company collaborated with Janssen on the development of RISPERDAL CONSTA. Under the development agreement, Janssen provided funding to the Company for the development of RISPERDAL CONSTA and Janssen is responsible for securing all necessary regulatory approvals for the product.

F-

ALKERMES PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Under 
two
 license agreements, the Company granted Janssen and an affiliate of Janssen exclusive worldwide licenses to use and sell RISPERDAL CONSTA. Under its license agreements with Janssen, the Company receives royalty payments equal to 
2.5
% of Janssen’s end-market net sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA in each country where the license is in effect based on the quarter when the product is sold by Janssen. This royalty may be reduced in any country based on lack of patent coverage and significant competition from generic versions of the product. Janssen can terminate the license agreements upon 
30 days
’ prior written notice to the Company. Either party may terminate the license agreements by written notice following a breach which continues for 
90 days
 after the delivery of written notice thereof or upon the other party’s insolvency. The licenses granted to Janssen expire on a country-by-country basis upon the later of: (i) the expiration of the last patent claiming the product in such country; or (ii) 
15 years
 after the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country, provided that in no event will the license granted to Janssen expire later than the twentieth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in each such country, with the exception of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom, in each case where the fifteen-year minimum shall pertain regardless. After expiration, Janssen retains a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to manufacture, use and sell RISPERDAL CONSTA.

The Company exclusively manufactures RISPERDAL CONSTA at its Wilmington, Ohio facility for commercial sale. Under its manufacturing and supply agreement with Janssen, the Company records manufacturing revenues when product is fully manufactured and approved for shipment by both Janssen and the Company. Revenue is based on a percentage of Janssen’s net unit sales price for RISPERDAL CONSTA for the applicable calendar year. This percentage is determined based on Janssen’s unit demand for such calendar year and varies based on the volume of units shipped, with a minimum manufacturing fee of 
7.5
%. Either party may terminate the manufacturing and supply agreement upon a material breach by the other party, which is not resolved within 
60 days
 after receipt of a written notice specifying the material breach or upon written notice in the event of the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy. Janssen may terminate the agreement upon 
six months
’ written notice to the Company. In the event that Janssen terminates the manufacturing and supply agreement without terminating the license agreements, the royalty rate payable to the Company on Janssen’s net sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA would increase from 
2.5
% to 
5.0
%.
Biogen
Under a license and collaboration agreement with Biogen, the Company granted Biogen a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license to develop, manufacture and commercialize VUMERITY and other products covered by patents licensed to Biogen under the agreement.

Under this license and collaboration agreement, the Company received an upfront cash payment and milestone payments related to the achievement of certain milestones. The Company is also eligible to receive additional payments upon achievement of certain milestones, including milestones relating to the first two products, other than VUMERITY, covered by patents licensed to Biogen under the license and collaboration agreement.
In addition, the Company receives a 
15
% royalty on worldwide net sales of VUMERITY, subject to increases for VUMERITY manufactured and/or packaged by Biogen or its designees. The Company is also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of products other than VUMERITY covered by patents licensed to Biogen under the license and collaboration agreement, at tiered royalty rates calculated as percentages of net sales ranging from high-single digits to sub-teen double digits. All royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) the last-to-expire patent right covering the applicable product in the applicable country and (ii) a specified period of time from the first commercial sale of the applicable product in the applicable country. Royalties for all products are subject to customary reductions, as set forth in the license and collaboration agreement.
Following FDA approval of VUMERITY and, except for the manufacturing responsibilities discussed below, Biogen is now responsible for all development and commercialization activities for VUMERITY and all other products covered by the patents that we licensed to Biogen.
Under the license and collaboration agreement, Biogen appointed the Company as the toll manufacturer of clinical and commercial supplies of VUMERITY, subject to Biogen’s right to manufacture or have manufactured commercial supplies as a back-up manufacturer. In October 2019, the Company entered into a commercial supply agreement with Biogen for the commercial supply of VUMERITY, an amendment to such commercial supply agreement and an amendment to the license and collaboration agreement with Biogen, pursuant to which Biogen has conducted a technology transfer and, following an agreed transition period, has elected to assume responsibility for the manufacture (itself or through a designee) of clinical and commercial supplies of VUMERITY in exchange for an increase in the royalty rate to be paid by Biogen to the Company on net sales of product that is manufactured by Biogen or its designee. In May 2024, the Company completed the sale of the Athlone Facility where VUMERITY is manufactured. In connection with the sale of the Athlone Facility, the Company has entered into a subcontracting arrangement with the purchaser of the Athlone Facility for the manufacture of VUMERITY through the manufacturing transition period, which may continue through the end of 2025.

Unless earlier terminated, the license and collaboration agreement will remain in effect until the expiry of all royalty obligations. Biogen has the right to terminate the license and collaboration agreement at will, on a product-by-product basis or in its entirety upon 180 days’ prior notice to the Company. Either party has the right to terminate the license and collaboration agreement following any governmental prohibition of the transactions effected by the agreement, or in connection with an insolvency event involving the other party. Upon termination of the license and collaboration agreement by either party, then, at the Company’s request, the VUMERITY program will revert to the Company.

Prior period amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Separation.
The income tax provision in 2024 was primarily due to taxes on income earned in Ireland. The income tax benefit in 2023 was primarily due to the partial release of the valuation allowance maintained against certain Irish deferred tax assets, partially offset by taxes on income earned in the U.S. and Ireland. The income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to taxes on income earned in the U.S.
In December 2022, the EU implemented a new corporate minimum tax rate of 
15
% on companies with consolidated annual revenue of at least €
750.0
 million, which was transposed into Irish law effective as of January 1, 2024.  The Company has determined that this new minimum tax had no material impact for the year ended December 31, 2024.
The income tax benefit associated with the Company’s former oncology business, and the tax impact of the Separation, are discussed in further detail in Note 3, 
Discontinued Operations, 
in these “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in this Annual Report. The tax benefits included within discontinued operations were $
0.7
 million, $
1.4
 million, and $
11.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
No provision for income tax has been provided on undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in the foreign operations. Cumulative unremitted earnings of U.S. subsidiaries totaled approximately $
933.5
 million at December 31, 2024. In the event of a repatriation of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be liable for income taxes, subject to adjustment, if any, for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes payable to foreign tax authorities. The Company estimates that approximately $
72.0
 million of income taxes would be payable on the repatriation of the unremitted earnings to Ireland.

(1)
Inclusive of continuing and discontinued operations for the periods prior to the Separation in November 2023.
(2)
(Additions) reductions represent continuing and discontinued operations for the periods prior to the Separation in November 2023. The reductions during the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily relate to the abandonment of certain Irish NOLs following the sale of the Athlone Facility to Novo. These NOLs were transferred from Elan Corporation, plc as part of the combination of the drug technology business of Elan Corporation, plc with the business of Alkermes, Inc. A number of restrictions applied to these NOLs thereby restricting the Company’s ability to utilize such NOLs. Following the sale of the Athlone Facility, the Company believes that its ability to utilize these NOLs is remote. The reduction during the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily relates to the partial release of the valuation allowance maintained by the Company against certain Irish net deferred tax assets. The additions in 2022 relate primarily to Irish NOLs.
The Company regularly assesses the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. In making such assessment, the Company considers both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2024, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of $
29.6
 million against certain U.S. state deferred tax assets and $
50.1
 million against certain Irish deferred tax assets, as the Company has determined that it is more-likely-than-not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized and some may be abandoned.
If the Company incurs losses in the U.S. or in Ireland in the future, or fails to achieve sufficient profitability in a timely manner, the evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets could change and a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets may be required in part or in whole. The Company will continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
393.9
 million of Irish NOL carryforwards, $
14.1
 million of U.S. federal NOL carryforwards, $
43.2
 million of state NOL carryforwards and $
34.0
 million of state tax credits which will either expire on various dates through 2039 or can be carried forward indefinitely. These loss and credit carryforwards are available to reduce certain future Irish and foreign taxable income and tax. These loss and credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the appropriate taxing authorities and may be subject to limitations based upon changes in the ownership of the Company’s ordinary shares. Included within these loss and credit carryforwards are $
14.1
 million of U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and $
5.8
 million of state NOL carryforwards, acquired as part of the acquisition of Rodin Therapeutics, Inc. in November 2019, each of which are subject to a $
0.5
 million annual limitation.

The Company’s major taxing jurisdictions include Ireland and the U.S. (federal and state). These jurisdictions have varying statutes of limitations. In the U.S., the 2021 through 2024 fiscal years remain subject to examination by the respective tax authorities, however, some states have longer statutes of limitations and additional fiscal years remain subject to examination. In Ireland, the 2020 through 2024 fiscal years remain subject to examination by the Irish tax authorities. Additionally, because of the Company’s Irish and U.S. loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards, certain tax returns from fiscal years 2002 onward may also be examined. These years generally remain open for 
three
 to 
four years
 after the loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards have been utilized.

Litigation
From time to time, the Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company would accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to claims and litigation, accruals are based on the Company’s best estimates, utilizing all available information. On a periodic basis, as additional information becomes available, or based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, the Company may reassess the potential liability related to these matters and may revise these estimates, which could result in material adverse adjustments to the Company’s operating results. At December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 potential material losses from claims, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceedings that the Company determined were probable of occurring.
INVEGA TRINZA ANDA Litigation
In September 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutica, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Janssen Research & Development, LLC initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the NJ District Court against Mylan Labs, Mylan, and Mylan Institutional LLC following the filing by Mylan Labs of an ANDA seeking approval from the FDA to market a generic version of INVEGA TRINZA before the expiration of U.S. Patent No. 10,143,693 (the “’693 Patent”). Requested judicial remedies include recovery of litigation costs and injunctive relief. In May 2023, the NJ District Court issued an opinion in favor of the Janssen entities on the issues of infringement and validity of the ’693 Patent and the Mylan entities filed a notice of appeal of the decision. The Company is not a party to this proceeding.
VUMERITY ANDA Litigation
In July 2023, Biogen Inc., Biogen Swiss Manufacturing GmbH and Alkermes Pharma Ireland Limited filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the DE District Court against Zydus Worldwide DMCC, Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. and Zydus Lifesciences Limited (collectively, “Zydus”) following the filing by Zydus of an ANDA seeking approval from the FDA to engage in the commercial manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of VUMERITY (diroximel fumarate) delayed-release capsules for oral use, 231 mg, before expiration of the Company’s U.S. Patent Nos. 8,669,281; 9,090,558; and 10,080,733. The filing of the lawsuit triggered a stay of FDA approval of the ANDA for up to 30 months in accordance with the U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”). A bench trial is scheduled to begin on July 28, 2025.

Government Matters
The Company has received a subpoena and civil investigative demands from U.S. state and federal governmental authorities for documents related to VIVITROL. The Company is cooperating with the investigations.
Product Liability and Other Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to its normal business activities, including a product liability case alleging that the FDA-approved VIVITROL labeling was inadequate and that VIVITROL caused the individual to suffer from opioid overdose and death. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters.
In addition, in January 2023, Acorda filed a petition with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “NY Southern District Court”) asking the court to confirm in part and modify in part the final arbitral award rendered by an arbitration panel in October 2022 and, as part of the requested modification, seeking an additional approximately $
66.0
 million in damages. In August 2023, the NY Southern District Court confirmed the final arbitral award and declined to modify the final award to increase the damages awarded thereunder. In September 2023, Acorda filed a notice of appeal of the NY Southern District Court decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit Court”), and the Company filed a motion to transfer the appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In January 2024, the Federal Circuit Court denied without prejudice the Company’s motion to transfer the appeal and instructed the parties to brief the jurisdictional question as part of the merits appeal. Briefing in the Federal Circuit Court is complete, and the matter is pending decision.
