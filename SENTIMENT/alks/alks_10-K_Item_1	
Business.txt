Proprietary Products

We have developed and now commercialize products designed to help address the unmet needs of people living with opioid dependence, alcohol dependence, schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. See the section entitled “
Patents and Proprietary Rights
” in “Item 1—Business” in this Annual Report for information with respect to the IP protection for our proprietary products.

ARISTADA and ARISTADA INITIO

ARISTADA (aripiprazole lauroxil) is an extended-release intramuscular injectable suspension approved in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia. ARISTADA utilizes our proprietary LinkeRx technology. ARISTADA is a prodrug; once in the body, ARISTADA is likely converted by enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole, which is then hydrolyzed to aripiprazole. ARISTADA is available in four dose strengths with once-monthly dosing options (441 mg, 662 mg and 882 mg), a six-week dosing option (882 mg) and a two-month dosing option (1064 mg). ARISTADA is packaged in a ready-to-use, pre-filled syringe product format. We exclusively manufacture and commercialize ARISTADA in the U.S.

ARISTADA INITIO (aripiprazole lauroxil) leverages our proprietary LinkeRx and NanoCrystal technologies and provides an extended-release formulation of aripiprazole lauroxil in a smaller particle size compared to ARISTADA, thereby enabling faster dissolution and more rapid achievement of relevant levels of aripiprazole in the body. ARISTADA INITIO, combined with a single 30 mg dose of oral aripiprazole, is indicated for the initiation of ARISTADA when used for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. The first ARISTADA dose may be administered on the same day as the ARISTADA INITIO regimen or up to 10 days thereafter. We exclusively manufacture and commercialize ARISTADA INITIO in the U.S.

8

In December 2024, U.S. Patent No. 12,180,164 relating to ARISTADA and ARISTADA INITIO was granted. The patent has claims to the metabolite N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole and expires in 2030.

What is schizophrenia?

Schizophrenia is a serious brain disorder marked by positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions, disorganized speech and thoughts, and agitated or repeated movements) and negative symptoms (depression, blunted emotions and social withdrawal). Schizophrenia affects approximately 1.1% of the U.S. population.

LYBALVI

LYBALVI (olanzapine and samidorphan) is a once-daily, oral atypical antipsychotic drug approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and for the treatment of adults with bipolar I disorder, as a maintenance monotherapy or for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes, as monotherapy or an adjunct to lithium or valproate. LYBALVI is a combination of olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, and samidorphan, an opioid antagonist, in a single bilayer tablet. LYBALVI is available in fixed dosage strengths composed of 10 mg of samidorphan and 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg or 20 mg of olanzapine. We exclusively manufacture and commercialize LYBALVI in the U.S.

In January 2025, U.S. Patent No. 12,194,035 relating to LYBALVI was granted. The patent has claims to methods of treatment that cover LYBALVI and expires in 2031.

What is schizophrenia?

See the disease state description in the section entitled “
ARISTADA and ARISTADA INITIO
” in “Item 1—Business” in this Annual Report.

What is bipolar I disorder?

Bipolar disorder is a brain disorder that is marked by extreme changes in a person’s mood, energy and ability to function. Individuals with this brain disorder may experience debilitating mood states, including extreme highs (mania) and extreme lows (depression). Bipolar I disorder is characterized by the occurrence of at least one manic episode, with or without the occurrence of a major depressive episode, and affects approximately 1% of the adult population in the U.S. in any given year.

VIVITROL

VIVITROL (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) is a once-monthly, non-narcotic, injectable medication approved in the U.S. for the treatment of alcohol dependence in patients able to abstain from alcohol in an outpatient setting prior to initiation of treatment with VIVITROL and for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. VIVITROL uses our polymer-based microsphere injectable extended-release technology to deliver and maintain therapeutic medication levels in the body through one intramuscular injection every four weeks. We exclusively manufacture and commercialize VIVITROL in the U.S.

What are opioid dependence and alcohol dependence?

Opioid dependence is a serious and chronic brain disease characterized by compulsive, prolonged self-administration of opioid substances that are not used for a medical purpose. According to the 2023 U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an estimated 5.4 million people aged 18 or older in the U.S. had an opioid use disorder* in the prior year. Alcohol dependence is a serious and chronic brain disease characterized by cravings for alcohol, loss of control over drinking, withdrawal symptoms and an increased tolerance for alcohol. According to the 2023 U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an estimated 28.1 million people aged 18 or older in the U.S. had an alcohol use disorder* in the prior year. Adherence to medication is particularly challenging with these disease states.

*

In 2013, with the publication of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (“DSM”) 5, the DSM-IV diagnoses of substance use disorders as either dependence or abuse (i.e., opioid dependence or alcohol dependence), which reflects the approved indications of VIVITROL, were subsumed under a new diagnostic category of “substance use disorders” (i.e., opioid use disorder or alcohol use disorder) with three categories of disorder severity—mild, moderate or severe. In determining the applicability of treatments for DSM-IV conditions to persons diagnosed according to DSM-5, one study found agreement between the DSM-IV diagnoses of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence and moderate to severe alcohol use disorder and opioid use disorder, respectively, under DSM-5.

Symptoms may include extreme fatigue, impaired vision, problems with balance and walking, numbness or pain and other sensory changes, bladder and bowel symptoms, tremors, problems with memory and concentration and mood changes, among others.

Approximately 2.5 million people worldwide have MS, and most are diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 50.

Key Development Program

Our R&D is focused on the development of innovative medicines in the field of neuroscience that are designed to address unmet patient needs. As part of our ongoing R&D efforts, we have devoted, and will continue to devote, significant resources to conducting preclinical work and clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products. The discussion below highlights our current key development program. Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and the status, timing and scope of our development programs are subject to change. Important factors that could adversely affect our drug development efforts are discussed in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this Annual Report. See the section entitled “
Patents and Proprietary Rights
” in “Item 1—Business” in this Annual Report for information with respect to the IP protection for our key development program.

ALKS 2680

ALKS 2680 is a novel, investigational, oral, selective orexin 2 receptor agonist in development as a once-daily treatment for narcolepsy type 1, narcolepsy type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia. Orexin, a neuropeptide produced in the lateral hypothalamus, is considered to be the master regulator of wakefulness due to its activation of multiple, downstream wake-promoting pathways that project widely throughout the brain. Targeting the orexin system may address excessive daytime sleepiness across hypersomnolence disorders, whether or not deficient orexin signaling is the underlying cause of disease. Once-daily oral administration of ALKS 2680 was previously evaluated in a phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and patients with narcolepsy type 1, narcolepsy type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia and is currently being evaluated in two phase 2 studies: Vibrance-1 in patients with narcolepsy type 1 and Vibrance-2 in patients with narcolepsy type 2. We expect to initiate Vibrance-3, a phase 2 study in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, in the first half of 2025.

Collaborative Arrangements

We have entered into several collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize products and, in connection with such arrangements, to access or provide access to, technological, financial, marketing, manufacturing and other resources, including the arrangements described below.

Janssen

INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION, INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA and INVEGA HAFYERA/BYANNLI

Under an exclusive license agreement with Janssen, we provided Janssen with rights to, and know-how, training and technical assistance in respect of, our small particle pharmaceutical compound technology, known as NanoCrystal technology, which was used to develop the long-acting INVEGA products, and we received milestone payments from Janssen upon the achievement of certain development goals. There are no further milestones to be earned under this agreement. The agreement also provides for royalty

11

payments, which consist of a patent royalty and a know-how royalty, both of which are determined on a country-by-country basis. The patent royalty, which equals 1.5% of net sales, is payable in each country until the expiration of the last of the patents with valid claims applicable to the product in such country. The know-how royalty is a tiered royalty of 3.5% on calendar year net sales up to $250 million; 5.5% on calendar year net sales of between $250 million and $500 million; and 7.5% on calendar year net sales exceeding $500 million. The know-how royalty rate resets to 3.5% at the beginning of each calendar year and is payable until 15 years from the first commercial sale of a product in each individual country, subject to expiry of the agreement. These royalty payments may be reduced in any country based on patent litigation or on competing products achieving certain minimum sales thresholds. The license agreement, unless earlier terminated, terminates upon the expiration of the last of the patents subject to the agreement. After expiration, Janssen retains a non-exclusive, royalty free license to develop, manufacture and commercialize the products subject to certain surviving obligations.

Janssen may terminate the license agreement in whole or in part upon three months’ notice to us. We and Janssen have the right to terminate the agreement upon a material breach of the other party which is not cured within a certain time period, or upon the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. In November 2021, we received notice from Janssen of partial termination of the license agreement, following which Janssen ceased paying us royalties related to U.S. sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA, INVEGA TRINZA and INVEGA HAFYERA. In April 2022, we commenced binding arbitration proceedings related to, among other things, Janssen’s partial termination of this license agreement and Janssen’s royalty and other obligations under the agreement. In May 2023, the arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”) in the arbitration proceedings issued a final award (the “Final Award”) that served to reinstate the Janssen royalties and required payment by Janssen of back royalties and interest for amounts owed but not yet paid since the effective date of the partial termination. The Final Award also provided, among other things, that we were entitled to royalty revenues from Janssen related to net sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA through August 20, 2024, INVEGA TRINZA through the second quarter of 2030 (but no later than May 2030 when the license agreement expires) and INVEGA HAFYERA through May 2030 (when the license agreement expires).

RISPERDAL CONSTA

Under a product development agreement, we collaborated with Janssen on the development of RISPERDAL CONSTA. Under the development agreement, Janssen provided funding to us for the development of RISPERDAL CONSTA, and Janssen is responsible for securing all necessary regulatory approvals for the product.

Under two license agreements, we granted Janssen and an affiliate of Janssen exclusive worldwide licenses to use and sell RISPERDAL CONSTA. Under our license agreements with Janssen, we receive royalty payments equal to 2.5% of Janssen’s end-market net sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA in each country where the license is in effect based on the quarter when the product is sold by Janssen. This royalty may be reduced in any country based on lack of patent coverage and significant competition from generic versions of the product. Janssen can terminate the license agreements upon 30 days’ prior written notice to us. Either party may terminate the license agreements by written notice following a breach which continues for 90 days after the delivery of written notice thereof or upon the other party’s insolvency. The licenses granted to Janssen expire on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) the expiration of the last patent claiming the product in such country or (ii) 15 years after the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country, provided that in no event will the license granted to Janssen expire later than the twentieth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in each such country, with the exception of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain and the United Kingdom, in each case, where the 15-year minimum shall pertain regardless. After expiration, Janssen retains a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to manufacture, use and sell RISPERDAL CONSTA.

We exclusively manufacture RISPERDAL CONSTA at our Wilmington, Ohio facility for commercial sale. Under our manufacturing and supply agreement with Janssen, we receive manufacturing revenue based on a percentage of Janssen’s net unit sales price for RISPERDAL CONSTA for the applicable calendar year. This percentage is determined based on Janssen’s unit demand for such calendar year and varies based on the volume of units shipped, with a minimum manufacturing fee of 7.5%. Either party may terminate the manufacturing and supply agreement upon a material breach by the other party, which is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of a written notice specifying the material breach or upon written notice in the event of the other party’s insolvency or bankruptcy. Janssen may terminate the agreement upon six months’ written notice to us. In the event that Janssen terminates the manufacturing and supply agreement without terminating the license agreements, the royalty rate payable to us on Janssen’s net sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA would increase from 2.5% to 5.0%.

Revenues from our collaborative arrangements with Janssen accounted for approximately 17%, 31% and 15% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

12

Biogen

Under a license and collaboration agreement with Biogen, we granted Biogen a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license to develop, manufacture and commercialize VUMERITY and other products covered by patents licensed to Biogen under that agreement.

Under this license and collaboration agreement, we received an upfront cash payment and milestone payments related to the achievement of certain milestones. We are also eligible to receive additional payments upon achievement of certain milestones, including milestones relating to the first two products other than VUMERITY covered by patents licensed to Biogen under the license and collaboration agreement.

In addition, we receive a 15% royalty, subject to increases for VUMERITY manufactured and/or packaged by Biogen or its designees, on worldwide net sales of VUMERITY. We are also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of products other than VUMERITY covered by patents licensed to Biogen under the license and collaboration agreement, at tiered royalty rates calculated as percentages of net sales ranging from high-single digits to sub-teen double digits. All royalties are payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) the last-to-expire patent right covering the applicable product in the applicable country and (ii) a specified period of time from the first commercial sale of the applicable product in the applicable country. Royalties for all products are subject to customary reductions, as set forth in the license and collaboration agreement.

Following FDA approval of VUMERITY and except for the manufacturing responsibilities discussed below, Biogen is now responsible for all development and commercialization activities for VUMERITY and all other products covered by the patents that we licensed to Biogen.

Under the license and collaboration agreement, Biogen appointed us as the toll manufacturer of clinical and commercial supplies of VUMERITY, subject to Biogen’s right to manufacture or have manufactured commercial supplies as a back-up manufacturer. In October 2019, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Biogen for the commercial supply of VUMERITY, an amendment to such commercial supply agreement and an amendment to the license and collaboration agreement with Biogen, pursuant to which Biogen has conducted a technology transfer and, following an agreed manufacturing transition period, has elected to assume responsibility for the manufacture (itself or through a designee) of clinical and commercial supplies of VUMERITY in exchange for an increase in the royalty rate to be paid by Biogen to us on net sales of product that is manufactured by Biogen or its designee. In May 2024, we completed the sale of our research and development business and manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland (the “Athlone Facility”) where VUMERITY is manufactured. In connection with the sale of the Athlone Facility, we have entered into a subcontracting arrangement with the purchaser of the Athlone Facility for the manufacture of VUMERITY through the manufacturing transition period, which may continue through the end of 2025.

Unless earlier terminated, the license and collaboration agreement will remain in effect until the expiry of all royalty obligations. Biogen has the right to terminate the license and collaboration agreement at will, on a product-by-product basis or in its entirety upon 180 days’ prior notice to us. Either party has the right to terminate the license and collaboration agreement following any governmental prohibition of the transactions effected by the agreement, or in connection with an insolvency event involving the other party. Upon termination of the license and collaboration agreement by either party, then, at our request, the VUMERITY program will revert to us.

Revenues from Biogen related to this license and collaboration agreement accounted for approximately 9%, 8% and 10% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Proprietary Technology Platforms

We have used our proprietary technology platforms, which include technologies owned and exclusively licensed to us, to establish drug development, clinical development and regulatory expertise and in the development of our products.

Injectable Extended-Release Microsphere Technology

Our injectable extended-release microsphere technology allows us to encapsulate small-molecule pharmaceuticals, peptides and proteins in microspheres made of common medical polymers. The technology is designed to enable novel formulations of pharmaceuticals by providing controlled, extended release of drugs over time. Drug release from the microsphere is controlled by diffusion of the drug through the microsphere and by biodegradation of the polymer. These processes can be modulated through a number of formulation and fabrication variables, including drug substance and microsphere particle sizing and choice of polymers and excipients.

13

LinkeRx Technology

Our long-acting LinkeRx technology platform is designed to enable the creation of extended-release injectable versions of antipsychotic therapies and may also be useful in other disease areas in which extended duration of action may provide therapeutic benefits. The technology uses proprietary linker-tail chemistry to create new molecular entities derived from known agents.

NanoCrystal Technology

Our NanoCrystal technology is applicable to poorly water-soluble compounds and involves formulating and stabilizing drugs into particles that are nanometers in size. A drug in NanoCrystal form can be incorporated into a range of common dosage forms, including tablets, capsules, inhalation devices and sterile forms for injection, with the potential for enhanced oral bioavailability, increased therapeutic effectiveness, reduced/eliminated fed/fasted variability and sustained duration of intravenous/intramuscular release.

Oral Controlled Release Technology

Our oral controlled release (“OCR”) technologies are used to formulate, develop and manufacture oral dosage forms of pharmaceutical products with varied drug release profiles.

Manufacturing and Product Supply

We own and occupy a manufacturing facility in Wilmington, Ohio. We either purchase active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) from third parties or receive it from our third-party licensees to manufacture products using our technologies. The manufacture of our products for clinical trials and commercial use is subject to Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations and other regulations. Our manufacturing and development capabilities include formulation through process development, scale-up and full-scale commercial manufacturing and specialized capabilities for the development and manufacture of controlled substances.

Although some materials and related services for our products are currently only available from a single source or a limited number of qualified sources, we attempt to acquire an adequate inventory of such materials, establish alternative sources for such materials and related services and/or negotiate long-term supply arrangements. However, we cannot be certain that we will continue to be able to obtain long-term supplies of our manufacturing materials or long-term provision of related services.

Our supply chain includes an external network of third-party service providers involved in the manufacture of our products whose manufacturing facilities and processes are, like ours, subject to inspection by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the acquisition of API, raw materials, or components, or in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging, or storage of our marketed or development products, including as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection, could significantly impair our ability to manufacture and market our products or advance our development efforts, as the case may be.

In May 2024, we completed the sale of our Athlone Facility and related business to Novo Nordisk (“Novo”) and entered into subcontracting arrangements to continue certain development and manufacturing activities performed at the Athlone Facility for a period of time after the closing of the transaction, which may continue through the end of 2025. For information about risks relating to the manufacture of our marketed products and product candidates, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this Annual Report and specifically those sections entitled “We rely on third parties to provide goods and services in connection with the manufacture and distribution of the products we manufacture” and “We are subject to risks related to the manufacture of our products.”

Marketed Products

We manufacture ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO, LYBALVI, VIVITROL and microspheres for RISPERDAL CONSTA at our Wilmington, Ohio facility. We outsource our packaging operations for ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO, LYBALVI and VIVITROL to third-party contractors. Janssen is responsible for packaging operations for RISPERDAL CONSTA. Our Wilmington, Ohio facility has been inspected by U.S., European (including the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency), Chinese, Japanese, Brazilian, Turkish, Russian and Saudi Arabian regulatory authorities for compliance with required cGMP standards for continued commercial manufacturing. For more information about our Wilmington, Ohio manufacturing facility, see “Item 2—Properties” in this Annual Report.

We have entered into subcontracting arrangements for the manufacture of several products in the Athlone Facility that are marketed by third parties, including VUMERITY. This facility has been inspected by regulatory authorities of numerous jurisdictions for compliance with required cGMP standards for continued commercial manufacturing.

14

Clinical Products

We manufacture clinical supplies of injectable extended-release products and solid dosage form products at our Wilmington, Ohio facility. We have also contracted with third-party manufacturers to formulate certain products for clinical use. We require that our contract manufacturers adhere to cGMP in the manufacture of our products or components of our products for clinical use.

Research & Development

We devote significant resources to R&D programs. We focus our R&D efforts on developing novel therapeutics in areas of high unmet medical need. Our R&D efforts include, but are not limited to, areas such as pharmaceutical formulation, analytical chemistry, process development, engineering, scale-up and drug optimization/delivery. Please see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report for additional information relating to our R&D expenditures.

Permits and Regulatory Approvals

We hold various permits, registrations, approvals and/or licenses in respect of our manufacturing and related activities. The primary licenses held in this regard are FDA Registrations of Drug Establishment, and licenses from the Drug Enforcement Administration of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DEA”). We also hold various authorizations, licenses and certificates from the Health Products Regulatory Authority in Ireland, including an Investigational Medicinal Products Manufacturers Authorization (No. IMP074/00002) and a Manufacturers Authorization (No. M13297/00001) in respect of our offices located in Dublin, Ireland, and a Manufacturers Authorization (No. M13297/00002), in respect of the Athlone Facility, pending completion of updates to applicable product filings. We also hold current GMP certificates associated with each of these authorizations. Due to certain U.S. state law requirements, we also hold state licenses to cover distribution activities conducted in certain states where required. Additional Manufacturer Authorizations that we previously held in respect of the Athlone Facility were transferred to Novo with the sale of the facility and related business in May 2024.

We do not generally act as the marketing authorization holder for products incorporating our technologies that have been developed on behalf of a licensee of such technologies. In such cases, our licensee usually holds the relevant marketing authorization from the FDA or other relevant regulatory authority, and we support this authorization as needed, including by furnishing a copy of the product’s Drug Master File, or chemistry, manufacturing and controls data, to the relevant regulator. We generally update this information annually with the relevant regulator. In other cases where we have developed proprietary products, such as VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI, we hold the marketing authorization and related regulatory documentation ourselves.

Marketing, Sales and Distribution

We are responsible for the marketing of VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO, and LYBALVI in the U.S. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on physicians in private practice and in public treatment systems. We believe that we use customary pharmaceutical company practices to market our products, including through advertisements, professional symposia, selling initiatives and other methods, and to educate individual physicians, nurses, social workers, counselors and other stakeholders involved in the treatment of opioid dependence, alcohol dependence, schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. We provide, and contract with third-party vendors to provide, customer services and other related programs for our products, such as product-specific websites, insurance research services and order, delivery and fulfillment services.

Our sales force for VIVITROL in the U.S. consisted of approximately 105 individuals as of December 31, 2024. VIVITROL is primarily sold to pharmaceutical wholesalers, pharmacies, specialty distributors and treatment providers. Product sales of VIVITROL during the year ended December 31, 2024 to McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health and Cencora, Inc. (formerly known as Amerisource Bergen, “Cencora”) represented approximately 34%, 21% and 16%, respectively, of total VIVITROL gross sales.

Our sales force for ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI in the U.S. consisted of approximately 355 individuals as of December 31, 2024.

Under our license agreements with Janssen, Biogen and other licensees and sublicensees, the licensees and sublicensees are typically responsible for the commercialization of any products developed under their respective agreements if and when regulatory approval is obtained.

Competition

We face intense competition in the development, manufacture, marketing and commercialization of our products from many and varied sources, such as research institutions and biopharmaceutical companies, including other companies with similar technologies. Some of these competitors are also our licensees, who control the commercialization of products from which we receive manufacturing and/or royalty revenues. In some cases, these competitors may be working to develop and market other products, systems, or other methods of preventing or reducing disease, or new small-molecule or other classes of drugs.

The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intensive research, development and commercialization efforts and rapid and significant technological change. In many cases, there are already products on the market that may be in direct competition with our commercial products or products in development. In addition, there are many companies developing products for use in similar indications or with similar technologies to ours with whom we and our licensees compete, many of whom are larger and have significantly greater financial, operational and other resources than we do. Other smaller or earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, whether through focused or more abbreviated development programs, or collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Some of the products being developed by our competitors are being designed to work differently than our products and may prove to be safer or more effective than our products or achieve regulatory approval and be commercialized earlier than our products, which may render our products or technology platforms obsolete or noncompetitive or make it more challenging for us to commercialize our products. With respect to our products, we believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things, the existence of competing or alternative products in the marketplace, including generic competition, and the relative price of those products; the efficacy, safety and reliability of our products compared to competing or alternative products; product acceptance by, and preferences of, physicians, other healthcare providers and patients; our ability to comply with applicable laws, regulations and regulatory requirements with respect to the manufacture and/or commercialization of our products, including any changes or increases to regulatory restrictions; protection of our proprietary rights relating to our products; our ability to obtain reimbursement for our products; our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our products, and the timing and scope of any such regulatory approvals; our ability to successfully manufacture and provide a reliable supply of commercial quantities of a product to the market; and our ability to recruit, retain and develop skilled employees.

With respect to our proprietary injectable product platform, we are aware that there are other companies developing extended-release delivery systems for pharmaceutical products, including but not limited to technology from Pharmathen S.A., which underpins aripiprazole formulations in development, and technology underpinning Teva’s once every two weeks injectable microsphere formulation, each for the treatment of schizophrenia. In the treatment of schizophrenia, ARISTADA, the long-acting INVEGA products and RISPERDAL CONSTA compete with each other and a number of other injectable products, including ZYPREXA RELPREVV ((olanzapine) For Extended Release Injectable Suspension), which is marketed and sold by Lilly; ABILIFY MAINTENA (aripiprazole for extended release injectable suspension), a once-monthly injectable formulation of ABILIFY (aripiprazole) developed by Otsuka Pharm. Co.; ABILIFY ASIMTUFII (aripiprazole), a once-every-two-months injectable formulation of ABILIFY (aripiprazole) developed by Otsuka Pharm. Co.; PERSERIS (risperidone for extended release injectable suspension), a once-monthly formulation of risperidone marketed by Indivior plc; RYKINDO (risperidone), a once-every-two-weeks injectable formulation of risperidone developed by Luye Pharma Group; UZEDY (risperidone) extended-release injectable suspension, for subcutaneous use, developed and marketed by MedinCell S.A. and Teva; and generic versions of branded injectable products.

In the treatment of schizophrenia, LYBALVI competes with other oral antipsychotic products, including CAPLYTA (lumateperone) developed and marketed by Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc.; REXULTI (brexpiprazole), which is co-marketed by Otsuka Pharm Co. and H. Lundbeck A/S plc; VRAYLAR (cariprazine), which is marketed and sold by Abbvie Inc.; COBENFY (xanomeline and trospium chloride), which is marketed and sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; other oral compounds currently on the market; and generic versions of branded oral products. Other pharmaceutical companies are developing products for the treatment of schizophrenia that, if approved by the FDA, would compete with LYBALVI.

In the treatment of bipolar I disorder, LYBALVI and RISPERDAL CONSTA compete with antipsychotics such as oral aripiprazole; VRAYLAR; ABILIFY MAINTENA; ABILIFY ASIMTUFII; CAPLYTA; RYKINDO; risperidone; quetiapine; olanzapine; and ziprasidone. Other pharmaceutical companies are developing products for the treatment of bipolar I disorder that, if approved by the FDA, would compete with LYBALVI.

16

In the treatment of alcohol dependence, VIVITROL competes with generic acamprosate calcium (also known as CAMPRAL) and generic disulfiram (also known as ANTABUSE) as well as currently marketed drugs, including generic drugs, also formulated from naltrexone. Other pharmaceutical companies are developing products that have shown some potential in treating alcohol dependence that, if approved by the FDA, would compete with VIVITROL.

In the treatment of opioid dependence, VIVITROL competes with SUBOXONE (buprenorphine HCl/naloxone HCl dehydrate sublingual tablets), SUBOXONE (buprenorphine/naloxone) Sublingual Film, SUBUTEX (buprenorphine HCl sublingual tablets) and SUBLOCADE (once-monthly buprenorphine extended-release injection), each of which is marketed and sold by Indivior plc; BUNAVAIL buccal film (buprenorphine and naloxone) marketed by BioDelivery Sciences; ZUBSOLV (buprenorphine and naloxone) marketed by Orexo US, Inc.; and BRIXADI (buprenorphine) extended-release injection for subcutaneous use (CIII), marketed by Braeburn Inc. VIVITROL also competes with methadone, oral naltrexone and generic versions of SUBUTEX and SUBOXONE sublingual tablets. Other pharmaceutical companies are developing products that have shown potential in treating opioid dependence that, if approved by the FDA, would compete with VIVITROL.

In the treatment of MS, VUMERITY competes with AVONEX (interferon beta-1a), TYSABRI (natalizumab), TECFIDERA (dimethyl fumarate), and PLEGRIDY (peginterferon beta-1a) from Biogen; OCREVUS (ocrelizumab) from Genentech; BETASERON (interferon beta-1b) from Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals; COPAXONE (glatiramer acetate) from Teva; REBIF (interferon beta-1a) and MAVENCLAD (cladribine) from EMD Serono, Inc.; GILENYA (fingolimod), EXTAVIA (interferon beta-1b) and MAYZENT (siponimod) from Novartis AG; AUBAGIO (teriflunomide) and LEMTRADA (alemtuzumab) from Sanofi-Aventis; ZEPOSIA (ozanimod) from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; PONVORY (ponesimod) from Janssen; and BRIUMVI (ublituximab-xiiy) from TG Therapeutics, Inc.

With respect to our NanoCrystal technology, we are aware that other technology approaches similarly address poorly water-soluble drugs. These approaches include nanoparticles, cyclodextrins, lipid-based self-emulsifying drug delivery systems, dendrimers and micelles, among others, any of which could limit the potential success and growth prospects of products incorporating our NanoCrystal technology. In addition, there are many competing technologies to our OCR technology, some of which are owned by large pharmaceutical companies with drug delivery divisions or other, smaller drug-delivery-specific companies.

Patents and Proprietary Rights

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, including those marketed and sold by our licensees, to maintain trade secret protection and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We have a proprietary portfolio of patent rights and exclusive licenses to patents and patent applications, which includes numerous patents in the U.S. and in other countries directed to compositions of matter, methods of treatment and formulations, and processes of preparation. In the future, we plan to file additional patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries directed to new or improved products and processes, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend our patent positions. In addition, our licensees may own additional patents that cover those products from which we receive royalties.

Protection of Proprietary Rights and Competitive Position

We have exclusive rights through licensing agreements with third parties to issued U.S. patents, pending patent applications and corresponding patents or patent applications in countries outside the U.S, subject in certain instances to the rights of the U.S. government to use the technology covered by such patents and patent applications. Under certain licensing agreements, we are responsible for patent expenses, and we pay annual license fees and/or minimum annual royalties. In addition, under these licensing agreements, we are typically obligated to pay royalties on future sales of products, if any, covered by the licensed patents.

19

There may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our products or technologies. The manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or import of some of our products might be found to infringe on the claims of these patents. A third party might file an infringement action against us. The cost of defending such an action is likely to be high, and we might not receive a favorable ruling. There may also be patent applications filed by third parties that relate to some of our products if issued in their present form. The patent laws of the U.S. and other countries are distinct, and decisions as to patenting, validity of patents and infringement of patents may be resolved differently in different countries.

If patents exist or are issued that cover our products or technologies, we or our licensees may not be able to manufacture, use, offer for sale, sell or import some of our products without first getting a license from the patent holder. The patent holder may not grant us a license on reasonable terms, or it may refuse to grant us a license at all. This could delay or prevent us from developing, manufacturing, selling or importing those of our products that would require the license.

We try to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and in other countries related to our proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. Because the patent position of biopharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions, enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. The ultimate degree of patent protection that will be afforded to products and processes, including ours, in the U.S. and in other important markets, remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may not provide any protection against competitors. Our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. If issued, such patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed outside the scope of our patents. The laws of certain countries do not protect our IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.

We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and inventions, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to such information, such as our corporate partners, collaborators, licensees, employees and consultants. However, any of these parties may breach such agreements and may disclose our confidential information or our competitors might learn of the information in some other way. If any trade secret, know-how or other invention not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, such event could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. For more information, see “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.

Our trademarks, including VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI, are important to us and are generally covered by trademark applications or registrations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) and the patent or trademark offices of other countries. Our licensed products and products using our proprietary technologies also use trademarks that are owned by our licensees, such as the trademarks for INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION, INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA, INVEGA HAFYERA/BYANNLI and RISPERDAL CONSTA, which are registered trademarks of Johnson & Johnson or its affiliated companies and VUMERITY, which is a registered trademark of Biogen (and used by us under license). Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law and continues in some countries as long as the trademark is used and in other countries as long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms.

Regulatory

Regulation of Pharmaceutical Products

United States

Our current and contemplated activities, and the products and processes that result from such activities, are subject to substantial government regulation. Before new pharmaceutical products may be sold in the U.S., preclinical studies and clinical trials of the products must be conducted and the results submitted to the FDA for approval. Clinical trial programs must determine an appropriate dose and regimen, establish substantial evidence of effectiveness and define the conditions for safe use. This is a high-risk process that requires stepwise clinical studies in which the product must successfully meet pre-specified endpoints.

Preclinical Testing
: Before beginning testing of any compounds with potential therapeutic value in human subjects in the U.S., stringent government requirements for preclinical data must be satisfied. Preclinical testing includes both in vitro, or in an artificial environment outside of a living organism, and in vivo, or within a living organism, laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation.

20

Investigational New Drug Application
: All available data from animal pharmacology and toxicology studies are included in an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) submitted to the FDA and are reviewed by the FDA prior to commencement of first-in-human clinical trials. The preclinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical studies in human subjects. In certain cases where human clinical data from ex-U.S. studies are available prior to submitting the IND, these data would also be included in the IND for review by the FDA prior to commencing clinical trials in the U.S. In addition, information pertaining to the composition, manufacturer, stability, and controls used for manufacturing the drug substance and the drug product are included in the IND to support identification, quality, purity, and strength of the investigational drug product.

Clinical Trials
: Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator pursuant to an FDA-reviewed protocol. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another and, depending upon the nature of the clinical program, a specific phase or phases may be skipped altogether. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the applicable IND.

•
Phase 1 clinical trials—test for safety, tolerability, absorption, bio-distribution, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology and, if possible, to gain early evidence regarding efficacy.

•
Phase 2 clinical trials—involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population and seek to assess the efficacy of the drug for targeted indications, to determine dose-response and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to the safety profile.

•
Phase 3 clinical trials—consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain definitive statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the proposed product and dosing regimen.

In the U.S., the results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a product are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or a Biologics License Application (“BLA”), depending on the nature of the product. The NDA or BLA also include information pertaining to the chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) of the product as well as the proposed product packaging and labeling. The submission of an application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file the application if it is not considered sufficiently complete to permit a review and will inform the applicant of the reason for the refusal. The applicant may then resubmit the application and include supplemental information.

Once an NDA or BLA is accepted for filing, the FDA has 10 months, under its standard review process, within which to review the application (for some applications, the review process is longer than 10 months). For drugs that, if approved, would represent a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications, the FDA may assign “priority review” designation and review the application within six months of filing. The FDA has additional review pathways to expedite development and review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs, including: “Fast Track,” “Breakthrough Therapy,” and “Accelerated Approval.” However, none of these expedited pathways ensure that a product will receive FDA approval in a timely manner or at all.

As part of its review, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for independent advice on questions related to the development of the drug, recommendation as to whether the application should be approved or other guidance that the FDA may seek. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee; however, historically, it has often followed such recommendations. The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks. If required, a REMS may include various elements, such as publication of a medication guide, a patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to support the safe use of the drug.

In reviewing an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, or issue a complete response letter to communicate to the applicant the reasons the application cannot be approved in its then-current form and provide input on the additional information that the FDA requires and/or changes that must be made before an application can be approved. Even if such additional information is submitted to the FDA or such changes made, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA still does not satisfy the FDA’s criteria for approval. The receipt of regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, efficacy and potential safety signals observed in preclinical tests or clinical trials, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. It is impossible to predict with any certainty whether and when the FDA will grant marketing approval for a given product. Even if a product is approved, the approval may be subject to limitations based on the FDA’s interpretation of the data. For example, the FDA may require, as a condition of approval, restricted distribution and use, enhanced labeling, special packaging or

21

labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials or restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, any of which could negatively impact the commercial success of a drug. The FDA may also require a sponsor to conduct additional post-marketing studies as a condition of approval to provide data on safety and effectiveness. In addition, prior to commercialization, products that may be deemed controlled substances are subject to review and scheduling by the DEA.

The FDA tracks information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval. Non-compliance with safety reporting requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties. Side effects or adverse events that are identified during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent marketing approval. Based on new safety information that emerges after approval, the FDA can mandate product labeling changes, impose a REMS or the addition of elements to an existing REMS, require new post-marketing studies (including additional clinical trials), or suspend or withdraw approval of the product.

If we seek to make certain types of changes to an approved product, such as adding a new indication, making certain manufacturing changes, or changing manufacturers or suppliers of certain ingredients or components, the FDA will need to review and approve such changes in advance. In the case of adding a new indication, we would be required to demonstrate with additional clinical data that the product is safe and effective for the new intended use. Such regulatory reviews can result in denial or modification of the planned changes, or requirements to conduct additional tests or evaluations that can substantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes.

In addition, the FDA regulates all advertising and promotional activities for products under its jurisdiction. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are consistent with FDA regulation and guidance, and the product’s approved label. However, physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling. Such off-label uses are common across certain medical specialties and often reflect a physician’s belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for a particular patient. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but the FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice, corrective advertising and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice.

Controlled Substances Act
: The DEA regulates pharmaceutical products that are controlled substances. Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of the five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”). The CSA governs, among other things, the inventory, distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. For example, pharmaceutical products that act on the CNS are often evaluated for abuse potential; if a product is then classified as a controlled substance, it must undergo scheduling by the DEA, which is a separate process that may delay the commercial launch of such product even after FDA approval of the NDA for such product. Further, companies with a scheduled pharmaceutical product are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess ongoing compliance with the DEA’s regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation, or a denial of renewal, of any DEA registration and injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.

Outside the United States

Certain of our products are commercialized by our licensees in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Most of these jurisdictions have product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. In Europe, there are several mechanisms for marketing approval, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a company submits a single application to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). The marketing application is evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), the expert scientific committee of the EMA. If the CHMP determines that the marketing application fulfills the requirements for quality, safety, and efficacy, it will submit a favorable opinion to the European Commission (“EC”). The CHMP opinion is not binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. A marketing application approved by the EC is valid in all EU member states.

In addition to the centralized procedure, Europe also has: (i) a nationalized procedure, which requires a separate application to, and approval determination by, each country; (ii) a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval; and (iii) a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants submit an application to one country for review and other countries may accept or reject the initial decision. Regardless of the approval process employed, various parties share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection and evaluation of adverse events post-approval, including national authorities, the EMA, the EC, other relevant regulatory authorities and the marketing authorization holder.

Good Manufacturing Practices

The FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the EU member states and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products prior to approving a product. Once approval from a regulatory agency is obtained, if a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process,

22

additional regulatory review and approval may be required. Companies also must adhere to cGMP and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies both in the manufacture of clinical product and following product approval. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following the initial approval of a product and may also request that certain information or records be provided in writing for review in lieu of an on-site visit. If, as a result of these inspections or records reviews, it is determined that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations.

Good Clinical Practices

The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies promulgate regulations and standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), for designing, conducting, monitoring, auditing and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, trial sites, contract research organizations (“CROs”) and institutional review boards. If our studies fail to comply with applicable GCP, patient safety and well-being could be impacted, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and relevant regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Noncompliance can also result in civil or criminal sanctions. We rely on third parties, including CROs, to carry out many of our clinical trial-related activities. Failure of such third parties to comply with GCP can likewise result in rejection of our clinical trial data or other sanctions.

Hatch-Waxman Act

Under the U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”), Congress created an abbreviated FDA review process for generic versions of pioneer, or brand-name, drug products. The law also provides incentives by awarding, in certain circumstances, non-patent related marketing exclusivities to pioneer drug manufacturers. Newly approved drug products and changes to the conditions of use of approved products may benefit from periods of non-patent-related marketing exclusivity in addition to any patent protection the drug product may have. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of new chemical entity (“NCE”) marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a product that contains an active ingredient, known as the active drug moiety, not found in any other approved product. The FDA is prohibited from accepting any abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) for a generic drug or 505(b)(2) application referencing the NCE for five years from the date of approval of the NCE, or four years in the case of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a patent challenge, and in both cases may not approve such generic drug or 505(b)(2) application until expiration of NCE marketing exclusivity. A 505(b)(2) application is an NDA in which the applicant relies, in part, on data and the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Hatch-Waxman Act exclusivities will not prevent the submission or approval of a full NDA (e.g., under 505(b)(1)), as opposed to an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, for any drug, including, for example, a drug with the same active ingredient, dosage form, route of administration, strength and conditions of use.

The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of exclusivity for applications containing the results of new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, essential to the FDA’s approval of new uses of approved products, such as new indications, dosage forms, strengths, or conditions of use. However, this exclusivity only protects against the approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications for the protected use and will not prohibit the FDA from accepting or approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for other products containing the same active ingredient.

The Hatch-Waxman Act requires NDA applicants and NDA holders to provide certain information about patents related to the drug for listing in the FDA’s Approved Drugs Product List, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. ANDA and 505(b)(2) applicants must then certify regarding each of the patents listed with the FDA for the reference product. A certification that a listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the marketing of the applicant’s product is called a “Paragraph IV certification.” If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant provides such a notification of patent invalidity or noninfringement, then the FDA may accept the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application four years after approval of the NDA for an NCE. If a Paragraph IV certification is filed and the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted as a reviewable filing by the FDA, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant must then, within 20 days, provide notice to the NDA holder and patent owner stating that the application has been submitted and providing the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s opinion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. The NDA holder or patent owner may file suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement. If this is done within 45 days of receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, a one-time, 30-month stay of the FDA’s ability to approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is triggered. The 30-month stay begins at the end of the NDA holder’s data exclusivity period, or, if data exclusivity has expired, on the date that the patent holder is notified. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed, or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation.

23

Orphan Drug Act

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate drugs or biologics for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. FDA grants orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is one that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the product and making it available in the U.S. for the disease or condition will be recovered from U.S. sales of the product. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review process or lower the approval standards, but can provide important benefits, including consultation with the FDA. If a product is approved for its orphan designated use, it may be entitled to Orphan Drug Exclusivity (“ODE”), which blocks the FDA from approving for seven years any other application for a product that is the same drug for the same indication. ODE does not prevent approval of another sponsor’s application for different indications or uses of the same drug, or for different drugs for the same indication.

Sales and Marketing

We are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the broad scope of the U.S. statutory provisions, the general absence of guidance in the form of regulations, and few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In addition, federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the U.S. government under the False Claims Act. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors” in this Annual Report and specifically those sections entitled “If there are changes in, or we fail to comply with, the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the healthcare industry, we could be subject to investigations, litigation, costs, penalties and business losses,” “Revenues generated by sales of our products depend, in part, on the availability from third-party payers of reimbursement for our products and the extent of cost-sharing arrangements for patients (e.g., patient co-payment, co-insurance, deductible obligations) and cost-control measures imposed, and any reductions in payment rate or reimbursement or increases in our or in patients’ financial obligation to payers could result in decreased sales of our products and/or decreased revenues” and “The clinical study or commercial use of our products may cause unintended side effects or adverse reactions, or incidents of misuse may occur, which could adversely affect our products, business and share price.”

Laws and regulations have been enacted by the U.S. federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers and require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include federal “sunshine”, or open payments, provisions enacted in 2010 as part of the comprehensive federal healthcare reform legislation and supplemented as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act. Such provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments made to, or at the request of, or on behalf of, physicians or to teaching hospitals and certain payments made to physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives. Certain state laws also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Given the ambiguity found in many of these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent U.S. federal and state laws and regulations.

Pricing and Reimbursement

United States

In the U.S., sales of our products, including those sold by our licensees, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales are dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of reimbursement from third-party payers such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products, in addition to their safety and efficacy.

24

Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low-income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law as the greater of 23.1% of average manufacturer price (“AMP”) or the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any commercial or non-federal governmental customer. The rebate amount must be adjusted upward where the AMP for a product’s first full quarter of sales, when adjusted for increases in the Consumer Price Index—Urban, is less than the AMP for the current quarter, with this difference being the amount by which the rebate is adjusted upwards. The rebate amount is required to be recomputed each quarter based on our report of current AMP and best price for each of our products to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The terms of our participation in the rebate program impose a requirement on us to report revisions to AMP or best price within a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data was originally due. Any such revisions could have the impact of increasing or decreasing our rebate liability for prior quarters, depending on the direction of the revision. In addition, if we were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties per item of false information in addition to other penalties available to the government.

Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part B pays physicians who administer our products under a payment methodology using average sales price (“ASP”) information. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide ASP information to CMS on a quarterly basis. This information is used to compute Medicare payment rates, with rates for Medicare Part B drugs outside the hospital outpatient setting and in the hospital outpatient setting consisting of ASP plus a specified percentage. These rates are adjusted periodically. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties for each misrepresentation and for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied.

Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician) and certain physician-administered drugs reimbursed under a pharmacy benefit. Medicare Part D also covers the prescription drug benefit for dual eligible beneficiaries. Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. The Medicare Part D benefit has distinct phases, where the share of drug costs paid by Medicare Part D enrollees, the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, drug manufacturers and Medicare varies. Prior to 2025, the phases consisted of the deductible phase, the initial coverage phase, the coverage gap and the catastrophic coverage phase and, except for dual eligible Medicare Part D beneficiaries who qualified for low-income subsidies, drug manufacturers, including us, were required to provide a seventy percent (70%) discount on our brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reached the coverage gap in their drug benefits. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Inflation Reduction Act”) made substantial changes to the Medicare Part D benefit design and replaced the manufacturer coverage-gap discount program with a new manufacturer discount program that took effect in January 2025. Under the new discount program, the Medicare Part D benefit phases consist of the deductible phase, the coverage phase and the catastrophic coverage phase, and drug manufacturers must provide a ten percent (10%) discount on their brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the initial coverage phase and a twenty percent (20%) discount during the catastrophic coverage phase. For manufacturers that meet the definition of a “specified manufacturer,” the Inflation Reduction Act provides for Medicare Part D discounts to be phased in over time, starting with a one percent (1%) discount in the initial coverage phase and a one percent (1%) discount in the catastrophic coverage phase in 2025. These discount amounts increase each year, stepping up to a ten percent (10%) discount in the initial coverage phase in 2029 and a twenty percent (20%) discount in the catastrophic coverage phase in 2031. Alkermes meets the criteria of a “specified manufacturer” and, therefore, will follow the phase-in schedule for discounts to the Medicare Part D program.

Federal law also requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (“MDRP”) also participate in the Public Health Services’ (including the Indian Health Services, “PHS”) pharmaceutical pricing program (the “340B program”), in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered drugs. These 340B covered entities include certain qualifying community health clinics, a variety of entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, and multiple categories of hospitals, including children’s hospitals, critical access hospitals, free standing cancer hospitals and hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the MDRP. A regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities became effective on January 1, 2019. The scope and implementation of the 340B program continue to be the subject of legislative and regulatory interest and ongoing litigation, the outcomes of which are difficult to predict.

25

We also make our products available for purchase by authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) of the General Services Administration pursuant to our FSS contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (the “VHC Act”), we are required to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing to four federal agencies: the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Defense; the Coast Guard; and the PHS, in order for federal funding to be made available for reimbursement of any of our products by such federal agencies and certain federal grantees. Coverage under Medicaid, the Medicare Part B program and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is also conditioned upon FSS participation. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that we charge our most-favored, non-federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy (“Tricare”) program), Coast Guard and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76% of the non-federal average manufacturer price (“non-FAMP”). An additional discount applies if non-FAMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index—Urban). In addition, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the VHC Act provides for civil monetary penalties per false item of information in addition to other penalties available to the government.

In addition, in January 2016, CMS released the final Medicaid covered outpatient drug regulation, which became effective in April 2016. This regulation implements those changes made by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”) to the Medicaid drug rebate statute in 2010 and addresses a number of other issues with respect to the Medicaid program, including, but not limited to, the eligibility and calculation methodologies for AMP and best price, and the expansion of Medicaid rebate liability to include Medicaid managed care organizations. The final Medicaid covered outpatient drug regulation established two calculation methodologies for AMP: one for drugs generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies (“RCP”) and one for so-called “5i drugs” (inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injectable drugs) “not generally dispensed” through RCPs. The regulation further made clear that 5i drugs would qualify as “not generally dispensed” and, therefore, able to use the alternative AMP calculation, if not more than thirty percent (30%) of their sales were to RCPs or to wholesalers for RCPs. The primary difference between the two AMP calculations is the requirement to include in AMP, for those qualifying 5i drugs not generally dispensed through RCPs, certain payments, rebates and discounts related to sales to non-RCPs; such inclusion often leads to a lower AMP. The decision of which AMP calculation a product is eligible to use must be made and applied on a monthly basis based on the percentage of sales of such product to RCPs or to wholesalers for RCPs.

In September 2024, CMS released a final rule titled “Medicaid Program: Misclassification of Drugs, Program Administration and Program Integrity Updates Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program,” the provisions of which generally took effect in November 2024. The rule includes several provisions affecting manufacturers that participate in the MDRP, including, but not limited to, addressing manufacturer misclassification of their products in reports required by the MDRP, imposing a 12-quarter deadline for manufacturer disputes or audits of state rebate invoices, and modifying the definition of “covered outpatient drugs” for which manufacturers are required to pay rebates to include certain drugs administered in inpatient settings where the drug is part of an inclusive payment, such inclusive payment includes an amount attributable to the drug and the number of units of the drug administered to the patient, and where the amount paid that is attributable to the drug is based on a reimbursement methodology included in the applicable state plan.

U.S. federal and state governments regularly consider reforming healthcare coverage and lessening healthcare costs. Such reforms may include price controls, value-based pricing and changes to the coverage and reimbursement of our products, which may have a significant impact on our business. In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes several provisions that will impact our business to varying degrees, including those that impose new manufacturer financial liability on all drugs in Medicare Part D beginning in 2025, allow the U.S. government to negotiate prices for some drugs covered under Medicare Part D beginning in 2026 and Medicare Part B beginning in 2028, and require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for drug prices that increase faster than inflation. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Private insurers regularly seek to manage drug cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations through means including, but not limited to, formularies, increased out of pocket obligations and various prior authorization requirements. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we have received regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

Outside the United States

Within the EU, products are paid for by a variety of payers, with governments being the primary source of payment. Governments may determine or influence reimbursement of products. Governments may also set prices or otherwise regulate pricing. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization of products. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). Recent budgetary pressures in many EU countries are causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates, and expanded generic substitution and patient cost-sharing. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures.

26

Other Regulations

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
: We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and its Irish equivalent, which prohibits corporations and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, authorizing, or making payments of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the healthcare professionals with whom we regularly interact may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.

Environmental, Health and Safety Laws
: Our operations are subject to complex and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and, in particular, where we have manufacturing facilities, namely the U.S. and Ireland. Environmental and health and safety authorities in the relevant jurisdictions, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the U.S. and the Environmental Protection Agency and the Health and Safety Authority in Ireland, administer laws which regulate, among other matters, the emission of pollutants into the air (including the workplace), the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water, the storage, use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, the exposure of persons to hazardous substances, and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. In certain cases, these laws and regulations may impose strict liability for pollution of the environment and contamination resulting from spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances or waste and/or any migration of such hazardous substances or waste. Costs, damages and/or fines may result from the presence, investigation and remediation of contamination at properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us and/or off-site locations, including where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances or waste. In addition, we may be subject to third-party claims, including for natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage, in connection with such contamination.

The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)
:

The GDPR became effective in May 2018 and replaced the previous EU Data Protection Directive (95/46). The GDPR, which governs the processing of personal data (including personal health data), applies to the Company and any of its subsidiaries that are established in the EU to the extent that they process personal data as well as any of its subsidiaries that are established outside the EU to the extent that they process personal data relating to EU residents for certain purposes, including any such data relating to clinical trial participants in the EU. The GDPR imposes significant obligations on controllers and processors of personal data, including high standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, robust notification requirements to individuals about the processing of their personal data, a strong individual data rights regime, mandatory data breach notifications, limitations on the retention of personal data, stringent requirements pertaining to health data, and strict rules and restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, including to the U.S. The GDPR also imposes additional obligations on, and required contractual provisions to be included in, contracts between companies subject to the GDPR and their third-party processors that relate to the processing of personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations in order to introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data.

Other Laws
: We are subject to a variety of financial disclosures, securities trading regulations and U.S. and Irish or EU governmental regulations as an Irish-incorporated company publicly-listed in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC, the Irish Companies Act 2014, and the regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”), on which our shares are traded. We are also subject to various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and environmental matters, including disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work.

Human Capital Resources

As a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative medicines in the field of neuroscience, we have built, and continue to devote significant resources to further develop and enhance, a comprehensive cross-functional infrastructure designed to support product development from discovery through commercialization and lifecycle management. We seek to attract, hire, develop, recognize and retain qualified and highly skilled employees with experience in areas such as R&D, including early discovery, medicinal chemistry, translational medicine, formulation development, and clinical trials operations capabilities; IP prosecution, enforcement and defense; medical affairs; manufacturing operations; U.S. federal and state government affairs; sales and marketing; and market access, among other areas. Competition for such personnel in our industry and the geographic regions in which we operate is intense, with numerous companies also developing, launching or marketing products, including products against which our products directly compete. We are committed to supporting our employees’ well-being in a transparent, diverse, inclusive, and collaborative environment and to providing them with access to training, support and resources intended to help them succeed professionally, while balancing their professional and personal lives.

27

As of February 7, 2025, we had approximately 1,800 full time employees, of which approximately 1,700 were based in the U.S. and 100 were based in Ireland. Our 2024 global voluntary attrition rate of 9.6% was below industry benchmarks. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

We are an equal opportunity employer and fundamentally committed to creating and maintaining a work environment in which employees are treated with respect and dignity. All human resources policies, practices and actions related to hiring, promotion, compensation, benefits and termination are administered in accordance with the principles of equal employment opportunity and other legitimate criteria without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, age, mental or physical disability, genetic information, any veteran status, any military status or application for military service, or membership in any other category protected under applicable laws.

In recognition of the value of our employees and their important contributions to the achievement of our business objectives, we offer market-competitive comprehensive total rewards packages, including bonus opportunities at all levels tied to individual and company performance, and for employees at certain levels, company equity opportunities. We are committed to designing and managing our pay programs and decisions to support equitable pay for all employees. We have established our compensation programs based on market and benchmark data and strive to pay all employees equitably, taking into consideration factors such as their role, skills, abilities and relevant experience. We routinely monitor our pay programs in order to respond to market trends and maintain equity within our workforce. We offer our employees healthcare and retirement savings plan benefits, paid time off, tuition reimbursement and other benefits designed to support healthy lifestyle choices, financial well-being and work-life balance.

In support of our business, we seek to cultivate a work environment that reflects collaboration, respect for each voice, and unwavering commitment, and strengthens the sense of belonging among our employees. Reflecting the needs of our employees, we have established a global steering committee, comprised of representatives from all of our locations (including field-based employees), focused on creating connections, fostering conversations, and helping to support alignment of our efforts across the range of perspectives within our organization. We have collaborated with our employees to create five employee resource groups, or ERGs: Limitless, a network to support people impacted by disability or illness; MOSAIC, a multicultural network; Operation Salute, a network to support active duty military members, veterans and their families; Pride@Work, an LGBTQ+ and allies network; and Women Inspired Network (WIN), a women’s network. These ERGs, which are open to all employees, share a common purpose of supporting and enhancing the inclusiveness of our company culture and providing opportunities for professional development, networking, learning and building deeper connections within Alkermes.

We encourage active employee engagement to help ensure that employees feel part of our mission and that they have a voice in the Alkermes community. Since 2017, we have conducted periodic employee engagement surveys to understand employee sentiment regarding, and satisfaction with, their work and experience at Alkermes, and have used, and plan to continue to use, the data collected to help inform and evolve our human capital management strategy and initiatives. We survey employees at least annually, which allows our employees to share their insights on a regular basis and provides us with opportunities to regularly assess and address employee feedback. As many of our office-based employees have adapted to a hybrid work model, we have continued to implement our expanded employee communications strategies to keep all employees connected and informed.

We are committed to the professional growth and development of our employees. We conduct a comprehensive on-boarding experience that connects newly hired employees to our business, values, culture, and people. We encourage and support our employees in their adoption of Individual Development Plans designed to identify professional development and growth opportunities to help support their career aspirations. We frequently offer Company-hosted trainings that cover topics including performance management, problem-solving, leadership development, diversity, communication and mentorship, and as appropriate, more specialized skills-based programs. We also provide all employees access to our LinkedIn Learning platform, which provides on-demand learning opportunities.

We ask our employees to help us promote and sustain workplace environments that are safe, productive and protective of the health and well-being of our people and in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. We maintain extensive corporate environmental, health, safety and security policies, adhere to all health and safety standards set by regulators in the locations in which we operate, and routinely assess workplace risks, conduct employee trainings and monitor our sites to reduce the risk of workplace accidents. In 2024, employee health, safety and wellness continued to be of particular focus and importance for the Company.

Item 1
A. Risk
 Factors

You should consider carefully the risks described below in addition to the financial and other information contained in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and related notes thereto and the matters addressed under the caption “Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” and in our other public filings with the SEC. If any events described by the following risks actually occur, such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. This could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to materially decline.
 The risks described below are not intended to be exhaustive and are not the only risks that we face. New risk factors can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict the impact that any factor or combination of factors may have on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry

We receive substantial revenue from our key proprietary products and our success depends on our ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize such products.

Sales of our proprietary products comprise a significant portion of our revenues. We developed and exclusively manufacture VIVITROL for the treatment of adults with alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, ARISTADA for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia, ARISTADA INITIO for initiation onto ARISTADA for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia, and LYBALVI for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and for the treatment of adults with bipolar I disorder, and we exclusively commercialize these products in the U.S. Our success depends in large part on our ability to continue to successfully manufacture and commercialize such products in the complex markets into which they are sold. Any significant negative developments relating to these products could have a material adverse effect on our revenues from these products and, in turn, on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and the market price of our ordinary shares.

We face competition in the biopharmaceutical industry.

We face intense competition in the development, manufacture, marketing and commercialization of our products from many and varied sources, such as research institutions and other biopharmaceutical companies, including companies with similar technologies or medicines, and manufacturers of generic drugs. Some of these competitors are also our licensees, who control the commercialization of products from which we receive manufacturing and/or royalty revenues. For example, our proprietary products ARISTADA and LYBALVI compete with the long-acting INVEGA products and RISPERDAL CONSTA, products from which we receive manufacturing and/or royalty revenues.

The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intensive research, development and commercialization efforts and rapid and significant technological change. In many cases, there are already products on the market that may be in direct competition with our commercial products or products in development. In addition, there are many companies with which we and our licensees compete that are developing generic versions of our products, or products with similar technologies to ours or for use in similar indications, and many of these competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial, operational and other resources than we do. Smaller or earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, whether through focused or more abbreviated development programs or collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Some of the products being developed by our competitors are being designed to work differently than our products and may prove to be safer or more effective than our products or achieve regulatory approval and be commercialized earlier than our products, which may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive or make it more challenging for us to successfully commercialize our products. For a detailed discussion of the competition that we face with respect to our current marketed products, technologies and product indications, please see the section entitled “
Competition
” in “Item 1—Business” in this Annual Report. If we are unable to compete successfully in the highly competitive biopharmaceutical industry, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Our revenues from sales of our products may decrease or grow at a slower than expected rate due to many factors.

We cannot be assured that our products will be, or will continue to be, accepted in the U.S. or markets outside the U.S. or that we will be able to maintain or increase sales of our products. Factors that may cause revenues from our products to grow at a slower than expected rate, decrease or cease all together, include, among others:

•
the perception of physicians and other members of the healthcare community as to our products’ safety and efficacy relative to that of current or future competing products and the willingness or ability of physicians and other members of the healthcare community to prescribe, dispense and/or administer, and patients to use, our products;

•
unfavorable publicity concerning us, our licensees, our products, similar classes of drugs or our industry generally;

30

•
the cost-effectiveness of our products and reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers that may impact use of our products; 

•
the cost and availability of raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products; 

•
the successful manufacture of our products on a timely and cost-effective basis; 

•
the size of the markets for our products, and patient and physician satisfaction with our products; 

•
significant changes in the competitive landscape for our products, including any approvals of generic versions of our products or other branded products that may compete with our products;

•
adverse event information relating to our products or to similar classes of drugs; 

•
changes to the product labels of our products, or of products within the same drug classes, to add new significant warnings or restrictions on use; 

•
our ability to engage third parties to manufacture, package and/or distribute our products on acceptable terms, or at all; 

•
the unfavorable outcome of investigations, arbitrations, litigation or other legal proceedings, including government requests for information related to one or more of our products, securities litigation, IP litigation, including so-called “Paragraph IV” litigation relating to products from which we receive revenue, litigation or other proceedings before the USPTO Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the “PTAB”) or its equivalent in other jurisdictions outside of the U.S., and any other litigation or arbitration related to any of our products; 

•
regulatory developments and actions related to the manufacture, commercialization or continued use of our products, including FDA actions such as the issuance of a REMS or warning letter, or conduct of an audit by the FDA or another regulatory authority in which a manufacturing or quality deficiency is identified; 

•
the extent and effectiveness of the sales, marketing and distribution support for our products, including the size of our and our licensees’ sales forces and investments in marketing strategies, and our and our licensees’ decisions as to the timing and volume of product orders and shipments, the timing of product launches, and product pricing and discounting; 

•
disputes with our licensees relating to the use of our technology in, and marketing and sale of, products from which we received, or currently receive, manufacturing and/or royalty revenue and the amounts and duration of payments to be made with respect to such products; 

•
exchange rate valuations and fluctuations; 

•
U.S. and global political and administrative changes, conflicts and/or instability, public health matters, economic conditions and/or any related changes in applicable laws and regulations or federal and state policy efforts, that may impact resources and markets for our products or the systems and environments in which we operate; and

•
any other material adverse developments with respect to the commercialization of our products.

Revenues generated by sales of our products depend, in part, on the availability from third-party payers of reimbursement for our products and the extent of cost-sharing arrangements for patients (e.g., patient co-payment, co-insurance, deductible obligations) and cost-control measures imposed, and any reductions in payment rate or reimbursement or increases in our or in patients’ financial obligation to payers could result in decreased sales of our products and/or decreased revenues.

In both U.S. and non-U.S. markets, sales of our products depend, in part, on adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from third-party payers such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S. and similar programs in other countries, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Deterioration in the timeliness, certainty and amount of reimbursement for our products, the existence of barriers to coverage of our products (such as prior authorization, criteria for use or other requirements), increases in our financial obligation to payers, including government payers, limitations by healthcare providers on how much, or under what circumstances, they will prescribe or administer our products or unwillingness by patients to pay any required co-payments, or deductible amounts, could reduce the use of, and revenues generated from, our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

The availability of government and private reimbursement for our products and coverage restrictions that may be imposed for our products are uncertain, as is the amount for which our products will be reimbursed. Pricing and reimbursement for our products may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in, and implementation of, federal or state government regulations or private third-party payors’ reimbursement policies; pressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs; and consolidation and increasing assertiveness of payors and pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”) seeking price discounts or

31

rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, the imposition of restrictions on access or coverage of particular drugs or pricing determined based on perceived value. We cannot predict the availability, amount, or consistency of reimbursement for, or the prevalence and extent of other access barriers to, our products.

In the U.S., federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-party payers continue to focus on containing the cost of healthcare. The Inflation Reduction Act includes several provisions that will impact our business to varying degrees, including the Drug Price Negotiation Program applicable to Medicare Parts D and B and those provisions that impose new manufacturer financial liability on all drugs in Medicare Part D beginning in 2025, and require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for drug prices that increase faster than inflation. The Drug Price Negotiation Program is subject to ongoing litigation, the outcome of which is difficult to predict.

In addition, economic pressure on state budgets may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for drugs, including but not limited to price control initiatives, discounts and other pricing-related actions. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting that manufacturers pay supplemental rebates and are requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug. Managed care organizations continue to seek price discounts and, in some cases, to impose restrictions on the coverage of particular drugs. U.S. government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for our products.

Furthermore, we may face uncertainties as a result of efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA, the Inflation Reduction Act and other legislation that impacts us, whether by legislative means or through litigation, and further potential reforms to government negotiation or regulation of drug pricing. The PPACA significantly expanded coverage of mental health and substance use disorders and provided federal parity protections to such coverage benefits. If efforts to reform or repeal PPACA, or to implement differently certain of its provisions, are successful, such efforts and proposed legislation or other future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform and drug pricing could adversely affect our business and financial results. Additional discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenue, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Many payors continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients, including more limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pay or co-insurance obligations and limitations on patients' use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs). Significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and pharmacy benefit managers exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage. In addition, pharmacy benefit managers have merged with or acquired specialty and mail order pharmacies and provider groups. This consolidation, and any further consolidation, among insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, other entities in the pharmaceutical supply chain and other payors has increased and will increase, respectively, the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers.

In the U.S., to help patients afford our approved products, we may utilize programs to assist them, including patient assistance programs and co-pay programs for eligible patients. Government enforcement agencies have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical companies' product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. Our payment support programs could become the target of similar actions. In addition, in November 2013, CMS issued guidance to the issuers of qualified health plans sold through the PPACA’s marketplaces encouraging such plans to reject patient cost-sharing support from third parties and indicating that CMS intends to monitor the provision of such support and may take regulatory action to limit it in the future. CMS subsequently issued a rule requiring individual market qualified health plans to accept third-party premium and cost-sharing payments from certain government-related entities. In September 2014, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a Special Advisory Bulletin warning manufacturers that they may be subject to sanctions under the federal anti-kickback statute and/or civil monetary penalty laws if they do not take appropriate steps to exclude Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay programs. It is possible that changes in insurer policies regarding co-pay programs and/or the introduction and enactment of new legislation or regulatory action could restrict or otherwise negatively affect these patient support programs, which could result in fewer patients using affected products, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business, and financial condition.

32

If there are changes in, or we fail to comply with, the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the healthcare industry, we could be subject to investigations, litigation, costs, penalties and business losses.

Our activities, and the activities of our licensees and third-party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, state and local agencies includes detailed inspections of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, marketing and promotion, adverse event reporting, sampling, distribution, recordkeeping, storage, and disposal practices, among others. Achieving and maintaining compliance with these regulations substantially increases the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approvals to market newly developed and existing products. Government regulatory actions, including audits, records requests and inspections of manufacturing facilities, can result in delay in the release of products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the manufacture and sale of products, and other regulatory enforcement actions, including the levying of civil fines or criminal penalties, the issuance of a warning letter, or the imposition of an injunction.

Biopharmaceutical companies have also been the target of government lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible promotion of pharmaceutical products, improper payments intended to influence the referral of healthcare business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations, violations related to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and violations related to environmental matters. We have been, and may continue to be, the subject of certain government inquiries or requests for documentation. For example, we have received a subpoena and civil investigative demands from U.S. state and federal authorities for documents related to VIVITROL, and have cooperated with the government in each instance. If, as a result of government requests, proceedings are initiated, including under the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute or False Claims Act, or under state False Claims Acts or other laws, and we are found to have violated one or more applicable laws, we may be subject to significant liability, including without limitation, civil fines, criminal fines and penalties, civil damages and exclusion from U.S. federal funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could materially affect our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Conduct giving rise to such liability could also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by such conduct. Additionally, regardless of whether or not there is merit to claims underlying any investigation or legal proceedings to which we are subject, or whether or not we are found as a result of such investigations or lawsuits to have violated any applicable laws, such lawsuits and inquiries can be expensive to defend or respond to, may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in managing our business, and may further cause significant and potentially irreparable harm to our public reputation. While we have implemented numerous risk mitigation measures, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our licensees, our consultants or our contractors are, or will be, in compliance with all applicable laws or regulations. If we or our agents fail to comply with any of those laws or regulations, a range of actions could result, including the suspension or termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product, restrictions on sales of our products or our manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation.

Changes affecting the healthcare industry, including new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to patent protection and enforcement, access to healthcare, environmental issues or product pricing and marketing, could also adversely affect our revenues, our public reputation or our potential to be profitable. For example, and as discussed above, the Inflation Reduction Act includes several provisions that will impact our business to varying degrees, including those that impose new manufacturer financial liability on all drugs in Medicare Part D beginning in 2025, allow the U.S. government to negotiate prices for some drugs covered under Medicare Part B and Part D with effect beginning in 2026, and require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for drug prices that increase faster than inflation. Additionally, in its 2024 decision in 
Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo
, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled the “Chevron doctrine,” which gave deference to regulatory agencies’ statutory interpretations in litigation against federal government agencies, such as the FDA, where the law was ambiguous. This U.S. Supreme Court decision may lead to challenges of longstanding decisions and policies of the FDA, and other federal agencies, which could lead to uncertainties in the industry and disrupt or alter such federal agencies’ operations. Any further changes in laws, regulations or decisions or in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and decisions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

We rely heavily on our licensees in the commercialization and continued development of products from which we receive revenue and, if our licensees are not effective, or if disputes arise in respect of our contractual arrangements, our revenues could be materially adversely affected.

Our arrangements with licensees are critical to bringing to market and/or successfully commercializing products using our proprietary technologies and from which we receive manufacturing and/or royalty revenue. We rely on these licensees in various respects, including commercializing such products, conducting development activities with respect to new formulations or new indications for such products, and/or managing the regulatory approval process for such products.

33

We earn significant royalty revenue from sales by our licensees of our licensed products and third-party products incorporating our proprietary technologies. We also earn manufacturing revenues for products that we currently manufacture on behalf of other parties. The revenues we receive from such products depend primarily upon the success of our licensees in commercializing such products. For example, we receive substantial revenue from Janssen’s sales of XEPLION, INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA, INVEGA HAFYERA/BYANNLI and RISPERDAL CONSTA, and from Biogen’s sales of VUMERITY. We have no involvement in the commercialization efforts for these and other products sold by third parties from which we receive revenue and cannot control the extent or effectiveness of such commercialization efforts. In addition, certain of these products are currently subject to ANDA litigation proceedings to which we are not a party and, if such proceedings are not resolved favorably or are settled by our licensees, generic versions of these products could be launched and there may be an adverse impact on the commercialization of these products and therefore on the revenue that we receive from sales of these products.

Disputes may also arise between us and a licensee involving the ownership of technology developed under a license, the use of our technology, including know-how, in third-party products, the terms and amounts of royalty payments to be paid under a license, or other issues arising out of any licenses or other collaborative agreements. Such disputes may delay related development programs, impact commercialization or manufacturing activities for the related products, impact the timing or amount of revenue that we receive in respect of such products, or result in expensive arbitration, litigation or other dispute resolution, which may not be resolved in our favor and may adversely impact our financial condition.

Further, certain of our license agreements may be terminated, with or without cause, or assigned in connection with a change in control or other event, and we cannot guarantee that any of these licensing relationships will continue or that our licensees will be able or willing to continue to perform their obligations, including development, commercialization or payment obligations, under such agreements. Any significant negative developments relating to our relationships with our licensees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and on the market price of our ordinary shares.

For example, in November 2021 we received notice of partial termination of an exclusive license agreement with Janssen. Under this license agreement, we provided Janssen with rights to, and know-how, training and technical assistance in respect of, our small particle pharmaceutical compound technology, known as NanoCrystal technology, which was used to develop INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION, INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA, INVEGA HAFYERA/BYANNLI, and CABENUVA. While we ultimately prevailed in arbitration proceedings related to, among other things, this partial termination and Janssen’s royalty and other obligations under the license agreement, the announcement of the partial termination, expectations regarding the loss of royalty revenues, actual delays in receipt of royalty revenues that resulted from such termination, and the ultimate announcement of the resumption of payment of such royalty revenues, caused the market price of our ordinary shares to fluctuate significantly.

For these and other reasons that may be outside of our control, our revenues from products sold by our licensees, and any related commercial milestone payments, may fall below our expectations, the expectations of our licensees or those of our shareholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the market price of our ordinary shares.

Clinical trials for our products are expensive, may take several years to complete, and their outcomes are uncertain.

In order to obtain regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product, we or our licensees must demonstrate, through preclinical testing and clinical trials, that such product is safe and effective for use in humans. Designing, conducting and completing a clinical development program is often a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process and the risk of a product not successfully completing full clinical development and receiving marketing approval is high. We have incurred, and we will continue to incur, substantial expenses for preclinical testing, clinical trials and other activities related to our clinical development programs.

Our preclinical and clinical development efforts may take several years or more, varying substantially with the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product and the clinical study designs and methodologies employed, and may not be successfully completed in a timely manner or at all. Timelines for the initiation, conduct and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including:

•
issues with the opening, operation or inspection of a new or ongoing clinical trial site, including those located in or near geographic areas of conflict or areas impacted by political, environmental, public health or economic events;

•
delays or failures of third-party CROs and other third-party service providers and clinical investigators to manage and conduct the trials, perform oversight of the trials, including data audit and verification procedures, or to meet expected timelines; 

•
an inability to recruit, enroll and retain clinical trial participants at the expected rate or at all, or to adequately follow participants after treatment; 

•
safety or tolerability issues that may arise during clinical trials; 

•
an inability to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials; and

34

•
unforeseen governmental or regulatory issues or concerns, including those of the FDA and other regulatory agencies, that may impact the strategies for, and design, timelines or feasibility of, our clinical development programs.

In addition, we are currently conducting and enrolling patients in clinical studies in a number of countries where our experience is more limited and in disease areas in which we have not previously conducted clinical trials. In these instances, we must depend on third parties, including independent clinical investigators, CROs and other third-party service providers, to successfully conduct our clinical trials and to audit, verify and accurately report results from such trials. Though we do not have much control over many aspects of such third-party activities, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Third parties may not complete planned activities on schedule or conduct our trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols.

The outcome of our clinical trials is uncertain. The results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials often have not predicted results of later clinical trials. A number of products have shown promising results in early clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and/or efficacy data in later clinical trials to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.

If we and/or third parties fail to manage or conduct clinical trials in a timely manner or in accordance with study protocols or obligations or if a product fails to demonstrate clinical safety and efficacy or to possess features that may give such product a competitive commercial advantage over other products for the same indication, the development, approval and/or commercialization of our products may be delayed or prevented or less successful than anticipated, and such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Preliminary, topline or interim data from our clinical trials that we may announce, publish or report from time to time may change as more patient data become available or based on subsequent audit and verification procedures, and may not be indicative of final data from such trials, data from future trials or real-world results.

From time to time, we may announce, publish or report preliminary, topline or interim data from our clinical trials. Such data are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patients continue progressing through the study, as patient enrollment continues and/or as more patient data become available, and such data may not be indicative of final data from such trials, data from future trials or real-world results. In addition, such data may remain subject to audit confirmation and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary, topline or interim data disclosed. As a result, all preliminary, topline and interim data, and data from early clinical trials with a small number of participants, should be viewed with caution until the final data or more extensive datasets are available, as applicable. Material adverse differences between preliminary, topline or interim data and final data, or initial proof-of-concept data and data from later or larger trials, could significantly harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to successfully obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products.

We must obtain government approvals before marketing or selling our products. The FDA in the U.S., and comparable regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions, impose substantial and rigorous requirements for the development, manufacture and commercialization of medicines, the satisfaction of which can take a significant number of years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product.

In addition, regulation is not static, and regulatory agencies, including the FDA, evolve in their staff, interpretations and practices, including as a result of changes in government, and may impose different or more stringent requirements than currently in effect, which may adversely affect our plans for product development, manufacture and/or commercialization. The approval procedures and the time and requirements necessary to obtain and maintain approvals may also vary among countries. Regulatory agencies may have varying interpretations of the same data, and approval by one regulatory agency does not ensure approval by regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may choose not to communicate with or update us during clinical testing and regulatory review periods and the ultimate decision by the FDA or other regulatory agencies regarding drug approval or post-approval requirements may not be consistent with prior discussions with or communications from such agencies.

The product approval process can last many years, be very costly and still be unsuccessful. Regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies can be delayed, limited or not granted at all for many reasons, including:

•
a product may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy or a sufficiently favorable benefit/risk profile for each target indication in accordance with applicable regulatory agencies’ standards;

•
data from preclinical testing and clinical trials may be interpreted by applicable regulatory agencies in different ways than we or our licensees interpret it; 

35

•
regulatory agencies may not agree with our or our licensees’ regulatory approval strategies, plans for accelerated development timelines, components of our or our licensees’ filings such as clinical trial designs, conduct and methodologies, or the sufficiency of our or our licensees’ submitted data to meet their requirements for product approval; 

•
regulatory agencies might not approve our or our licensees’ manufacturing processes or facilities, or those of the CROs and contract manufacturing organizations who conduct research or manufacturing work on our or our licensees’ behalf; 

•
failure by our clinical investigational sites and the records kept at such sites, including any clinical trial data, to be in compliance with the FDA’s GCP, or EU legislation governing GCP, or to pass FDA, EMA or EU member state inspections of clinical trials; 

•
regulatory agencies may change their requirements for approval or post-approval marketing; and

•
adverse medical events during our clinical trials or during clinical trials of other product candidates in the same class could lead to requirements that trials be repeated or extended, or that a development program be terminated or placed on clinical hold, even if other studies or trials relating to the program are successful.

In addition, disruptions at the FDA and other regulatory agencies that are unrelated to our company or our products, including those relating to a prolonged U.S. government shutdown, or other global, political or economic conditions, could cause delays to the regulatory approval process for our products.

Any failure to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approval for our products will prevent or delay their commercialization and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, any failure to obtain, or delay in obtaining, approval for our products could have a material impact on our shareholders’ confidence in the strength of our development capabilities and/or our ability to generate significant revenue from our development programs and could result in a significant decline in our share price.

Even if regulatory approval to market a product is granted by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, the approved label for the product may not be consistent with our initial expectations or commercial plans. For example, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may impose limitations on the clinical data that may be included in the label for the product or the indicated uses for which, or the manner in which, the product may be marketed, or may impose additional post-approval requirements, such as a REMS, with which we would need to comply in order to maintain the approval of such product. Our business could be seriously harmed if we do not complete these post-approval requirements and, as a result, the FDA or other regulatory agencies require us to change the label for such product, or if such post-approval requirements significantly restrict the marketing, sale or use of such product.

In addition, legislation and regulatory policies relating to post-approval requirements and restrictions on promotional activities for pharmaceutical products, or FDA or other regulatory agency regulations, guidance or interpretations with respect to such legislation or regulatory policy may change, which may impact the development and commercialization of our products.

Disruptions at the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies could negatively impact our business.

Disruptions at the FDA and other regulatory agencies that are unrelated to our company or our products, including due to changes in government, could increase the time required for new drugs to be reviewed and approved, or otherwise cause delays to the regulatory approval or post-approval processes for our products, which could adversely affect our business. The ability of the FDA or other regulatory agencies to review and approve new products or manage post-approval requirements for marketed products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times for product submissions have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely is subject to the impacts of political events, which are inherently fluid and unpredictable.

For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if other global, political or economic conditions impact the regulatory agencies with which we interact, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA and the SEC or other agencies to timely review and process our submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

36

We may not be able to successfully expand our R&D pipeline or our commercial product portfolio, which could limit our growth potential.

Our business is focused on the development and commercialization of medicines in the field of neuroscience, and we invest substantial resources toward the research and development of new potential product candidates to advance into clinical trials. Notwithstanding this investment, our development programs may not yield viable product candidates in a timely manner or at all, and our product candidates may not obtain regulatory approval, which could limit our growth potential.

In addition to our internal development programs, our strategy for pipeline and commercial portfolio expansion includes identifying and evaluating potential transactional opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions, licenses and collaborations, and development and supply, commercialization or co-promotion arrangements, among others, to acquire or license additional products, product candidates, or technologies that could be additive to our business and to our strategy to create value for our shareholders. However, such transactions are highly competitive, and many other companies may pursue the same or similar assets to those that we may consider attractive. In particular, larger companies with greater financial resources or development or commercialization capabilities may have a competitive advantage over us. Furthermore, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We may also be unable to enter into transactions on acceptable terms that would allow us to realize an appropriate return on our investment. Even if we succeed in our efforts to obtain rights to suitable products, product candidates, or technologies, the competitive business environment may result in high transaction costs, and our investment in these potential assets would remain subject to the inherent risks associated with the development and commercialization of new medicines and may not yield the growth or success that we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results and the market price of our ordinary shares.

We are subject to risks related to the manufacture of our products.

The manufacture of pharmaceutical products is a highly complex process in which a variety of difficulties may arise from time to time. We have in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions or delays in manufacturing through our internal or external supply chain and resources. Such disruptions can occur for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the supply and quality of API, drug product and other product components and any potential shortages of such materials; regulatory actions; failures relating to materials, manufacturing equipment or processes, quality deviations or safety issues, vendor error, operator error, labor shortages or disputes, utility or transportation disruptions, or physical or electronic security breaches; site-specific incidents (such as fires), environmental incidents, natural disasters and other severe weather events, including those that may occur as a result of climate change; global disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflicts in various regions of the world; and many other factors.

Any such problems with manufacturing processes, whether at our facilities or those of our licensees or other third parties that manufacture or package products or components of products on our behalf, could result in product defects or shortages, manufacturing failures or products not being manufactured to their applicable specifications, which could require us to delay shipment of products or recall products previously shipped, or could impair our or our licensees’ ability to receive regulatory approval for a product, commercially launch a product, expand into new markets or supply products in existing markets. We may not be able to resolve any such issues in a timely manner, or at all, which could result in declines in sales and reputational damage as well as significant remediation costs to address any issues that arise.

We rely solely on our manufacturing facility in Wilmington, Ohio for the manufacture of VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO, LYBALVI and RISPERDAL CONSTA. Due to regulatory and technical requirements, we have limited ability to shift production within our facility or to outsource any portions of our manufacturing to third parties in the event of an interruption in manufacturing or demand for manufacturing that exceeds our capacity. Any need to transition our manufacturing processes, or portions thereof, to a third party, whether due to an interruption in our manufacturing or due to demand for a product that exceeds our manufacturing capacity or otherwise, could take a significant amount of time and resources, may not be successful, and could cause significant interruption or delay in our ability to supply products.

VUMERITY and other products using our NanoCrystal or OCR technologies are currently manufactured through subcontracting arrangements at the Athlone Facility, which we previously owned and sold to Novo in May 2024. Any interruption or delay in supply from the Athlone Facility, whether resulting from issues with equipment, materials, personnel, manufacturing processes, or internal or external quality audits or reviews, or issues related to the subcontracting arrangements under which these products are manufactured, could result in delays in meeting our contractual obligations and could damage our reputation and relationships with our licensees, and result in potential loss of revenues.

Manufacturing facilities also require specialized personnel and are expensive to operate and maintain. Any interruption in manufacturing, delay in a regulatory approval or commercial launch, or recall or suspension of sales of products manufactured in our facilities, may cause operating losses as we continue to operate our facilities and retain the required specialized personnel. In addition, any significant personnel shortages at our manufacturing facilities or the Athlone Facility, whether temporary or prolonged, including shortages related to the labor market, may cause significant interruptions to our supply of products.

37

We are also dependent in certain cases on third parties who manufacture or distribute certain products from which we receive revenue. Supply or manufacturing issues related to such products could materially and adversely affect sales of such products, and in turn our revenue from such products.

We rely on third parties to provide goods and services in connection with the manufacture and distribution of the products we manufacture.

We rely on third parties for the timely supply of goods and services that play a role in our manufacturing activities, including, among others, specified raw materials, equipment, contract manufacturing, formulation and packaging services, storage and product distribution services, customer service activities and product returns processing, and some of these goods and services for our products are currently only available from a single source or a limited number of qualified sources. Although we actively manage these third-party relationships to support continuity, quality and compliance with applicable regulations, events beyond our control, including natural disasters and other severe weather events, including those that may occur as a result of climate change, or global disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflicts in various regions in the world, could negatively impact the continuity of supply of such materials and/or services, their quality and their compliance with applicable standards. Any such failure could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

The manufacture of products and product components, including the procurement of bulk drug product and other materials used in the manufacture, packaging, storage and distribution of our products, requires successful coordination among us and multiple third-party providers. Lack of capacity available at such third-party providers or any other issues with the quality or operations of these third-party providers, including any issues related to regulatory permits, audits or requirements, could require us to delay shipment of saleable products, recall products previously shipped or impair our ability to supply products at all.

We endeavor to qualify and register new vendors and to develop contingency plans so that production is not materially impacted by third-party provider issues. Nonetheless, any such third-party provider issues could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share and damage our reputation, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

In addition, we rely heavily on the three largest pharmaceutical wholesalers in the U.S. market—Cardinal Health Inc., Cencora, and McKesson Corp—in the distribution of the products that we market and sell in the U.S. If we are unable to maintain our business relationships with these wholesalers on commercially acceptable terms, if these wholesalers experience prolonged business disruptions, if the buying patterns of these wholesalers fluctuate due to seasonality or any other reason or if wholesaler buying decisions or other factors outside of our control change, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

If we or our third-party providers fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of our products, we could incur substantial remedial costs and experience a reduction in sales and/or revenues.

We and the third-party providers involved in our manufacturing activities are generally required to comply with cGMP regulations and other applicable non-U.S. standards in the manufacture of our products or components of our products. Additionally, if any of our products or components of our products in the U.S. are scheduled by the DEA as controlled substances, we would also be subject to DEA regulations. We and our third-party providers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and other governmental agencies to confirm compliance with all applicable laws. Any changes to our suppliers or modifications of methods of manufacturing require submission of amendments to our marketing applications to the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies, and ultimate acceptance by such agencies of such amendments, prior to release of product to the applicable marketplace. Our inability, or the inability of our third-party providers, to demonstrate ongoing compliance with cGMP or other regulatory requirements could require us to withdraw or recall products and interrupt clinical and commercial supply of our products. Any delay, interruption or other issues that may arise in the manufacture, formulation, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or operations or the facilities or operations of third-party providers to pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop, obtain and maintain regulatory approval of, and commercialize or supply, products. This interruption could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share and damage our reputation with our collaboration partners or in the market generally.

In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law in the U.S., and served to increase the FDA’s existing authority with respect to drug shortage measures. Under the CARES Act, for each facility where marketed products for certain serious diseases or conditions are manufactured, or where components of such products are manufactured, we are required to have a risk management plan in place that identifies and evaluates risks to the supply of such products or product components, which plans may be subject to review during any FDA inspection. Each of our facilities operates in accordance with a comprehensive quality management system, which includes risk assessment, preventive actions and regular review of inventory levels for each of the marketed products that we manufacture; however, the FDA may not consider our risk management program to be sufficient upon inspection and we may still experience

38

shortages in the supply of marketed products that we manufacture, which could materially adversely affect the patients who rely on such marketed products and our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The FDA and various regulatory agencies outside the U.S. have inspected and approved our commercial manufacturing facilities. However, the FDA and any other regulatory agencies may not approve any other facility that we or our third-party providers may operate and, once approved, any of these facilities may not remain in compliance with cGMP and other regulations. Any third party we use to manufacture bulk drug product for use in the U.S. must be licensed by the FDA. Failure by us or our third-party providers to gain or maintain regulatory compliance with and approvals from the FDA or other regulatory agencies could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Our success largely depends upon our ability to attract, recognize and retain key personnel.

Our ability to compete and succeed in the highly competitive biopharmaceutical industry and in the disease states in which we market and sell products depends largely upon our ability to attract, recognize and retain highly skilled technical, scientific, manufacturing, management, regulatory, legal, compliance and selling and marketing personnel. Each of our executive officers and all of our employees are employed “at will,” meaning we or each officer or employee may terminate the employment relationship at any time. We face intense competition for employees due to, among many factors, the geographic locations in which we operate and the competitive benefits and compensation practices in our industry, and in recent years, new competition as employees are increasingly able to work remotely. The loss of key personnel due to any of these factors or our inability to hire and retain personnel who have technical, scientific, manufacturing, management, regulatory, legal, compliance or commercial backgrounds could materially adversely impact our business, including the achievement of our manufacturing, research and development, commercial, financial and other operational and strategic business objectives.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property

Patent and other IP protection for our products is key to our business and our competitive position but is uncertain.

Receiving and maintaining patent and/or trademark protection for our products and technologies, including those that are subject to our licensing arrangements, maintaining our trade secrets, not infringing the proprietary rights of others, and preventing others from infringing our proprietary rights are each key to our success and our competitive position.

Patent protection provides rights of exclusivity for the term of the patent. We are able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. In this regard, we try to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and elsewhere related to our proprietary product inventions and improvements that are important to our business and products. Our pending patent applications, together with those we may file in the future, or those we may license to or from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. Even if issued, such patents may not provide us with sufficient proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products or technology. Because the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions, enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. The ultimate degree of patent protection that will be afforded to products and processes, including ours and those of our licensees, in the U.S. and in other important markets, remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. The development of new technologies or products may take a number of years, and there can be no assurance that any patents which may be granted in respect of such technologies or products will not have expired or be due to expire by the time such products are commercialized, or that such patents will successfully withstand any challenges during their respective terms.

Although we make reasonable efforts to protect our IP rights and to ensure that our proprietary products and technologies do not infringe the IP rights of third parties, we cannot ascertain the existence of all potentially conflicting IP claims. Therefore, there is a risk that third parties may make claims of infringement against our products or technologies. If patents exist or are issued that cover our products or technologies, we may not be able to manufacture, use, offer for sale, sell or import such products without first getting a license from the patent holder. The patent holder may not grant us a license on reasonable terms, or it may refuse to grant us a license at all. This could delay or prevent us from developing, manufacturing, selling or importing those of our products that would require the license. Claims of IP infringement may also require that we redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement that may serve to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot, or do not, license the infringed IP on reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar IP from another source, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

39

The laws of certain countries may not protect our IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and any patents that we own or license from others may not provide any protection against competitors. In addition, in the case of certain of our licensed products or products incorporating our licensed technology, our licensees are responsible for prosecuting, maintaining, enforcing and defending the IP related to the product(s) from which we derive revenue. Their failure to secure, maintain, enforce and defend this IP could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.

We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and inventions, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it, such as our licensees, licensors, contract manufacturers, potential business partners, employees and consultants. However, any of these parties may breach such agreements and may disclose our confidential information, or our competitors might learn of the information in some other way. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use IP owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. If any trade secret, know-how or other invention not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, such event could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Uncertainty over IP in the biopharmaceutical industry has been the source of litigation and other legal proceedings, and we or our licensees may face claims against IP rights covering our products and competition from generic drug manufacturers.

There is considerable uncertainty within the biopharmaceutical industry about the validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. We cannot currently determine the ultimate scope, validity and enforceability of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents third parties may assert are infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of our products.

Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As our products achieve greater commercial sales, potential competitors are more likely to seek to challenge our patents. In the biopharmaceutical industry, there has been, and we expect that there may continue to be, significant litigation, 
inter partes 
reviews (“IPRs”), post-grant reviews (“PGRs”) and administrative proceedings regarding patents and other IP rights. A third party may file an IPR, PGR, interference and/or infringement action against us, including in response to patent certifications required under the Hatch-Waxman Act, claiming that certain claims of one or more of our issued patents are invalid or that the manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or import of our products infringed one or more of such party’s patents. For example, in December 2024, Argentum Pharmaceuticals LLC filed a request with the USPTO for 
ex parte 
reexamination of the validity of certain claims of our U.S. Patent No. 7,919,499 that covers VIVITROL, which request was granted in January 2025 and is pending. And in January 2025, Apotex Inc. filed with the USPTO a petition for IPR of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,919,499 that cover VIVITROL, which petition has not yet been instituted.

In addition, we may need to enforce our IP rights against third parties who infringe on our patents and other IP or challenge our patents, patent applications or trademark applications. In the U.S., generic manufacturers of innovator drug products may file ANDAs and, in connection with such filings, certify that their products do not infringe the innovator’s patents or that the innovator’s patents are invalid. This often results in litigation between the innovator and the ANDA applicant, commonly known in the U.S. as “Paragraph IV” litigation, which can be expensive, protracted and distracting to management, with no certainty of success. For example, Teva entities filed an ANDA seeking approval to engage in the commercial manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of VIVITROL and alleged that one of our Orange-Book patents related to VIVITROL is invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva’s proposed product. In response, we initiated a Paragraph IV lawsuit against Teva in September 2020 to dispute such claims.

We may have to expend considerable time, effort and resources to defend such actions, and litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights. In order to avoid or resolve timely and costly IP litigation or IPR, PGR or other administrative proceedings, we may enter into settlement agreements in which we grant an adverse party certain rights with respect to our IP. For example, in August 2023, following a trial in the Teva patent infringement lawsuit discussed above, we entered into a confidential settlement and license agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Teva in August 2023 to resolve the proceedings between the parties. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we granted Teva a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable limited license to market and sell a generic version of VIVITROL in the U.S. beginning on January 15, 2027, or earlier under certain circumstances. And in July 2019, in order to resolve an IPR instituted by Amneal with the PTAB, we granted Amneal a non-exclusive license under certain patents covering VIVITROL, including the latest to expire patent covering VIVITROL in the U.S., to market and sell a generic formulation of VIVITROL in the U.S. beginning sometime in 2027 or earlier under certain circumstances.

There can be no assurance that we or our licensees will prevail or settle any IP legal proceedings or disputes on favorable terms. Our and our licensees’ existing patents could be invalidated, found unenforceable or found not to cover generic forms of our or our licensees’ products. If any ANDA filers were to receive FDA approval to sell generic versions of our products or the products from which we receive revenue and/or prevail in any patent litigation with respect to such products, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Risks Related to Regulatory or Legal Matters

Litigation or arbitration filed against Alkermes, including securities litigation, or actions (such as citizens petitions) filed against regulatory agencies in respect of our products, may result in financial losses, harm our reputation, divert management resources, negatively impact the approval of our products, or otherwise negatively impact our business.

We are, and may in the future become, involved in various legal proceedings, including those asserting violations of securities and/or fraud and abuse laws and those asserting claims related to product liability, IP and/or contractual arrangements. Such proceedings may include claims for, or the possibility of, damages or fines and penalties involving substantial amounts of money or other relief, including but not limited to civil or criminal fines and penalties. Such legal proceedings and the preparation therefor may result in substantial costs to us and diversion of management’s attention and resources, which in turn could harm our business. Moreover, if any of such legal proceedings were to result in an adverse outcome, such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Further, our liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to satisfy, or may not cover, any expenses or liabilities that may arise. Additionally, regardless of whether or not there is merit to the claims underlying any legal proceedings to which we are subject, or whether or not we are found as a result of such lawsuits to have violated any applicable laws, such lawsuits and inquiries can be expensive to defend or respond to, may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in managing our business, and may further cause significant and potentially irreparable harm to our public reputation.

We have been, and may again be, the subject of citizen petitions or litigation that request that the FDA refuse to approve, delay or withdraw approval of, or impose additional approval requirements on our marketing applications. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the marketing application in question or cause such marketing application approval to be withdrawn. Even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition, or may impose additional approval or post-approval requirements as a result of such petition. These outcomes and others could adversely affect our share price as well as our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our products and products using our proprietary technologies.

The clinical study or commercial use of our products may cause unintended side effects or adverse reactions, or incidents of misuse may occur, which could adversely affect our products, business and share price.

We cannot predict whether the clinical or commercial use of our products will produce undesirable or unintended side effects that have not been evident in the use of, or in clinical trials conducted for, such products to date. The administration of drugs in humans carries the inherent risk of product liability claims whether or not the drugs are actually the cause of an injury. Our products may cause, may appear to have caused or may be claimed to have caused, injury or dangerous drug interactions, and we may not learn about or understand those claims or effects until the products have been administered to patients for a prolonged period of time. Additionally, incidents of product misuse may occur.

These events, among others, could result in product recalls or additional regulatory controls (including additional regulatory scrutiny, REMS programs, and/or requirements for additional labeling) or product liability actions. As our development activities progress and we continue to have commercial sales, our product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to satisfy liabilities that arise, we may be unable to obtain adequate coverage at an acceptable cost or at all, or our insurer may disclaim coverage as to a future claim. This could prevent or limit the development or commercialization of our products. In addition, the reporting of adverse safety events involving our products, including instances of product misuse, and public perceptions about such events, could cause our product sales or share price to decline or experience periods of volatility. These types of events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.

We participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the 340B program, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ FSS pricing program, and the Tricare program, and have obligations to report the average sales price for certain of our drugs to the Medicare program.

Pricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts, which can change and evolve over time. In the case of our Medicaid pricing data, if we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are generally obligated to resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products under the 340B program and give rise to an obligation to refund entities participating in the 340B program for overcharges during past quarters impacted by a price recalculation.

41

Civil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false price or product information to the government, if we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price, if we fail to submit the required price data on a timely basis, or if we are found to have charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. CMS could also decide to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect.

Our failure to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental programs could negatively impact our financial results. CMS issued a final regulation, which became effective in April 2016, to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the Affordable Care Act. Since that time, CMS has issued multiple proposed and final rules that change the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Regulatory and legislative changes, and judicial rulings relating to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and related policies, have increased and will continue to increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, have been and will continue to be time-consuming to implement, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly if CMS or another agency challenges the approach we take in our implementation.

HRSA issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective in January 2019. Implementation of this regulation could affect our obligations and potential liability under the 340B program in ways we cannot anticipate. We are also required to report the 340B ceiling prices for our covered outpatient drugs to HRSA, which then publishes them to 340B covered entities. Any charge by HRSA that we have violated this regulation or other requirements of the program could negatively impact our financial results. Moreover, HRSA has established an administrative dispute resolution (“ADR”) process, which is governed by a final regulation effective June 2024, for claims by covered entities that a manufacturer engaged in overcharging, including claims that a manufacturer limited the ability of a covered entity to purchase the manufacturer’s drugs at the 340B ceiling price, and by manufacturers that a covered entity violated the prohibitions against diversion or duplicate discounts. Such claims are to be resolved through an ADR panel of government officials rendering a decision that could be appealed only in federal court. An ADR proceeding could potentially subject us to discovery by covered entities and other onerous procedural requirements and could result in additional liability. HRSA could also decide to terminate a manufacturer’s agreement to participate in the 340B program for a violation of that agreement or other good cause shown, in which case the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs may no longer be eligible for federal payment under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B program.

Further, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would, among other things, further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in an inpatient setting, and any additional future changes to the definition of average manufacturer price or the Medicaid rebate amount could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations. Additionally, we have implemented a policy governing the eligibility of covered entities to purchase our products at the 340B price for shipment to a contract pharmacy. We implemented this policy out of concern that contract pharmacy arrangements are diverting the benefits of the 340B program from patients to contract pharmacies and contributing to the pervasive lack of transparency within the 340B program, rendering it difficult to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and product diversion. Certain pharmaceutical manufacturers and the industry group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (“PhRMA”) are involved in ongoing litigation with the HRSA regarding manufacturer initiatives that restrict covered entities’ ability to purchase products at the 340B program price for shipment through an unlimited number of contract pharmacies. Additionally, several states have enacted, and many other states are considering, laws that prohibit manufacturer restrictions on contract pharmacies. Certain pharmaceutical manufacturers and PhRMA have initiated litigation challenging these state laws. The outcome of pending judicial proceedings and the potential impact on the way in which manufacturers extend discounts to covered entities through contract pharmacies remain uncertain and negative legal rulings, or the passage of legislation in respect of this topic, may materially adversely impact our results of operations.

We have obligations to report the average sales price for certain of our drugs to the Medicare program. In addition, we are required to report the best price for our drugs, as defined under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to CMS. Statutory or regulatory changes or changes in CMS guidance could affect the average sales price or best price calculations for our products and the resulting Medicare payment rate or rebates we owe to state Medicaid programs. Such changes could negatively impact our results of operations.

Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with price reporting under the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, FSS or Tricare programs can subject a manufacturer to civil monetary penalties. These program obligations also contain extensive disclosure and certification requirements. If we overcharge the government in connection with our arrangements with FSS or Tricare, we are required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.

42

Our business involves environmental, health and safety risks.

Our business involves the use of hazardous materials and chemicals and is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to periodic inspections for possible violations of these laws and regulations. Under certain of these laws and regulations, we could be liable for any contamination at our current or former properties or third-party waste disposal sites. In addition to significant remediation costs, contamination can give rise to third-party claims for fines, penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury and damage (including property damage). The costs of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are significant. We have developed and implemented a proprietary risk mitigation program to preemptively identify and address environmental, health, safety and security risks; however, there can be no assurance that a violation of current or future environmental, health or safety laws or regulations will not occur. Any violations, even if inadvertent or accidental, or the cost of compliance with any resulting order, fine or liability that may be imposed, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Risks Related to our Financial Condition and Tax Matters

We may not be able to maintain profitability on a sustained basis.

At December 31, 2024, our accumulated deficit was $1.0 billion, which was primarily the result of net losses incurred from continuing operations from 1987, the year Alkermes, Inc. was founded, through December 31, 2022, partially offset by net income from continuing operations over certain fiscal periods, including net income earned during the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Our ability to maintain profitability on a sustained basis will depend on our ability to continue to grow and diversify our revenue and to effectively and efficiently manage our costs. Factors that may impact our future revenue, and in turn our future profitability, include, among others, our or our licensees’ (as applicable) ability to:

•
successfully commercialize VIVITROL, the ARISTADA product family, LYBALVI, VUMERITY, XEPLION, INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA and INVEGA HAFYERA/BYANNLI and any other marketed products from which we earn revenue in the countries in which such products are approved;

•
successfully develop, and obtain and maintain regulatory approval for, products in the U.S. and/or in other countries; 

•
successfully manufacture our products and third-party products efficiently and in a cost-effective manner;

•
obtain adequate reimbursement coverage for our products and third-party products from insurance companies, government programs and other third-party payers;

•
successfully protect and defend our confidential information and IP rights related to our technologies and our products;

•
achieve product development or sales milestones under our collaborative arrangements; and

•
resolve favorably any commercial disputes that may arise in respect of collaborative arrangements from which we receive revenues. 

Factors that may impact our future spend, and in turn our future profitability, include, among others:

•
the scope of our research and development activities, including the number of programs, products, indications or new technologies that we may pursue, and our ability, if sought, to share development costs through potential collaborations;

•
the time and expense required to pursue FDA and/or other regulatory approvals for our products; 

•
the time and expense required to prosecute, enforce, defend and/or challenge patent and other IP rights; 

•
the costs of operating and maintaining our manufacturing and research facilities, including the costs and availability of raw materials or components of our products; 

•
the costs of doing business with third-party vendors, including suppliers, manufacturers, packagers and distributors and CROs; 

•
the scope and costs of our commercial activities, including expansion of our sales force and our investment in direct-to-consumer campaigns and other initiatives;

•
the cost of possible business development activities, including licenses or acquisitions of technologies, compounds or product rights or the potential acquisition of other assets, including equipment, facilities or businesses; 

•
the costs related to potential litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings or government requests for information; 

•
the costs of defending against potential or actual proxy contests or other activist shareholder actions; 

43

•
the costs of compliance with new regulations applicable to us, including those related to the measurement, reporting and assurance of environmental performance data and other sustainability matters; and 

•
the costs associated with recruiting, compensating and retaining a highly-skilled workforce in an environment where competition for highly-skilled employees is intense. 

We have broad discretion regarding use of our cash and cash equivalents and we may not allocate our cash in ways that ultimately increase the value of our ordinary shares.

We have broad discretion in the allocation of our cash and cash equivalents and we may not allocate our cash in ways that ultimately increase the value of our ordinary shares. We could make capital allocation decisions to utilize such funds in a way that our shareholders do not agree with or that do not ultimately generate shareholder value in the manner they, or we, anticipate or at all. If our cash and cash equivalents are not deployed effectively or do not generate shareholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results or other business objectives, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our ordinary shares.

Certain U.S. holders of our ordinary shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are characterized as a “controlled foreign corporation”.

In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”) was signed into law. This legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, changing the rules which determine whether a foreign corporation is treated for U.S. tax purposes as a controlled foreign corporation (“CFC”) for taxable years ended December 31, 2017 and onwards. The impact of this change on certain holders of our ordinary shares is uncertain and could be adverse, including potential income inclusions and reporting requirements for U.S. persons (as defined in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) who are treated as owning (directly or indirectly) at least 10% of the value or voting power of our shares. The determination of CFC status is complex and includes attribution rules, the application of which are not entirely certain. These changes to the attribution rules relating to the determination of CFC status make it possible that one or more of our non-U.S. subsidiaries will be classified as a CFC. Existing and prospective investors should consult their tax advisers regarding the potential application of these rules to their investments in our securities.

See “
Certain Irish and United States Federal Income Tax Considerations – United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
” in our Form S-1/A, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2012, for additional discussion with respect to other potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of investments in us.

If goodwill becomes impaired, we may have to take significant charges against earnings.

At December 31, 2024, we had $83.0 million of goodwill. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill has been impaired. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity in future periods.

Our effective tax rate may increase.

As a global biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to taxation in a number of different jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these places. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the distribution of our profits or losses between the jurisdictions where we operate and differences in interpretation of tax laws. In addition, the tax laws of any jurisdiction in which we operate may change in the future, which could impact our effective tax rate. Tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may audit us. If we are unsuccessful in defending any tax positions adopted in our submitted tax returns, we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods, interest, fines or penalties, and may be obligated to pay increased taxes in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our financial condition.

The U.S. Congress, the EU, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business are focused on the taxation of multinational corporations. As a result of this focus, the tax laws in Ireland and the U.S. could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect us.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act amended Section 174 of the Code (“Section 174”) and, with effect from January 2022, eliminated the option to deduct R&D expenses in the year incurred and instead requires taxpayers to capitalize, and subsequently amortize such expenses over five years for research activities conducted in the U.S., and over fifteen years for research activities conducted outside of the U.S. As such, we expect a material decrease in cash flows provided from operations and a material increase in our net U.S. deferred tax assets over the next number of years, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

In December 2022, the EU implemented a new corporate minimum tax rate of 15% on companies with combined annual revenue of at least €750.0 million, which was transposed into Irish law effective as of January 1, 2024. We do not expect such rules to have a material effect on our business in 2025; however, such minimum tax rate rules or other similar rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations in future years.

Our deferred tax assets may not be realized.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $121.6 million of net deferred tax assets in the U.S. It is possible that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, especially if we incur losses in the U.S. in the future. Losses may arise from operating events (including clinical program progression), or the occurrence of significant excess tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock unit awards. Unless we are able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, a substantial valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our U.S. deferred tax assets may be required, which would materially increase our expenses in the period the valuation allowance is recognized and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, we have included within our U.S. net deferred tax assets of $121.6 million an amount of $30.0 million relating to employee share-based compensation expense. It is possible that a significant portion of this deferred tax asset will not be realized, especially if the price of our ordinary shares remains at its current level (see “Item 5—Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in this Annual Report for details of the price of our ordinary shares). Unless the price of our ordinary shares increases, we will incur a deferred tax expense as our U.S.-based employees exercise or forfeit their stock options and their restricted stock unit awards vest. This could significantly increase our tax expense and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

The disposition of the Athlone Facility may limit our ability to use our net operating losses and result in unanticipated tax liabilities.

As of December 31, 2023, we had $94.7 million of net deferred tax assets in Ireland, including $87.5 million relating to net operating losses (“NOLs”). These NOLs can be carried forward, without time limit, against trading income of the same trade in future accounting periods. In May 2024, we completed the sale of the Athlone Facility to Novo. The disposition of the Athlone Facility may be deemed to result in (i) a significant change to the existing trade such that the same trade is no longer continued, and (ii) a complete discontinuance of the existing trade and the commencement of a new trade. We do not believe that the disposition of the Athlone Facility would amount to a significant change or a discontinuance of our existing trade; however, the Irish Tax Authority could assert a contrary position, in which case we could become involved in tax controversy with the Irish Tax Authority regarding possible additional tax liabilities. If we were to be unsuccessful in resolving any such tax controversy in our favor, we could be liable for significant additional tax liabilities than that which we anticipate, which would materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

The IRS may not agree with our conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

In September 2011, the business of Alkermes, Inc., a U.S. corporation, and the drug technology business of Elan Corporation, plc, an Irish-incorporated public limited company, were combined under Alkermes plc, an Irish-incorporated public limited company (the “Business Combination”). For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation is generally considered tax resident in the place of its incorporation. Because we are incorporated in Ireland, we should be classified as an Irish corporation under these general rules. However, Section 7874 of the Code generally provides that a corporation organized outside the U.S. that acquires substantially all of the assets of a corporation organized in the U.S. will be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation own at least 80% (of either the voting power or the value) of the stock of the acquiring foreign corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation, and the “expanded affiliated group” (as defined in Section 7874) that includes the acquiring corporation does not have substantial business activities in the country in which it is organized.

45

We believe that Alkermes plc should be classified as an Irish tax resident corporation and should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, the IRS could assert a contrary position, in which case we could become involved in tax controversy with the IRS regarding possible additional U.S. tax liability. If we were to be unsuccessful in resolving any such tax controversy in our favor, we could be liable for significant additional U.S. federal and state income tax than those we anticipate, which would materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

If the separation of our oncology business completed in November 2023 does not ultimately qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal and Irish tax purposes as we anticipate, we and/or our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.

In connection with the separation of our oncology business into Mural Oncology plc completed in November 2023, we sought and received a private letter ruling from the IRS (the “IRS Ruling”) and an opinion from our U.S. tax advisor (the “U.S. Tax Opinion”) regarding U.S. federal income tax consequences of the separation, including that, among other things, the separation would be expected to generally qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The IRS Ruling and/or the U.S. Tax Opinion were based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from us and Mural Oncology plc, including those relating to past and future conduct of the companies’ respective business operations and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or Mural Oncology plc breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents, the IRS Ruling and/or the U.S. Tax Opinion may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. Notwithstanding the U.S. Tax Opinion or IRS Ruling, the IRS could determine that a distribution or any related transaction is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions in the U.S. Tax Opinion. The U.S. Tax Opinion will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS or the courts may challenge the conclusions stated in the U.S. Tax Opinion and such challenge could prevail. If the separation transaction is ultimately determined to be taxable, we and/or our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant tax liabilities.

Furthermore, in connection with the separation, we sought and received an opinion from our Irish tax advisor (the “Irish Tax Opinion”) regarding the Irish tax consequences of the separation. The Irish Tax Opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from us, including those relating to past and future conduct of our business operations and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete the Irish Tax Opinion may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. The Irish Tax Opinion will not be binding on the Irish Tax Authority or the Irish courts. Accordingly, the Irish Tax Authority or the Irish courts may challenge the conclusions stated in the Irish Tax Opinion and such challenge could prevail. In such an event, we and/or our shareholders could incur significant tax liabilities.

Our business strategy may involve future transactions which may harm the market price of our ordinary shares or require us to seek additional funds, and such funding may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all and may cause dilution to our existing shareholders.

In order to achieve our business strategy, we regularly review potential transactions related to technologies, products or product rights or other assets, and businesses that are complementary to our business, including mergers and acquisitions, licenses and collaborations, and development and supply, commercialization or co-promotion arrangements, among others. We may choose to enter into one or more of these or other transactions at any time, which may cause substantial fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares. Moreover, depending upon the nature of any transaction, we may experience a charge to earnings, which could also materially adversely affect our results of operations and could harm the market price of our ordinary shares.

In order to finance such transactions, we may require additional funds, and we may seek such funds through various sources, including debt and equity offerings, corporate collaborations, bank borrowings, arrangements relating to assets, monetization of royalty streams or other financing methods or structures. The source, timing and availability of any financing will depend on global economic conditions, credit and financial market conditions, interest rates and other factors. If we issue additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, our shareholders would suffer dilution of their investment, and it may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. In addition, under Irish law, the directors of an Irish public limited company must have specific authority, as approved by the company’s shareholders, to allot and issue any ordinary shares (other than pursuant to employee equity plans) and, if such directors desire to allot and issue ordinary shares for cash, such shares must first be offered on the same or more favorable terms to the Company’s existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis, unless this statutory pre-emption right is disapplied by approval of the company’s shareholders. In May 2024, our shareholders renewed our board of directors’ general authority to allot and issue ordinary shares in an amount equal to approximately 20% of our issued ordinary share capital (as of April 10, 2024), and to issue ordinary shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis in an amount equal to approximately 20% of our issued share capital (as of April 10, 2024); however, these share issuance authorities were granted for eighteen months only, at which point they will lapse unless renewed by our shareholders. If we are unable to obtain renewal of share issuance authorities from our shareholders, or are otherwise

46

limited by the terms of new share issuance authorities approved by our shareholders, our ability to use our authorized but unissued share capital to effect or to fund acquisition or other transaction opportunities, or to otherwise raise capital, could be adversely affected.

In addition, future investors or lenders may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing shareholders. If we issue debt securities, we would likely be subject to restrictive covenants and debt service obligations that may impact our operations and financial condition. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available from any of these sources when needed or, if available, will be on acceptable terms. If we fail to obtain additional capital if needed, we may not be able to execute our business strategy successfully.

Even if we are able to finance potential transactions without seeking any external financing, expenditure of a significant amount of cash on such transactions may require difficult capital allocation decisions and may limit our ability to pursue other important business and strategic objectives, may significantly impact our financial condition and profitability and limit our potential to return capital to shareholders. As a result of these and other potential impacts, the market price of our ordinary shares may fluctuate significantly.

Currency exchange rates may affect revenues and expenses.

We conduct a large portion of our business in international markets. For example, we derive all of our XEPLION, TREVICTA and BYANNLI revenues from sales in countries other than the U.S., and these sales are denominated in non-U.S. dollar (“USD”) currencies. We also incur substantial operating costs in Ireland and face exposure to changes in the exchange ratio of the USD and the euro arising from expenses and payables at our Irish operations that are settled in euro. Our efforts to mitigate the impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates may not be successful. As a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, USD, and the currencies in which we do business will affect our results of operations, often in unpredictable ways. See “Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in this Annual Report for additional information relating to our foreign currency exchange rate risk.

Risks Related to our Ordinary Shares

The market price of our ordinary shares has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future, and could decline significantly.

The market price of our ordinary shares has fluctuated significantly from time to time. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the closing price of our ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market ranged from $23.01 to $32.56 per share. The market price of our ordinary shares is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and industry factors, our results of operations, our ability to maintain and increase sales of our products, the success of our key development programs and expansion of our development pipeline and commercial portfolio, our ability to achieve and sustain profitability, the outcomes of business development transactions in which we may participate, our capital allocation decisions, and other factors, including the risk factors described in this Annual Report. We have also experienced significant volatility in the market price of our ordinary shares based on our business performance, including in relation to our commercial sales and the financial guidance that we issue for such sales, results from our clinical development programs, and events relating to regulatory actions and interactions related to our product candidates and commercial products.

In addition, the stock market in general, including the market for biopharmaceutical companies, has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, negative publicity regarding pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies, and potential legislation to regulate drug pricing, has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the market for biopharmaceutical companies. These broad market and industry factors have harmed, and in the future may harm, the market price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our operating performance.

Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders.

Proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders have been waged against many companies in our industry over the last several years. Activist shareholders may agitate, either publicly or privately, for changes to a company’s board of directors, management, structure, spend or strategic direction, among other things.

Proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting operations and diverting the attention of management and employees, and can lead to perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of the Company or its business that may result in the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or in-licensing opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. In addition, if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our strategic plan in a timely manner and create additional value for our shareholders.

47

In recent years, we engaged in extensive dialogue with principals of Elliot Investment Management L.P. and Sarissa Capital Offshore Master Fund LP and their affiliates, resulting in negotiation of settlement arrangements in 2020 and 2021 pursuant to which directors were elected to our Board and a contested election in 2023. The extensive interactions and activities related to our engagement with activist shareholders required the expenditure of time, energy and expense by management and our board of directors and diverted employee and management attention from business operations.

Any future activist shareholder interactions, contests, actions or requests, or the mere public presence of activist shareholders among our shareholder base, could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to experience periods of significant volatility.

Risks Related to Information Security and Data Privacy

Information security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.

In the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party service providers collect, store, maintain and transmit sensitive data, including IP, proprietary business information of ours and that of our suppliers and partners, as well as personally identifiable information of persons who use our medicines, clinical trial participants and employees. In addition, we outsource some of our operations to a number of third-party vendors who may have, or could gain, access to our confidential information. The secure maintenance of all such information and the secure performance of our information technology (“IT”) systems are critical to our operations and business strategy.

As our dependency on, and the complexity of, our IT systems increases, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT systems and the data that they store is critical to managing our business. While we take prudent measures to secure our IT systems, the risk still exists that such systems may become compromised by successful breaches, malfeasance, human error or technological fault. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices to access confidential information, remote working practices, and the increased use of artificial intelligence present new and increased risk of security breaches. Cyber-attacks have increased in frequency, persistence, sophistication and intensity, often conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage, hacktivists and organized crime). In addition to the extraction of important information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information. Certain types of attacks or breaches on our IT systems or infrastructure, or those of our licensees and third-party providers, may go undetected for a prolonged period. Although to our knowledge we have not experienced any material incident or interruption to date, any breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or breach of our, our partners’ or our third-party providers’ technology systems could compromise such IT systems, and the information stored there could be accessed, modified, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. This could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, demands for ransom or other forms of blackmail, disruptions to our development programs or commercial operations, damage to our reputation and adverse effects on our business. We retain cybersecurity insurance to cover costs and expenses related to a breach or similar event; however, there is no guarantee that such costs and expenses would not exceed the insurance that we retain.

We may be subject to numerous and varying privacy and security laws, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and reputational damage.

In the ordinary course of business, we may process personal data and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, data we collect about trial participants in connection with clinical trials, patient data and sensitive third-party data. Our data processing activities subjects us to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of personal information, including health information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business.

In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, federal and state consumer protection laws, and state health information privacy laws (for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Such federal and state laws and regulations may require businesses to provide specific disclosures and implement processes to permit individuals to exercise certain privacy rights, which in each case could increase our potential liability, increase our compliance costs, and affect our ability to collect and use personal information. The privacy regulation landscape is rapidly evolving, and any changes to existing legislation or adoption of new state or federal regulations may further complicate compliance efforts and further increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties upon whom we rely. In addition, each of these current and potential future laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and the third parties upon whom we rely. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to penalties or sanctions, including criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HIPAA).

48

Numerous other countries have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information as well. The EU and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the EU, for example, the GDPR governs the processing of personal data. The GDPR imposes significant obligations on controllers and processors of personal data, including high standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, robust notification requirements to individuals about the processing of their personal data, a strong individual data rights regime, mandatory data breach notifications, limitations on the retention of personal data and stringent requirements pertaining to health data, and strict rules and restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, including to the U.S. The GDPR also imposes additional obligations on, and required contractual provisions to be included in, contracts between companies subject to the GDPR and their third-party processors that relate to the processing of personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to adopt additional laws and regulations in order to introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data.

Adoption of the GDPR increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and may require us to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance. Any failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and applicable national data protection laws of EU member states could lead to regulatory enforcement actions and significant administrative and/or financial penalties against us (fines of up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher), and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

General Risk Factors

A future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments affecting us and/or the third parties on which we rely could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted the operation of healthcare systems, global travel, supply and labor markets and other business and economic activity worldwide, had a disruptive and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations and on those of many of the third parties on which we rely.

Although the acute COVID-19 public health emergency has lapsed, we will continue to monitor its long-term impacts, including impacts on market practices and on the labor market, and adjust our policies and practices as needed to mitigate any adverse impacts to our business operations and financial condition. We will also work with our internal teams and the third-parties on which we rely to assess, and seek to mitigate, the potential impacts on our business operations and financial condition of any future outbreaks of contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments that may emerge from time to time.

If we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to meet our reporting obligations and the trading price of our ordinary shares could be negatively affected.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we report contains material errors.

We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, or we discover areas that need improvement in the future, these shortcomings could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results, and the price of our ordinary shares could be negatively affected.

If we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could lead to a decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares. Failure to comply with reporting requirements could also subject us to sanctions and/or investigations by Nasdaq or the SEC or other regulatory authorities.

49

The increasing use of social media platforms and artificial intelligence tools present new risks and challenges.

Social media is increasingly being used as a means of corporate communications and for purposes of social networking and commentary. We use social media tools to communicate certain information about our business, our employees, our company values and initiatives, to support disease state education in our areas of focus, and to provide information about our products or development programs. Additionally, the use of artificial intelligence tools (“AI”) is increasing in the biopharmaceutical industry and, as with many developing technologies, presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption and use. Despite our efforts to monitor evolving guidance regarding use of social media and AI and to comply with applicable rules, regulations and regulatory guidance, such practices are evolving and can be unclear. There is a risk that the use of social media and AI by us or our employees to communicate about our products or business or for other business purposes may cause us to be found in violation of applicable requirements and could result in regulatory actions or legal claims against us related to off-label marketing or other prohibited activities. In addition, our employees may knowingly or inadvertently engage on social media and with AI in ways that may not comply with our social media policy or guidelines with respect to AI or other legal, contractual or regulatory requirements. Any misuse of social media or AI may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets and other IP, result in public disclosure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial participants, customers, patients using our products, or others, result in reputational harm or lead to other consequences. Negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us or our products on any social media or other public platforms could also damage our reputation, brand image and goodwill. Any of these events, if they were to occur, could cause us to incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or suffer reputational or other harm to our business.

Risk Management and Strategy

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including IP, proprietary business information of ours and that of our suppliers and licensees, and personally identifiable information of persons who use our medicines, clinical trial participants and employees. Our licensees and third-party providers also possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of such information and the secure performance of our information technology (“IT”) systems are critical to our operations and business strategy. As our dependency on, and the complexity of, our IT systems increases, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT systems and the data that they store is critical to managing our business.
Our Information Security Management System (“ISMS”) is a key element of our information security program, designed to identify, assess, help mitigate, and monitor IT risks across our organization, including information security risks. The ISMS is informed by the structured principles of International Standard- ISO/IEC27001:2022 (Information security, cybersecurity, and privacy protection), which outlines guidance for the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and improvement of information security management systems. Our ISMS is comprised of processes designed to identify cybersecurity risks, safeguard information assets and preserve the confidentiality, 
integrity
, and availability of information owned, managed and maintained by us. Our ISMS includes formal written policies and procedures, technical security controls, such as automated tools designed to detect and prevent cybersecurity incidents, and programs designed to promote internal and third-party IT risk management, audit management, incident response and security awareness, including employee awareness trainings and other initiatives. Our ISMS includes periodic security audits, vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to proactively identify potential system vulnerabilities. 
Our ISMS is periodically assessed by third-party assessors
 and the results of such assessments, including any cybersecurity risks and related mitigations identified, are reported to the audit and risk committee of our board of directors, as described below, and are used by us to improve our ISMS and our broader information security program.

As part of our information security program, we also have processes in place for management of cybersecurity risks associated with third-party handling of our confidential information, including in such third parties’ provision of critical services on our behalf. We conduct due diligence of our third-party vendors through an assessment of their security practices and overall risk profile, including through their completion of vendor assessment questionnaires and ongoing monitoring of such third parties, utilizing tools such as security ratings services and periodic reassessment questionnaires. 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not experienced any information security incidents that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, and we have not identified any current cybersecurity threats that we believe are reasonably likely to 
materially affect
 our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.

Governance and Oversight
We have a multi-layered information security governance framework in place to provide oversight of our information security program and strategy, our ISMS, and related risks and opportunities. 
This governance framework includes procedures for escalation of identified information security risks, threats or incidents through various management levels, including up to our Information Security Governing Body, which is comprised of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer and other members of management, and as appropriate, up to our board of directors. 
Our information security team is responsible for developing, implementing and overseeing our Company-wide information security strategy and related policies and practices.
 This team works cross-functionally throughout our organization to assess and prepare the Company for identification and mitigation of, and if necessary respond to, information security risks.

The information security team is led by our Chief Information Officer
, who has over 35 years of experience in various information technology roles, including 18 years at the Company serving in roles with increasing levels of responsibility. Our Vice President of Information Security and Technology, a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, with over 20 years of global experience in various information security roles, including 14 years of experience at the Company, is responsible for day-to-day management of information security team initiatives. The other members of the information security team have extensive IT, IT security and cloud industry experience, as well as certifications pertaining to information security and privacy (such as Certified Information Security Manager, Certified Information Privacy Technologist, GIAC Security Essentials and GIAC Information Security Professional certifications).

51

Our board of directors, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. The audit and risk committee of our board of directors specifically oversees critical risks and opportunities facing the Company and, in this context, reviews and provides feedback on our company-wide enterprise risk management program, which encompasses risks related to IT and cybersecurity and mitigations put in place, or to be put in place, in response to such risks and opportunities.

The audit and risk committee periodically reports to the full board of directors regarding its oversight of the Company’s enterprise risk management program and periodic risk assessment results. In addition, our board of directors receives periodic updates from our CIO and Vice President of Information Security on our ISMS and other information security initiatives, and on our information security governance framework.
