Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" and is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
Debt

On April 10, 2024, we completed the issuance and sale of $800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2032 (the "2032 Notes"). The 2032 Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 7.250% per year, payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2024. Proceeds from sale of the 2032 Notes were used (i) to redeem all of the outstanding 2025 Notes and 2027 Notes, (ii) to pay accrued interest on the Existing Notes through, but not including, April 25, 2024, (iii) to pay related fees and expenses in connection with the offering of the 2032 Notes and redemption of the Existing Notes, and (iv) for general corporate purposes, including to fund future acquisitions.

On June 20, 2024, the Company entered into the Amendment to the Credit Agreement (as define below), to provide for a new tranche of term loans under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans replace or refinance in full all of the existing term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement (as in effect immediately prior to the Amendment), all as further set forth in the Amendment. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans mature on December 19, 2030. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) the forward-looking term rate based on Term SOFR plus 2.75% per annum or (y) an alternate base rate (which will be the highest of (i) the prime rate plus 0.5% per annum above the federal funds effective rate and (ii) Term SOFR plus 1.00% per annum (which shall not be less than 1.00%) plus 1.75% per annum. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans amortize in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the aggregate original principal amount of the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans. Voluntary prepayments of the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans are permitted, in whole or in part, with prior notice, without premium or penalty.
Capital Resources 
Net working capital was approximately $495.0 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $372.0 million at December 31, 2023.
In addition to cash flows from operations and available cash, other sources of capital include amounts available on our Revolver as well as anticipated continued access to the capital markets.

Included in long-term debt obligations are principal and interest owed on our outstanding debt obligations. These amounts exclude our unamortized fair value adjustments related non-cash amortization for the Term Loan. These obligations are explained further in Note 5. "Long-Term Debt" to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We used the applicable annual interest rate as of December 31, 2024 of 7.09%, based on SOFR plus the applicable margin, for our $1.4 billion outstanding Term Loan to estimate interest payments on this variable rate debt instrument.
(2)
This reflects our future operating lease payments. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business. Substantially all of our operating lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements. These obligations are explained further in Note 6. "Leases" to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Operating lease obligations do not include common area maintenance, insurance or tax payments for which we are also obligated to pay.
Summary
Broad economic factors, including recent changes in interest rates, inflation and supply chain risks and market volatility, could negatively affect our payor mix, increase the relative proportion of lower margin services we provide and reduce patient volumes, as well as diminish our ability to collect outstanding receivables. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations, requiring an increased level of working capital.
If general economic conditions, including recent changes in interest rates, inflation risk and market volatility, continue to deteriorate or remain uncertain for an extended period of time, our ability to access capital could be harmed, which could negatively affect our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt.
Based on our current level of operations, we believe cash flows from operations, available cash, available capacity on our Revolver and continued anticipated access to capital markets, will be adequate to meet our short-term (i.e., 12 months) and long-term (beyond 12 months) liquidity needs.
Certain Non-GAAP Measures
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income or any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded from this non-GAAP metric are significant components in understanding and evaluating our financial performance. We believe such adjustments are appropriate, as the magnitude and frequency of such items can vary significantly and are not related to the assessment of normal operating performance. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to assess operating performance, make business decisions and allocate resources.

This amount includes transaction and integration costs of $100.1 million, $61.7 million and $47.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The $100.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, includes approximately $10.7 million of costs associated with evaluating strategic alternatives. This amount further includes start-up costs related to de novo surgical facilities of $7.9 million, $3.2 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

This amount also includes other litigation costs of $3.9 million, $2.5 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, the year ended December 31, 2023, includes $4.4 million related to the impact of recent changes in Florida law regarding the use of letters of protection.

This amount includes the reclassification of $7.5 million of unrealized gains out of accumulated OCI into income related to the de-designation of a portion of one of the Company's interest rate caps for the year ended December 31, 2022. This amount further includes fair value changes of undesignated derivatives for the years ended  December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, this amount includes hurricane-related impacts, net of insurance proceeds related to cyber event losses predominantly incurred in 2023.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, this amount includes estimates for the net impact of the May 2023 cyber event and losses from a divested business.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, this amount includes losses incurred, net of insurance proceeds received, related to certain surgical facilities that were closed following Hurricane Ian.
We use Credit Agreement EBITDA as a measure of liquidity and to determine our compliance under certain covenants pursuant to our New Credit Facilities. Credit Agreement EBITDA is determined on a trailing twelve-month basis. We have included it because we believe that it provides investors with additional information about our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. Credit Agreement EBITDA is not a measurement of liquidity under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any other measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded from Credit Agreement EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating our liquidity. Our calculation of Credit Agreement EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
When we use the term "Credit Agreement EBITDA," we are referring to Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, further adjusted for acquisitions and synergies. These adjustments do not relate to our historical financial performance and instead relate to estimates compiled by management and calculated in conformance with the definition of "Consolidated EBITDA" used in the credit agreements governing our credit facilities.

Inflation and changing prices have not significantly affected our operating results or the markets in which we operate.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are subject to market risk primarily from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash management activities. We utilize a balanced mix of maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates. Additionally, we periodically enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Our interest rate swap and cap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income.
Our variable rate debt instruments are primarily indexed to the prime rate or SOFR. Without derivatives, interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of our fixed rate debt portfolio due to differences in market interest rates and the rates at the inception of the debt agreements. Based on our indebtedness and the effectiveness of our interest rate swap and cap agreements at December 31, 2024, we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on our net earnings or cash flows in 2025.
For more information regarding our interest rate swap and cap agreements, please refer to Note 7. "Derivatives and Hedging Activities" to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 included elsewhere herein.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures conducted as of December 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate "internal control over financial reporting" (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with management and board authorizations; and providing reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Because of the inherent limitations in any internal control, no matter how well designed, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
We acquired a controlling interest in Midwest Orthopedic Specialty Hospital, LLC effective April 30, 2024. We excluded this facility from our assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. For the year ended December 31, 2024, this facility contributed $60.8 million or 2.0% of our total revenues, and  $303.7 million or 3.8% of our total assets.
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The assessment was based on criteria established in the framework 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)
, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. 
Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Their attestation report is included below in this Item 9A.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d‑15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Surgery Partners, Inc. 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Surgery Partners, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Surgery Partners, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
As indicated in the accompanying 
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Midwest Orthopedic Specialty Hospital, LLC, which is included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 3.8% of total assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2.0% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Midwest Orthopedic Specialty Hospital, LLC. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated March 6, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying 
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Surgery Partners, Inc. 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Surgery Partners, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also audited the disclosure of significant expenses and other segment items in Note 14 that have been disclosed for 2023 and 2022 due to the adoption of ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), 
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, 
and the recast of the segment disclosures in Note 14 to reflect one reportable segment. In our opinion, such disclosures are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2023 and 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to these disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2023 and 2022 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 6, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
F-2
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated

financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition – Contractual Allowances and Implicit Price Concessions
Description of the Matter
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s revenue was $3.1 billion. As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the transaction price for revenues is determined based on gross charges for services provided, net of estimated contractual allowances and implicit price concessions (“price concessions”). Contractual allowances are recorded at the time of payment for surgical hospitals. The estimation process is based on historical trends of cash collections and contractual write-offs. The inputs used to determine the estimated price concessions are based on objective data. Management’s determination of the estimate is complex and involves their assessment of the appropriateness and relevancy of the inputs and methodology to record the estimate.
Auditing management’s estimate of surgical hospitals' price concessions was highly judgmental due to the significant data inputs and estimation uncertainty present in determining related amounts.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the price concessions process for surgical hospitals, including controls over the review of estimated price concessions and the verification of the accuracy and completeness of the data used in the assessment.
To test the adequacy of the estimated price concessions for surgical hospitals, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used in management’s model to determine the recorded estimate. We tested the underlying data related to the recognition of patient level charges and the subsequent activities, including cash collections and contractual write-offs. We developed independent estimates of price concessions using historical collections by payor and location and compared the independent estimates to the price concession estimate developed by management. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimated price concessions as a source of potential corroborative or contrary evidence. We also considered industry, economic, and company factors to determine the appropriateness of the price concessions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Surgery Partners, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited, before the effects of the retrospective adjustments to the disclosure of significant expenses and other segment items in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements that have been disclosed for 2023 and 2022 due to the adoption of ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), 
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, and the recast of the segment disclosures in Note 14 to reflect one reportable segment, the consolidated balance sheet of Surgery Partners, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations,  comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements") (the 2023 and 2022 financial statements before the effects of the retrospective adjustments to the disclosure of significant expenses and other segment items and the recast of the segment disclosures to reflect one reportable segment in Note 14 to the financial statements are not presented herein). In our opinion, the 2023 and 2022 financial statements, before the effects of the retrospective adjustments to the disclosure of significant expenses and other segment items and the recast of the segment disclosures to reflect one reportable segment in Note 14 to the financial statements, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the disclosure of significant expenses and other segment items or the recast of the segment disclosures to reflect one reportable segment in Note 14 to the financial statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance about whether such retrospective adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. Those retrospective adjustments were audited by the successor auditor.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

SURGERY PARTNERS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  
Organization and Summary of Accounting Policies
Organization
Surgery Partners, Inc., a Delaware corporation, acting through its subsidiaries, owns and operates a national network of surgical facilities and ancillary services. The surgical facilities, which include ambulatory surgery centers ("ASCs") and surgical hospitals, primarily provide non-emergency surgical procedures across many specialties, including, among others, orthopedics and pain management, gastroenterology, ophthalmology, and general surgery. Although some of the Company's surgical hospitals may include emergency departments, they are generally not equipped to handle a broad spectrum of patient needs, including critical and traumatic injuries. Ancillary services are comprised of multi-specialty physician practices, urgent care facilities and anesthesia services. Unless the context otherwise indicates, Surgery Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries are referred to herein as "Surgery Partners," "we," "us," "our" or the "Company."
As of December 31, 2024, the Company owned or operated a portfolio of 
161
 surgical facilities, comprised of 
142
 ASCs and 
19
 surgical hospitals in 
31
 states. The Company owns these facilities in partnership with physicians and, in some cases, health care systems in the markets and communities it serves. The Company owned a majority interest in 
83
 of these surgical facilities and consolidated 
118
 surgical facilities for financial reporting purposes.
Basis of Presentation
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes. Examples include, but are not limited to, estimates of revenue, accounts receivable allowances, professional and general liabilities and the estimate of deferred tax assets or liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as interests in partnerships and limited liability companies controlled by the Company through its ownership of a majority voting interest or other rights granted to the Company by contract to manage and control the affiliate's business. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation
.
Revenues
The Company's revenues generally relate to contracts with patients in which the performance obligations are to provide health care services. The Company recognizes revenues in the period in which its obligations to provide health care services are satisfied and reports the amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive. The contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payor (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance organizations, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges) and the transaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by or negotiated with the third-party payors. The payment arrangements with third-party payors for the services provided to the related patients typically specify payments at amounts less than the Company's standard charges. The Company continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals.
The following table presents a summary of revenues by service type as a percentage of total revenues:

Patient service revenues.
  This revenue is related to charging facility fees in exchange for providing patient care. The fee charged for health care procedures performed in surgical facilities varies depending on the type of service provided, but usually includes all charges for usage of an operating room, a recovery room, special equipment, medical supplies, nursing staff and medications. The fee does not normally include professional fees charged by the patient’s surgeon, anesthesiologist or other attending physician, which are billed directly by such physicians to the patient or third-party payor. However, in several surgical facilities, the Company charges for anesthesia services. Ancillary service revenues include fees for patient visits to the Company's physician practices, pharmacy services and diagnostic tests ordered by physicians.
Patient service revenues are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. Performance obligations are based on the nature of services provided. Typically, the Company recognizes revenue at a point in time in which services are rendered and the Company has no obligation to provide further patient services. Because the Company primarily performs outpatient procedures, performance obligations are generally satisfied same day and revenue is recognized on the date of service.
F-10
Table of Contents
SURGERY PARTNERS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company determines the transaction price based on gross charges for services provided, net of estimated contractual adjustments and implicit price concessions. The Company estimates its contractual adjustments and implicit price concessions based on contractual agreements, its discount policies and historical experience of cash collections and historical write-offs. Contractual allowances are recorded at the time of payment and the time of billing for surgical hospitals and ASCs, respectively. Changes in estimated contractual adjustments and discounts are recorded in the period of change. 
Several states utilize supplemental Medicaid reimbursement programs for the purpose of providing reimbursement to providers to increase base rates to the levels that Medicare would have paid for the same service or for payments that offset a portion of the cost of providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. These programs are designed with input from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and are funded with a combination of state and federal resources, including, in certain instances, fees or taxes levied on the providers. We account for payments under these supplemental programs as variable consideration and estimate the amount using the most likely amount method. Reimbursement under these programs, including the recognition of variable consideration, is reflected in patient service revenues. Taxes or other program-related costs are reflected in other operating expenses.
Other service revenues.

 Other service revenues include management and administrative service fees derived from the non-consolidated facilities that the Company accounts for under the equity method, management of surgical facilities in which it does not own an interest, and management services provided to physician practices for which the Company is not required to provide capital or additional assets and other non-patient services. The management agreements typically require the Company to provide recurring management services over a multi-year period, which are billed and collected on a monthly basis. The fees derived from these management arrangements are based on a predetermined percentage of the revenues of each facility or practice and are recognized in the period in which management services are rendered and billed.

The following table sets forth patient service revenues by type of payor and as a percentage of total patient service revenues for the Company's consolidated surgical facilities (dollars in millions):

Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable from third-party payors are recorded net of contractual allowances and implicit price concessions, which are estimated based on established fee schedules, relationships with payors, procedure statistics and other objective information including the historical trend of cash collections and contractual write-offs. Contractual allowances are recorded at the time of payment and the time of billing for surgical hospitals and ASCs, respectively. While changes in estimated reimbursement from third-party payors remain a possibility, the Company expects that any such changes would be minimal and, therefore, would not have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
Accounts receivable consists of receivables from federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), private insurance organizations, employers and patients. Management recognizes that revenues and receivables from government agencies are significant to the Company's operations, but it does not believe that there is significant credit risk associated with these government agencies. Concentration of credit risk with respect to other payors is limited because of the large number of such payors. 
The Company recognizes that final reimbursement of accounts receivable is subject to final approval by each third-party payor. However, because the Company has contracts with its third-party payors and also verifies insurance coverage of the patient before medical services are rendered, the amounts that are pending approval from third-party payors are not considered significant. Amounts are classified outside of self-pay if the Company has an agreement with the third-party payor or has verified a patient’s coverage prior to services rendered. The Company's policy is to collect co-payments and deductibles prior to providing medical services. Patient services of the Company are primarily non-emergency, which allows the surgical facilities to control the procedures for which third-party reimbursement is sought and obtained. The Company does not require collateral from self-pay patients.
F-11
Table of Contents
SURGERY PARTNERS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company's collection policies and procedures are based on the type of payor, size of claim and estimated collection percentage for each patient account. The Company analyzes accounts receivable at each of its surgical facilities to ensure the proper collection and aged category. Collection efforts include direct contact with third-party payors or patients, written correspondence and the use of legal or collection agency assistance, as required.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets when impairment indicators are present or when circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow. The Company performs an impairment test by preparing an expected undiscounted cash flow projection. If the projection indicates that the recorded amount of the long-lived asset is not expected to be recovered, the carrying value is reduced to estimated fair value. The cash flow projection and fair value represents management’s best estimate, using appropriate and customary assumptions, projections and methodologies, at the date of evaluation.
 For discussion on impairment for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, refer to Note 4. "Goodwill and Intangible Assets."
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value and any financing elements treated as debt instruments are recorded at amortized cost. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.
The Company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.
Non-Controlling Interests
The physician limited partners and physician minority members of the entities that the Company controls are responsible for the supervision and delivery of medical services. The governance rights of limited partners and minority members are restricted to those that protect their financial interests. Under certain partnership and operating agreements governing these partnerships and limited liability companies, the Company could be removed as the sole general partner or managing member for certain events such as material breach of the partnership or operating agreement, gross negligence or bankruptcy. These protective rights do not preclude consolidation of the respective partnerships and limited liability companies.
Ownership interests in consolidated subsidiaries held by parties other than the Company are identified and generally presented in the consolidated financial statements within the equity section but separate from the Company's equity. However, in instances in which certain redemption features that are not solely within the control of the Company are present, classification of non-controlling interests outside of permanent equity is required. Consolidated net income attributable to the Company and to the non-controlling interests are identified and presented on the consolidated statements of operations; changes in ownership interests in which the Company retains a controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions assuming the Company continues to consolidate related entities. Certain transactions with non-controlling interests are classified within financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include all assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of surgical facilities in which the Company has sufficient ownership and rights to allow the Company to consolidate the surgical facilities. Similar to its investments in non-consolidated affiliates, the Company regularly engages in the purchase and sale of ownership interests with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries that do not result in a change of control. The fair value of non-controlling interests upon acquisition are determined based on certain assumptions, including Level 3 unobservable inputs. Estimates and assumptions include the projected timing and amount of future cash flows as well as discount rates reflecting inherent risk due to lack of control and marketability, among others.
Non-Controlling Interests — Redeemable. 
Each partnership and limited liability company through which the Company owns and operates its surgical facilities is governed by a partnership or operating agreement, respectively. In certain circumstances, the applicable partnership or operating agreements for the Company's surgical facilities provide that the facilities will purchase all of the physician limited partners’ or physician minority members’, as applicable, ownership if certain adverse regulatory events occur, such as it becoming illegal for the physician(s) to own an interest in a surgical facility, refer patients to a surgical facility or receive cash distributions from a surgical facility. Management believes the likelihood of an event occurring that would trigger such purchases was remote as of December 31, 2024. The non-controlling interests
—
redeemable are reported outside of stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances at high credit quality financial institutions.
Inventories
Inventories, which consist primarily of medical and drug supplies, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method.
Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates in which the Company exerts significant influence but does not control or otherwise consolidate are accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost, unless there is a deconsolidation where the investments are a result of the Company no longer having control of a previously controlled entity but still retaining a non-controlling interest. These investments are included as investments in and advances to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s share of the profits and losses from these investments is reported in income from equity investments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company monitors its investments for other-than-temporary impairment by considering factors such as current economic and market conditions and the operating performance of the investees and records reductions in carrying values when necessary.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability. The Company uses fair value measurements based on inputs classified into the following hierarchy:
•
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These may include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, depending on the nature of the item being valued.
A summary of the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's long-term debt follows (in millions):

Variable Interest Entities
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of variable interest entities ("VIE") in which the Company is the primary beneficiary under the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification 810, "
Consolidation"
. The Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact a VIE's economic performance. Additionally, the Company would absorb the majority of the expected losses from any of these entities should such expected losses occur.
 As of December 31, 2024, the Company's consolidated VIEs consisted of 
nine
 surgical facilities and 
26
 physician practices.
The total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets, net) of the consolidated VIEs included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, were $
87.0
 million and $
65.3
 million, respectively, and the total liabilities of the consolidated VIEs were $
55.0
 million and $
41.2
 million, respectively.
Professional and General and Workers' Compensation Insurance
The Company maintains general liability and professional liability insurance in excess of self-insured retentions through third party commercial insurance carriers in amounts that management believes is sufficient for the Company's operations, although, potentially, some claims may exceed the scope of coverage in effect. The professional liability insurance coverage is on a claims-made basis and the general liability insurance is on an occurrence basis. The Company also maintains workers' compensation insurance, subject to a self-insured retention.
The Company expenses the costs under the self-insured retention exposure for general and professional liability and workers' compensation claims which relate to (i) claims made during the policy period, which are offset by insurance recoveries and (ii) an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported that are expected to be reported after the policy period expires. Reserves and provisions are based upon actuarially determined estimates using individual case-basis valuations and actuarial analysis. Reserves for professional, general and workers' compensation claim liabilities are determined with no regard for expected insurance recoveries and are presented gross on the consolidated balance sheets.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which requires enhanced disclosures of significant segment expenses. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted the amendments in this ASU during the year ended December 31, 2024 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. For comparative purposes, the Company has reclassified segment disclosures previously reported to conform to current year presentation. See note 14 for additional information related to the Company's reportable segments.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740), 
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, which establishes new requirements for the categorization and disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation as well as for disaggregation of income taxes paid. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2025. The amendments in this ASU may be applied prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented and early adoption is permitted. The Company is planning to adopt in 2025 and there will be no material effect on Note 9. "Income Taxes."
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
 (Subtopic 220-40), which requires disaggregated disclosure of certain income statement line items that contain specified expense categories, such as purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization, and depletion. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our disclosures.

The Company also amended the operating agreement of a previously non-controlled surgical facility resulting in the Company obtaining a controlling interest in the facility. These transactions resulted in the consolidation of the previously non-consolidated entities. The previously held non-controlling interests were remeasured and recorded at fair value as of the dates of the transactions. The fair value measurement utilizes Level 3 inputs, which includes unobservable data. The acquisition date fair value of the previously held non-controlling interests was $
38.7
 million. As a result of increasing its ownership interest, the Company recognized a net loss of $
9.3
 million included in net loss on disposals, consolidations and deconsolidations in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. The net loss was determined based on the difference between the fair value of the Company's previously held non-controlling interests in the entities and the carrying values immediately prior to the transactions. In connection with the consolidation of these facilities, the Company preliminarily recognized non-controlling interests of $

two
 new separate entities. As a result of these transactions, the Company lost control of the previously controlled surgical facilities but retains a non-controlling interest in each, resulting in the deconsolidation of the previously consolidated entities. The remaining non-controlling interests were accounted for as equity method investments, and initially measured and recorded at fair value as of the dates of the transactions. The fair value measurement utilizes Level 3 inputs, which includes unobservable data, to measure the fair value of the retained non-controlling interests. The fair value determination was based on a combination of multiple valuation methods, which included discounted cash flow and market value approach, which incorporates estimates of future earnings and market valuation multiples for certain guideline companies. The fair value of the investments of $
9.8
 million was recorded as a component of investments in and advances to affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Further, based on the valuation, the transactions resulted in a pretax net loss on deconsolidations of $
5.6
 million, which is included in net loss on disposals, consolidations and deconsolidations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. The net loss was determined based on the difference between the fair value of the Company's retained interests in the entities and the carrying values of both the tangible and intangible assets of the entities immediately prior to the transactions.

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost or, if obtained through acquisition, at fair value determined on the date of acquisition. Depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 
20
 to 
40
 years for buildings and building improvements, 
three
 to 
five years
 for computers and software and 
five
 to 
seven years
 for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets. Routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while expenditures that increase capacities or extend useful lives are capitalized.
The Company also leases certain facilities and equipment under finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are stated at the present value of lease payments at the inception of the related lease. Such assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease term or the remaining useful life of the leased asset.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the fair value of the consideration provided in an acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired and is not amortized. 
The Company tests its goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if certain indicators arise. The Company tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. During 2024, the Company identified 
two
 reporting units, American Group and National Group.
The Company compares the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting units to the estimated fair values. To determine the fair value of the reporting units, the Company obtained valuations at the reporting unit level prepared by third-party valuation specialists which typically utilizes a combination of the income and market approaches. 
Based on the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment performed as of the October 1, 2024, it was determined that the estimated fair values of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values. A detailed evaluation of potential impairment indicators was performed, which specifically considered changes in interest rates, inflation risk and market volatility. While the Company believes that all assumptions utilized in the testing were appropriate, they may not reflect actual outcomes that could occur. Future estimates of fair value could be adversely affected if the actual outcome of one or more of the Company's assumptions changes materially in the future, including a material decline in the Company’s stock price and the fair value of its long-term debt, lower than expected surgical case volumes, higher market interest rates or increased operating costs. Such changes impacting the calculation of fair value could result in a material impairment charge in the future.
In 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were 
no
 non-cash impairment charges.

Intangible Assets
The Company has indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the certificates of need held in jurisdictions where certain of its surgical facilities are located and Medicare licenses. The Company tests these intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if certain indicators arise. The Company also has finite-lived intangible assets related to physician guarantee agreements, non-compete agreements and management rights agreements. Physician guarantees are amortized into salaries and benefits costs in the consolidated statements of operations over the commitment period of the contract, generally 
two
 to 
four years
. Non-compete agreements and management rights agreements are amortized into depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the service lives of the agreements, typically ranging from 
two
 to 
five years
 for non-compete agreements and 
15
 years for the management rights agreements.

Credit Facilities
On December 19, 2023, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which provided for a $
1.4
 billion senior secured term loan (the "Term Loan") and a $
703.8
 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolver" and, together with the Term Loan, the "Credit Facilities"). Subject to certain conditions and requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement, the Company may request one or more additional incremental term loan facilities or one or more increases in the commitments under the Revolver. 
In connection with entering the Credit Facilities, the Company terminated the then-existing senior secured credit facilities, originally dated as of August 31, 2017 and, as amended thereafter (the "2017 Credit Agreement"). Proceeds from the 2023 Term Loan were used to 
F-18
Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
repay in full the amounts previously outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement and pay fees and expenses in connection with the Credit Facilities. 
The Term Loan matures on December 19, 2030. Prior to the Amendment, as defined below, the Term Loan bore interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) the forward-looking term rate based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”) plus 
3.50
% per annum or (y) an alternate base rate (which will be the highest of (i) the prime rate plus, (ii) 
0.50
% per annum above the federal funds effective rate and (iii) Term SOFR plus 
1.00
% per annum, subject to a 
1.00
% floor) (the “Base Rate”) plus 
2.50
% per annum. 
The Term Loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments of 
0.25
% of the aggregate original principal amount outstanding on the Term Loan, which commenced on the last business day of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024. Subject to the right of reinvestment and certain other exceptions, the Term Loan requires mandatory prepayments upon the occurrence of certain events as defined in the Credit Agreement. Term Loan is also subject to an annual mandatory prepayment in an amount equal to a percentage of excess cash flow as determined based on the first lien net leverage ratio as of the last day of the applicable fiscal year.
The Revolver matures on December 19, 2028. Interest on any loans drawn under the Revolver shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) Term SOFR plus 
3.25
% per annum or (y) the Base Rate plus 
2.25
% per annum. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 
0.50
% to 
0.25
% per annum, depending on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio, in respect of unused commitments under the Revolver. The Revolver may be utilized for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, the Company's availability on the Revolver was $
501.5
 million (including outstanding letters of credit of $
10.3
 million).
With respect to the Revolver, the Company is required to comply with a maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 
5.00
:1.00, which covenant will be tested quarterly on a trailing four quarter basis only if, as of the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter the Revolver is drawn in an aggregate amount greater than 
40
% of the total commitments under the Revolver. Such financial maintenance covenant is subject to an equity cure. 
The Credit Facilities are guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by SP Holdco I, Inc. and each of Surgery Center Holdings, Inc.'s current and future wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions) (the "Subsidiary Guarantors") and are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of Surgery Center Holdings, Inc.'s, SP Holdco I, Inc.'s and the Subsidiary Guarantors’ assets (subject to certain exceptions).
The Credit Facilities includes customary negative covenants restricting or limiting the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, to, among other things, sell assets, alter its business, engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, declare dividends or redeem or repurchase equity interests, incur additional indebtedness or guarantees, make loans and investments, incur liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, prepay certain junior debt, and modify or waive certain material agreements and organizational documents, in each case, subject to customary and other agreed upon exceptions. The Credit Facilities also contain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.
In connection with the aforementioned financing transactions, the Company recorded debt issuance costs and discount of $
34.5
 million, and a debt extinguishment loss of $
15.5
 million, included in loss on debt extinguishment in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. The loss includes the partial write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts related to the prior existing term loans, and a portion of debt issuance costs incurred with entering the Credit Facilities.
Prior to the Credit Facilities, the 2017 Credit Agreement provided for a $
1.545
 billion senior secured term loan (the "2017 Term Loan") and a $
350.0
 million senior secured revolving credit facility. During 2022, the Company made a voluntary prepayment of $
150.0
 million without premium or penalty. In connection with prepayment, the Company wrote-off a portion of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, resulting in a debt extinguishment loss of $
1.0
 million, included in loss on debt extinguishment in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  
First Amendment to Credit Agreement
On June 20, 2024, the Company entered into a first amendment (the "Amendment") to its Credit Agreement, which replaced or refinanced in full all the existing term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement (as in effect immediately prior to the Amendment) (the "2024 Refinancing Term Loans"). The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans mature on December 19, 2030. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (x) the forward-looking term rate based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”) plus 
2.75
% per annum or (y) an alternate base rate (which will be the highest of (i) the prime rate plus 
0.5
% per annum above the federal funds effective rate and (ii) Term SOFR plus 
1.00
% per annum (which shall not be less than 
1.00
%)) plus 
1.75
% per annum. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans amortize in equal quarterly installments of 
0.25
% of the aggregate original principal amount of the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans. Voluntary prepayments of the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans are permitted, in whole or in part, with prior notice, without premium or penalty (except a 
1.00
% call premium in the case of certain repricing events occurring prior to the sixth month anniversary of the effective date of the Amendment).

Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use assets represent the right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term, which includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. When readily determinable, the Company uses the interest rate implicit in a lease to determine the present value of future lease payments. For leases where the implicit rate is not readily determinable, the Company's incremental borrowing rate is used. The Company calculates its incremental borrowing rate on a periodic basis using a third-party financial model that estimates the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the total lease payments on a collateralized basis over a term similar to the lease. The Company applies its incremental borrowing rate using a portfolio approach. The right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options.
The Company's operating leases are primarily for real estate, including medical office buildings, and corporate and other administrative offices. The Company's finance leases are primarily for medical equipment and information technology and telecommunications assets. The Company's finance leases also include certain land, buildings and improvements as discussed in Note 3. "Property and Equipment." Real estate lease agreements typically have initial terms of 
ten years
 and may include 
one
 or more options to renew. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. The useful life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. The majority of the

SURGERY PARTNERS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Company's medical equipment leases have a bargain purchase option that is reasonably certain of exercise, so these assets are depreciated over their useful life. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants.
Certain of the Company's lease agreements require the Company to pay common area maintenance, repairs, property taxes and insurance costs, which are variable amounts based on actual costs incurred during each applicable period. Certain lease agreements also include escalating rent payments that are not fixed at commencement but are based on an index that is determined in future periods over the lease term based on changes in the Consumer Price Index or other measure of cost inflation. These variable components of lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included in the determination of the right-of-use asset or lease liability.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and interest rate caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. During 2024 and 2023, such derivatives have been used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
three
 interest rate swaps with a total net notional amount of $
1.2
 billion. The interest rate swaps are pay-fixed, receive 1-Month SOFR (subject to a minimum of 
0.75
%) designated in cash flow hedging relationships and have a termination date of March 31, 2025. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
two
 interest rate caps designated in cash flow hedging relationships with a total notional amount of $
151.8
 million. The interest rate caps each have a termination date of March 31, 2025. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company partially terminated a previously undesignated portion of one of its interest rate caps. In connection with the termination, the Company received $
8.6
 million, which is included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023.
On April 9, 2024, the Company entered into 
five
 deferred premium interest rate cap agreements, each with an effective date of March 31, 2025. The deferred premium interest rate caps are designated in cash flow hedging relationships with a total notional amount of $
1.4
 billion. The deferred premium interest rate caps each have a termination date of December 31, 2028. These financial instruments are designed to limit the Company's interest rate exposure on its term loan concurrent with the expected maturity of positions held as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company's deferred premium interest rate caps had a total notional amount of $
1.4
 billion. 
The pay-fixed, receive floating interest rate swaps did not meet the requirements to be considered derivatives in their entirety as a result of the financing component. Accordingly, the swaps are considered hybrid instruments, consisting of a financing element treated as a debt instrument and an embedded at-market derivative that was designated as a cash flow hedge. 
Within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, the financing elements treated as debt instruments described above are carried at amortized cost and the embedded at-market derivatives are recorded at fair value. The cash flows related to the portion treated as debt are classified as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows while the portion treated as an at-market derivative are classified as operating activities. Within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, the interest rate caps are recorded at fair value. The cash flows related to the interest rate caps are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
The Company's interest rate swap agreements, excluding the portion treated as debt, are recognized at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and are valued using pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curve data, which are classified as Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the interest rate caps is determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the caps are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. The interest rate caps are classified using Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy.
For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI") and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings, as documented at hedge inception in accordance with the Company’s accounting policy election. Amounts reported in accumulated OCI related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. Over the next 12 months, the Company estimates that an additional $
6.7
 million will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense.

Equity-Based Compensation
Equity-based awards are granted pursuant to the Surgery Partners, Inc. 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective January 1, 2020 ("2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan"). Under this plan, the Company can grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, unrestricted stock, stock units, performance awards, cash awards and other awards convertible into or otherwise based on shares of its common stock. As of December 31, 2024, 
11,815,700
 shares were authorized to be granted under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan and 
3,553,509
 were available for future equity grants. 
The terms of equity-based awards, including vesting conditions, are determined by the Compensation Committee and set forth in the applicable award agreements at the time of issuance. In general, vesting is contingent upon either a service, performance or market condition (or a combination thereof). Accelerated vesting for earned shares may occur upon certain terminating events, including a change in control of the Company. 
The Company measures the fair value of equity-based awards on the date of grant, with associated compensation costs recognized over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures as they occur. The Company’s policy is to recognize compensation expense using the straight line method over the relevant vesting period for units that vest based on time.
Restricted and Performance Share-Based Awards
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company granted restricted stock awards ("RSAs") of 
410,057
 and 
505,787
, respectively, to certain officers, employees and non-employee directors in accordance with the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. In general, RSAs vest ratably over a 
one
 to 
three
-year service period, contingent upon continued employment or service to the Company. 
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs") of 
399,745
 and 
334,275
, respectively, which were subject to the achievement of various performance conditions. The performance period for these PSUs is generally 
one year
 from the date of grant, with ratable vesting continuing for 
two years
 from the earned date or 
three years
 after the the date of grant with a one-time cliff vesting. In addition to the achievement of the performance conditions, these PSUs are generally subject to the continuing service of the employee over the vesting periods. For certain PSUs awarded to officers of the Company, the number of shares payable at the end of the performance periods ranges from 
0
% to 
300
% of the targeted units based on the Company’s actual performance results and/or market conditions as compared to the targets. 
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
123,742
 and 
74,123
 of the PSUs previously granted were deemed to have been earned, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies
Professional, General and Workers' Compensation and Cyber Liability Risks
The Company is subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business, including claims relating to patient treatment, employment practices and personal injuries. The Company maintains professional, general and workers' compensation and cyber liability insurance in excess of self-insured retentions, through third party commercial insurance carriers. Although management believes the coverage is sufficient for the Company's operations, some claims may potentially exceed the scope of coverage in effect. Plaintiffs in these matters may request punitive or other damages that may not be covered by insurance. The Company is not aware of any such proceedings that are reasonably possible to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Total professional, general and workers' compensation claim liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $
19.2
 million and $
18.2
 million, respectively. Expected insurance recoveries of $
9.6
 million and $
10.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included as a component of other current assets and other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 
In May 2023, we experienced a cybersecurity incident that temporarily disrupted certain facilities in our Idaho market. We estimate that this incident had an adverse pre-tax impact of approximately $
8
 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. This estimate includes lost revenue from the associated business interruption and other related expenses. We have filed a claim with the insurance carrier related to this incident. Insurance recoveries of $
6.5
 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 with 
no
 comparable activity in the prior year.

Laws and Regulations
Laws and regulations governing the Company's business, including those relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, are complex and subject to interpretation. These laws and regulations govern every aspect of how the Company's surgical facilities conduct their operations, from licensing requirements to how and whether the Company's facilities may receive payments pursuant to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government agency review and interpretation as well as legislative changes to such laws. Noncompliance with such laws and regulations may subject the Company to significant regulatory sanctions including fines, penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. From time to time, governmental regulatory agencies will conduct inquiries of the Company's practices, including, but not limited to, the Company's compliance with federal and state fraud and abuse laws, billing practices and relationships with physicians.
Stockholder Litigation
On December 4, 2017, a purported Company stockholder filed an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the "Delaware Action"). That action is captioned Witmer v. H.I.G. Capital, L.L.C., et al., C.A. No. 2017-0862. The plaintiff in the Delaware Action asserted claims against (i) certain current and former members of the Company’s Board of Directors (together, the "Directors"); (ii) H.I.G. Capital, LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "H.I.G."); and (iii) Bain Capital Private Equity, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "Bain Capital" and, together with the Directors and H.I.G., the "Defendants"). The parties to the Delaware Action negotiated a final stipulation of
settlement (the “Settlement Stipulation”), which governs the terms of the settlement of the Delaware Action, and which they filed with the Court of Chancery on November 22, 2021. On February 11, 2022, the Court of Chancery approved the settlement of the Delaware Action as memorialized in the Settlement Stipulation. That decision became final and non-appealable on March 14, 2022. The case is now closed. Pursuant to the settlement, the Company received $
32.8
 million in March 2022, which was included in litigation settlements in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Acquired Facilities
The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries or controlled partnerships and limited liability companies, has acquired and will continue to acquire surgical facilities with prior operating histories. Such facilities may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with health care laws and regulations, such as billing and reimbursement laws and regulations, the federal physician self-referral law, or Stark Law, the statute commonly known as the federal Anti-Kickback statute, the federal False Claims Act, and similar fraud and abuse laws. Although the Company attempts to assure that no such liabilities exist, obtain indemnification from prospective sellers covering such matters and institute policies designed to conform centers to its standards following completion of acquisitions, there can be no assurance that the Company will not become liable for past activities that may later be asserted to be improper by private plaintiffs or government agencies. There can be no assurance that any such matter will be covered by indemnification or, if covered, that the liability sustained will not exceed contractual limits or the financial capacity of the indemnifying party.
The Company cannot predict whether federal or state statutory or regulatory provisions will be enacted that would prohibit or otherwise regulate relationships which the Company has established or may establish with other health care providers or have materially adverse effects on its business or revenues arising from such future actions. Management believes, however, that it will be able to adjust the Company's operations so as to be in compliance with any statutory or regulatory provision as may be applicable.
Potential Physician Investor Liability
A majority of the physician investors in the partnerships and limited liability companies which operate the Company's surgical facilities carry general and professional liability insurance on a claims-made basis. Each partnership or limited liability company may, however, be liable for damages to persons or property arising from occurrences at the surgical facilities. Although the various physician investors and other surgeons generally are required to obtain general and professional liability insurance with tail coverage that extends beyond the period of any claims-made policies, such individuals may not be able to obtain coverage in amounts sufficient to cover all potential liability. Since most insurance policies contain exclusions, the physician investors will not be insured against all possible occurrences. In the event of an uninsured or underinsured loss, the value of an investment in the partnership interests or limited liability company membership units and the amount of distributions could be adversely affected.
14.  
Segment Reporting
Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our CEO, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), manages our segments, evaluates financial results, and makes key operating decisions. We have 
one
 reportable segment: Surgical Facilities. 
The Surgical Facilities reportable segment is comprised of 
two
 operating segments, which we have aggregated to a single reportable segment in consideration of the aggregation criteria set forth in ASC 280.
The Surgical Facilities reportable segment includes the operation of ASCs, surgical hospitals, anesthesia services, and multi-specialty physician practices, which earns revenues primarily from contracts with patients in which the performance obligations are to provide health care services. The "All other" line item primarily consists of amounts attributable to the Company's corporate general and administrative functions. The Company defines its segment on the basis of the way in which its internally reported financial information is regularly reviewed by the CODM to assess performance and allocate resources.

Table of Contents
SURGERY PARTNERS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the operating segment previously defined as "Ancillary services" was included with Surgical Facilities based on changes in the operational management of our multi-specialty physician practices. Accordingly, the Company has reclassified segment disclosures previously reported to conform to current year presentation.
The Company’s CODM uses Adjusted EBITDA to assess performance and allocate resources. The CODM considers budget-to-actual and actual versus prior period variances on a periodic basis as a means of assessing performance.
