Market Information for Common Stock
Our common stock trades under the symbol "SGRY" on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. 
Stockholders
As of February 24, 2025, there were 193 holders of record of our common stock. The actual number of common stockholders is greater than the number of record holders, and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees. This number of holders of record also does not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities. 
Dividends
We have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock, and we have no current plans to declare or pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of our or our subsidiaries' existing or future indebtedness, including our existing credit facility. Additionally, because we are a holding company, we would depend on distributions from our subsidiaries to fund any potential dividends.

The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, the Company continued to have authority to repurchase up to $46.0 million of shares of common stock under the share repurchase program.
