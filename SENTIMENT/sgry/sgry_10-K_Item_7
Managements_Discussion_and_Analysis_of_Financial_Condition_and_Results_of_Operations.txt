Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report") contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions about future events. All statements other than statements of current or historical fact contained in this report, including statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected costs and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words "projections," "believe," "continue," "drive," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "will," "could," "would" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements.
By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We believe that these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in the "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report, which include but are not limited to the following: 
•
reductions in payments from government health care programs and private insurance payors, such as health maintenance organizations ("HMOs"), preferred provider organizations ("PPOs"), and other managed care organizations and employers;
•
our ability to contract with private insurance payors;
•
changes in our payor mix or surgical case mix;
•
failure to maintain or develop relationships with physicians on beneficial or favorable terms, or at all;
•
our efforts to integrate operations of acquired businesses and surgical facilities, attract new physician partners, or acquire additional surgical facilities;
•
supply chain issues, including shortages or quality control issues with surgery-related products, equipment and medical supplies;
•
competition for physicians, nurses, strategic relationships, acquisitions and managed care contracts;
•
our ability to attract and retain qualified health care professionals; 
•
our ability to manage material liabilities whether known or unknown incurred as a result of acquiring surgical facilities;
•
the impact of future legislation and other health care regulatory reform actions, and the effect of that legislation and other regulatory actions on our business;
•
our ability to comply with current health care laws and regulations;
•
the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings that have been or may be brought against us;
•
the impact of cybersecurity attacks or intrusions;
•
changes in the regulatory, economic and other conditions of the states where our surgical facilities are located; 
•
our indebtedness; and
•
the social and economic impact of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease on our business. 
Although we have based these forward-looking statements on our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs, we caution you that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. They can be affected by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, the risks, uncertainties and assumptions described in Item 1A. "Risk Factors."
Any forward-looking statements and other information set forth in this Annual Report speak only as of the date made. Other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, press releases, investor presentations and our website.
