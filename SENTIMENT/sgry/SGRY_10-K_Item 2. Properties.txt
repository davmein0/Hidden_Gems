Item 2. Properties
Our corporate headquarters is located in Brentwood, Tennessee, where we currently lease approximately 29,670 square feet of office space pursuant to an agreement with an initial term expiring December 31, 2027. Our surgical facilities typically are located on real estate leased by the partnership or limited liability company that operates the facility. Of our 161 surgical facilities, 157 utilize leased real property. These leases generally have initial terms of 10 years, but range from 2 to 15 years. Most of the leases contain options to extend the lease period for up to 10 additional years. We generally guarantee the lease obligations of the partnerships and LLCs that own our surgical facilities. We expect to be able to renew or replace a substantial majority of these leases on substantially similar terms as they come due. Most of our ASCs range in size from 8,000 to 12,000 square feet and are specifically tailored to meet the needs of physician-partners and their specialties. We believe these spaces are sufficient and adequate for our needs at this time.
