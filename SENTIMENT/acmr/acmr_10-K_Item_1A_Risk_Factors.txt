Item 1A. Risk Factors–Regulatory Risks–Mainland China’s currency exchange control and government restrictions on investment repatriation may impact our ability to transfer funds outside of mainland China, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business, otherwise fund and conduct our business, or pay dividends on our common stock.”
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, with the exception of sales and services-related transfer-pricing payments in the ordinary course of business, and dividends paid by ACM Shanghai to ACM Research, no transfers or distributions have been made between ACM Research, and its subsidiaries, including ACM Shanghai, or to holders of ACM Research Class A common stock.
Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2024 were held for working capital purposes and other potential investments. ACM Shanghai, our only direct mainland China subsidiary, is, however, subject to mainland China restrictions on distributions to equity holders. The use of proceeds raised by the STAR Market IPO, without further approvals, are limited to specific usage. We currently intend for ACM Shanghai to retain all available funds from any

future earnings for use in the operation of its business and do not anticipate it paying any cash dividends. Our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period, which affects our cash flow from operating activities. Fluctuations vary depending on cash collections, client mix, and the timing of shipment and acceptance of our tools.
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support the operation of and to finance the growth and development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Contractual Obligations
Grant Contract for State-owned Construction Land Use Right in Shanghai City
In 2020 ACM Shanghai, through its wholly-owned subsidiary ACM Lingang, entered into a Grant Contract for State-owned Construction Land Use Right in Shanghai City (Category of R&D Headquarters and Industrial Projects), or the Grant Agreement, with the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone Lin-gang Special Area Administration, or the Grantor. ACM Lingang obtained rights to use approximately 43,000 square meters (10.6 acres) of land in the East China Silicon Hub of Lin-gang Special Area of China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, or the Land Use Right, for a period of fifty years, commencing on the date of delivery of the land in July 2020, which we refer to as the Delivery Date.
In exchange for its land use rights, ACM Lingang paid aggregate grant fees of RMB 61.7 million ($9.5 million), or the Grant Fees, and a performance deposit of RMB 12.3 million ($1.9 million), which is equal to 20% of the aggregate Grant Fees, to secure its achievement of the following performance milestones:
•
the start of construction within 6 months after the Delivery Date (60% of the performance deposit), or Construction Start Milestone;
•
the completion of construction within 30 months after the Delivery Date (20% of the performance deposit), or Construction Completion Milestone; and
•
the start of production within 42 months after the Delivery Date (20% of the performance deposit), or Production Start Milestone.
Upon satisfaction of a milestone, the portion of the performance deposit attributable to that milestone will be repayable to ACM Lingang within ten business days. If the achievement of any of the above milestones is delayed or abandoned, ACM Lingang may be subject to additional penalties and may lose its rights to both the use of the granted land and any partially completed facilities on that land.
The status of the performance milestones for the period ended December 31, 2024 is as follows:
•
ACM Lingang achieved the Construction Start Milestone and 60% of the performance deposit was refunded to ACM Shanghai in 2020.
•
We expect that the Lin-gang Special Area Administration, with supplementary land grant contracts, will adjust certain performance terms, including extension of the Construction Completion and Production Start milestones.
•
The Construction Completion Milestone was required to be met by January 9, 2024 but was not achieved.  ACM Lingang believes it will receive the refund without penalty, however, based on extensions expected 
73
Table of Contents
in the supplementary land grant contracts. We cannot guarantee that ACM Lingang will achieve the missed milestone, or even if it does achieve the milestone in 2025, that it will be refunded some or all of the 20% portion of the performance deposit of RMB 2.5 million ($0.4 million).
Contractual penalties in the case of a delay of Construction Completion Milestone
:
◦
If ACM Lingang fails to complete the construction pursuant to the date agreed under the Grant Agreement or any extended completion date approved by the Grantor, ACM Lingang shall pay 50% of the deposit for timely completion of construction as liquidated damages;
◦
If ACM Lingang delays the completion for more than six months beyond the date agreed under the Grant Agreement, or beyond any extended completion date approved by the Grantor, it shall pay the total deposit for timely completion of construction as liquidated damages.
◦
If the delay is more than one year, the Grantor is entitled to terminate the Grant Agreement and take back the Land Use Right. In such case, the Grantor shall refund the Grant Fees for the remaining land use term after deducting the deposit agreed under the Grant Agreement and refund the deposit for timely commencement of production and relevant bank interests in full to ACM Lingang.
•
The Production Start Milestone, as extended due to COVID-19 related delays, was required to be met by January 23, 2025 but was not achieved. ACM Lingang believes it will receive the refund without penalty, however, based on extensions expected in the supplementary land grant contracts. We cannot guarantee that ACM Lingang will meet any extended deadline or be refunded this 20% portion of the performance deposit.
Contractual penalties in the case of a delay of Production Start Milestone
:
◦
If ACM Lingang fails to commence production pursuant to the date agreed under the Grant Agreement or any extended commencement date approved by the Grantor, ACM Lingang shall pay the total deposit for timely commencement of production as liquidated damages;
◦
If ACM Lingang fails to commence production pursuant to the extended commencement of production date (more than six months beyond the production start milestone), the Grantor is entitled to terminate the Grant Agreement and take back the Land Use Right. In such case, the Grantor shall refund the Grant Fees for the remaining land use term after deducting the deposit agreed under the Grant Agreement to ACM Lingang.
In addition to the milestones, covenants in the current Agreement require that, among other things, ACM Lingang will be required to pay liquidated damages in the event that 
within seven years after the Delivery Date, or prior to July 9, 2027, it does
 not (i) generate a minimum specified amount of annual sales of products manufactured on the granted land or (ii) pay at least RMB 157.6 million ($22.2 million) in annual total taxes (including value-added taxes, corporate income tax, personal income taxes, urban maintenance and construction taxes, education surcharges, stamp taxes, and vehicle and shipping taxes) as a result of operations in connection with the granted land.
If the total tax revenue of the project fails to reach but is no less than 80% of the standard agreed under the Grant Agreement, ACM Lingang shall pay 20% of the actual shortfall amount of the tax revenue as liquidated damages. If the total tax revenue of the project fails to reach 80% of the standard agreed under the Grant Agreement within 1 month after the agreed date of reaching target production, the Grantor is entitled to terminate the Grant Agreement, take back the Land Use Right, and shall refund the Grant Fees for the remaining land use term to ACM Lingang.
If the Grant Agreement is terminated because of breach of any terms above, the Grantor shall take back the buildings, fixtures and auxiliary facilities on the land area and provide ACM Lingang with corresponding compensation according to the residual value of the buildings, fixtures and auxiliary facilities when they are taken back.
The total cumulative investment of land, buildings and construction in progress related to ACM Lingang amounted to $156.2 million and $116.9 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
How We Evaluate Our Operations
We present information below with respect to four measures of financial performance:
•
We define “shipments” of tools to include (a) a “repeat” delivery to a customer of a type of tool that the customer has previously accepted, for which we recognize revenue upon delivery, and (b) a “first-time” delivery of a “first 
74
Table of Contents
tool” to a customer on an approval basis, for which we may recognize revenue in the future if contractual conditions are met, or if a purchase order is received.
•
We define “adjusted EBITDA” as net income excluding interest expense (net), income tax benefit (expense), depreciation and amortization, unrealized (gain) loss on short-term investments, and stock-based compensation. We define adjusted EBITDA to also exclude restructuring costs, although we have not incurred any such costs to date.
•
We define “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment (net of proceeds from disposals).
•
We define “adjusted operating income (loss)” as our income (loss) from operations excluding stock-based compensation.
These financial measures are not based on any standardized methodologies prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.
We have presented shipments, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted operating income (loss) because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, to establish budgets and to develop operational goals for managing our business. We believe that these financial measures help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the expenses eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss) can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our core operating performance and that the exclusion of property and equipment purchases from operating cash flow can provide a usual means to gauge our capability to generate cash. Accordingly, we believe that these financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.
Shipments, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and adjusted operating income (loss) are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Shipments
We consider shipments a key operating metric as it reflects the total value of products delivered to customers and prospective customers by our productive assets.
Shipments consist of two components:
•
a shipment made to a customer that have previously accepted a specific type of tool (“repeat shipments”), revenues are recognized upon shipment or delivery because the Company can objectively demonstrate that the tools meet all the required customer specifications; and
•
a shipment to a customer of a type of tool that the customer is receiving and evaluating for the first time, in each case a “first tool,” for which we may recognize revenue at a later date, subject to the customer’s acceptance of the tool upon the tool’s satisfaction of applicable contractual requirements or subject to the customer’s subsequent discretionary commitment to purchase the tool.
“First tool” shipments can be made to either an existing customer that has not previously accepted that specific type of tool in the past ─ for example, a delivery of a SAPS V tool to a customer that previously had received only SAPS II tools ─ or to a new customer that has never purchased any tool from us.
Shipments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 t
otaled $973 million, $596 million, and $539 million,  respectively. Repeat tool shipments in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 totaled $505 million, 
$310 million, and $288 million, respectively. First tool shipments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 totaled $468 million, $286 million, and $251 million, respectively.
The dollar amount attributed to a “first tool” shipment is equal to the consideration we expect to receive if any and all contractual requirements are satisfied and the customer accepts the tool, or if the customer subsequently determines in its discretion to purchase the tool. There are a number of limitations related to the use of shipments in evaluating our business, including that customers have significant, or in some cases total, discretion in determining whether to accept or purchase our tools after evaluation and their decision not to accept or purchase delivered tools is likely to result in our inability to 
75
Table of Contents
recognize revenue from the delivered tools. “First tool” shipments reflect the value of incremental new products under evaluation delivered to our customers or prospective customers for a given period and is used as an internal key metric to reflect future potential revenue opportunity. The cumulative cost of “first tool” shipments under evaluation at customers which have not been accepted by the customer is carried at cost and reflected in finished goods inventory (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report). “First tool” shipments exclude deliveries to customers for which ACM does not have a basis to expect future revenue.
Adjusted EBITDA
There are a number of limitations related to the use of adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), which is the nearest GAAP equivalent. Some of these limitations are:
•
adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future;
•
we exclude stock-based compensation expense from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss), although (a) it has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy and (b) if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, the cash salary expense included in operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position;
•
the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results;
•
adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;
•
adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt;
•
adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax expense (benefit) or the cash requirements to pay taxes;
•
adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•
although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
•
adjusted EBITDA includes expense reductions and non-operating other income attributable to mainland China governmental grants, which may mask the effect of underlying developments in net income, including trends in current expenses and interest expense, and free cash flow includes the mainland China governmental grants, the amount and timing of which can be difficult to predict and are outside our control.

The $70.4 million increase in adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily reflected an increase in net income, an increase in income tax expense, and an increase in stock-based compensation.
We do not exclude from adjusted EBITDA expense reductions and non-operating other income attributable to mainland China governmental grants because we consider and incorporate the expected amounts and timing of those grants in incurring expenses and capital expenditures. If we did not receive the grants, our cash expenses therefore would be lower, and our cash position would not be affected, to the extent we have accurately anticipated the amounts of the grants. For additional information regarding our mainland China grants, please see “—Key Components of Results of Operations—mainland China Government Research and Development Funding.”

The changes in free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 reflected the factors driving net cash used in operating activities, and an increase of purchases of property and equipment. Consistent with our methodology for calculating adjusted EBITDA, we do not adjust free cash flow for the effects of mainland China government subsidies, because we take those subsidies into account in incurring expenses and capital expenditures. We do not adjust free cash flow for the effects of time-deposits, which for our internal purposes are considered as largely similar to cash.
Adjusted Operating Income
Adjusted operating income excludes stock-based compensation from income from operations. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, determining the fair value of certain of the stock-based instruments we utilize involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards. Furthermore, unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options, which is an element of our ongoing stock-based compensation expense, is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond our control. Management believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. The use of non-GAAP financial measures excluding stock-based compensation has limitations. If we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, the cash salary expense included in 
77

operating expenses would be higher and our cash holdings would be less. The following tables reflect the exclusion of stock-based compensation, or SBC, from line items comprising income from operations:

Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2023, increased by $77.4 million due to a $55.2 million increase in income from operations and a $22.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by $56.4 million due to a $36.8 million increase in income from operations and a $19.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. 
Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
As a result of our operating, investing and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. We are also exposed to credit risk as a result of our normal business activities.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency, while the functional currency of our subsidiaries in mainland China is RMB, and the functional currency of our subsidiary in Korea is the Korean Won, or the KRW. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. Any difference between the initially recorded amount and the settlement amount is recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency transaction in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the functional currency rate of exchange as of the date of a consolidated balance sheet. Any difference is recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency translation in the appropriate consolidated statement of operations. In accordance with ASC Topic 830, 
Foreign Currency Matters
, we translate the assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars from RMB using the rate of exchange prevailing at the applicable balance sheet date and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows are translated at an average rate during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded in stockholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
The majority of our business is conducted through our ACM Shanghai subsidiary that manufactures and sells our products in various global markets, and we also have operations in Korea, the Taiwan Region, the United States, and other countries. We sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated in U.S. dollars; however, we purchase raw materials, pay wages, and make payments to our supply chain in foreign currencies, primarily RMB, and also the KRW. As a result, our earnings, cash flows and cash balances are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, because of our significant manufacturing operations in mainland China, a weakening RMB is advantageous and a strengthening RMB is disadvantageous to our financial results. At this time, we have not established a formal hedging

policy to attempt to reduce the inherent risks of potential currency fluctuations on our global operations. We report the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations in the other income (expense) line item of our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) statements. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, the effect of fluctuations of foreign currencies contributed realized gains (losses) of $4.2 million, (2.0)  million, and $1.7 million, respectively.
The mainland China government imposes significant exchange restrictions on fund transfers out of mainland China that are not related to business operations. To date these restrictions have not had a material impact on us because we have not engaged in any significant transactions that are subject to the restrictions.
Interest Rate Risk
As of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the balance of our short term bank borrowings (see note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”), mature at various dates within the following year and do not expose us to interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of our long-term borrowings (see note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”) carries a fixed interest rated and we may be exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
We have implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are reviewed regularly by management and the board of directors. We identify risk exposures and monitor and manage such risks on an ongoing basis.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of ACM Research, Inc. 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ACM Research, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
Revenue Recognition
Description of the Matter
As described in Notes 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from tools and spare parts at a point in time, when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation. For shipments made to a customer that has not previously accepted a specific type of tool (“first tools”), revenues are recognized when the tools are accepted by the customer. For shipments made to a customer that have previously accepted a specific type of tool (“repeat shipments”), revenues are recognized upon shipment or delivery because the Company can objectively demonstrate that the tools meet all the required customer specifications.
Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence to validate whether the Company can objectively identify repeat shipments required auditor judgment and significant audit effort because the Company’s tools are highly customized for each customer.
81
Table of Contents
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s revenue process. For example, we tested the controls over management’s review of the Company’s analysis to determine whether the repeat shipments identified have been previously accepted by the same customer.
To test whether the Company can objectively demonstrate that the highly customized tools are repeat shipments, our audit procedures, among others, included performing direct inquiries with the Company’s personnel from its sales and engineering department to understand the Company’s process of identifying repeat shipments and the quality control department to understand the quality control process. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed by testing all the sales transactions identified as repeat shipments during the year.  Specifically for all repeat shipments, we inspected the quality control reports signed by the Company’s quality control department. We also identified the similar tools previously sold to and accepted by the same customer by comparing the executed contracts or purchase orders of both tools, and inspected the acceptance confirmation from the customer of the previous tools to verify that the Company was able to objectively demonstrate that repeat shipments meet all the required customer specifications with its established history of customer acceptance. We evaluated the overall sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed over repeat shipments, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of audit effort.

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of ACM Research, Inc. 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited ACM Research, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, ACM Research, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 2 – 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ACM and its subsidiaries, including ACM Shanghai and its subsidiaries. ACM’s subsidiaries are those entities in which ACM, directly and indirectly, controls more than a majority of the voting power. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).

Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year’s presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported revenues and expenses during the reported period in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company’s significant accounting estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, those used for revenue recognition and deferred revenue, the valuation and recognition of fair value of certain long-term investments, stock-based compensation arrangements, realization of deferred tax assets, uncertain tax position, assessment for impairment of long-lived assets and long-term investments, allowance for credit losses, inventory valuation, useful lives of property, plant and equipment and useful lives of intangible assets.
Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and bank deposits that are unrestricted as to withdrawal and use, and highly liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less at the date of purchase. At times, cash deposits may exceed government-insured limits.
The following table presents cash and cash equivalents, according to jurisdiction as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:

The amounts in mainland China do not include short-term and long-term time deposits which in aggregate totaled $
30,552
 and $
121,342
 at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Cash held in the U.S. exceeds the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits and is subject to risk of loss. No losses have been experienced to date.
Cash amounts at the banks in mainland China are subject to a series of risk control regulatory standards from mainland China bank regulatory authorities. ACM’s subsidiaries in mainland China are required to obtain approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) to transfer funds into or out of mainland China. SAFE requires a valid agreement to approve the transfers, which are processed through a bank. Other than these mainland China foreign exchange restrictions, ACM’s subsidiaries in mainland China are not subject to any mainland China restrictions and limitations on its ability to transfer funds to ACM Research or among our other subsidiaries. However, cash held by ACM’s subsidiaries in mainland China does exceed applicable insurance limits and is subject to risk of loss, although no such losses have been experienced to date.

Accounts Receivable, Net
Prior to adoption of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
 (“ASC 326”), the Company reviews its accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. After adoption of ASC 326, as of January 1, 2023, the Company assesses collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when the Company identifies specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, the Company considers historical collectability based on past due status, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company’s customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect the Company’s ability to collect from customers.
 At December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company, based on a review of its outstanding balances and its customers, determined the allowance for credit losses were $
18,347
 and $
4,830
, respectively.
Inventories, Net
Inventory consists of raw materials and related goods, work-in-progress, finished goods, and other consumable materials such as spare parts. Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of inventory is principally 
92
Table of Contents
determined by the weighted average cost method for raw materials. The Company assesses the recoverability of all inventories to determine if any adjustments are required for obsolete inventory or those with net realizable value lower than the cost.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation begins when the asset is placed in service and is calculated by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of an asset (or, if shorter, over the lease term). Betterments or renewals are capitalized when incurred. 
Estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:
Buildings and plants 
30
 years
Computer and office equipment
3
 to 
5
 years
Furniture and fixtures
5
 years
Leasehold improvements
shorter of lease term or estimated useful life
Electronic equipment
3
 to 
5
 years
Manufacturing equipment
for small to medium-sized equipment, 
5
 to 
10
 years; for large equipment,
estimated by purchasing department at time of acceptance
Transportation equipment
4
 to 
5
 years
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong the life of the property are charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or sale of an asset, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income.
Construction In Progress
Construction in progress primarily reflects costs incurred related to the construction of ACM Shanghai’s Lingang development and production center.

Intangible Assets, Net
Intangible assets consist of purchase software. Assets are valued at cost at the time of acquisition and are amortized over their beneficial periods.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful life of the assets is shorter than the Company had originally estimated. When these events or changes occur, the Company evaluates the impairment of the long-lived assets by comparing the carrying value of the assets to an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value.

Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company uses the 
93
Table of Contents
implicit rate when readily determinable. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has also elected the practical expedient for the short-term lease exemption for contracts with lease terms of 12 months or less. The Company has also elected the practical expedient for the short-term lease exemption for contracts with lease terms of 12 months or less.
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives revenue principally from the sale of semiconductor capital equipment. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized using the following five steps pursuant ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
:
1.
Identify the contract(s) with a customer;
2.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
3.
Determine the transaction price;
4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
5.
Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
Identify the contract(s) with a customer.
 The Company generally considers written documentation including, but not limited to, signed purchase orders, master agreements, and sales orders as contracts, provided it has approval and commitment from the customer, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collection is probable. Collectability is assessed based on management’s assessment of the customer’s creditworthiness, historical payment experience, as well as other relevant factors.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 
Performance obligations are accounted for separately if they are distinct. A good or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and the good or service is distinct in the context of the contract.

The Company’s performance obligations generally include sales of tools and spare parts. In addition, customer contracts can contain provisions for installation, training, software updates, most-favored pricing for spare parts, and other items which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract.
Determine the transaction price. 
The transaction price for the Company’s contracts with customers may include fixed and variable consideration. The Company includes variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur in the future based on the Company’s historical experience with similar arrangements. 
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 
For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, primarily those that include multiple tools, or spare parts sold together with tools, the Company allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company recognizes contract liabilities associated with unsatisfied performance obligations, based on the stand-alone observable selling prices or using an expected cost-plus-margin approach when a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, and recognizes revenue as the related performance obligations are satisfied.
Recognize revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied
. The Company recognizes revenue from tools and spare parts at a point in time, when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation. The Company’s sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. For shipments made to a customer that has not previously accepted a specific type of tool (“first tools”), revenues are recognized when the tools are accepted by the customer. For shipments made to a customer that has previously accepted a specific type of tool ("repeat shipment"), revenues are recognized upon shipment or delivery because the Company can objectively demonstrate that the tools meet all the required customer specifications.
The Company’s warranties provide assurance that its products will function as expected and in accordance with certain specifications. The Company’s warranties are intended to safeguard the customer against existing defects and do not provide any incremental service to the customer. They are not separate performance obligations and are accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 
460, Guarantees
. 
For sales of tools, payment terms and conditions vary by customer and are based on the billing schedule established in the Company’s contracts with customers, but the contract generally requires advanced payments for a portion of transaction

price prior to delivery and payments of the remaining transaction price after the tools are accepted by customers; therefore, the Company has determined that its contracts do not include a significant financing component. For sales of spare parts, the contract generally requires payment within 30 days after delivery. Contract liabilities include advances from customers and deferred revenue.  Payments received from customers prior to the transfer of control of the tools are recorded as advances from customers.  Payments received from customers related to the allocated transaction price for the unsatisfied performance obligations  are recorded as deferred revenue.

Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue primarily consists of: direct materials, comprised principally of parts used in assembling equipment, together with crating and shipping costs; direct labor, including salaries and other labor related expenses attributable to the Company’s manufacturing department; allocated overhead cost and inventory provision.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs relating to the development of new products and processes, significant improvements and refinements to existing products or the process of supporting customer evaluations of tools, and the development of new tools 
for evaluation by customers during the product demonstration process, are expensed as incurred.
Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs attributable directly to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets that require a substantial period of time to be ready for their intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of those assets. Income earned on temporary investments of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on those assets is deducted from borrowing costs capitalized. All other borrowing costs are recognized in interest expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) in the period in which they are incurred.
Warranty
The Company
 generally provides a standard assurance type warranty ranging from 
12
 to 
36
 months and covering replacement of its product during the warranty period. 
The Company accounts for the estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. 
Warranty obligations are affected by historical failure rates and associated replacement costs. Utilizing historical warranty cost records, the Company calculates a rate of warranty expenses to revenue to determine the estimated warranty charge. The Company updates these estimated charges on a regular basis. Warranty obligations are included in other payables and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets.

The following table shows changes in the Company’s warranty obligations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Employee Benefit Expenses
The Company has a defined contribution 401(k) plan for eligible employees. Eligible employees have the option to participate in the plan beginning on their date of hire. Under the terms of the plan, employees may make voluntary contributions as a percentage of their compensation or a flat dollar amount.
All eligible employees of the Company’s mainland China subsidiaries are entitled to staff welf
are benefits including medical care, welfare grants, unemployment insurance and pension benefits through a mainland China government-mandated multi-employer defined contribution plan. The Company’s mainland China subsidiaries are required to accrue for these benefits based on certain percentages of the qualified employees’ salaries, and are required to make contributions to the plans out of the amounts accrued. The mainland China government is responsible for the medical benefits and the pension liability to be paid to these employees and the Company’s obligations are limited to the amounts contributed.

Government Subsidies
ACM Shanghai has received several special government grants. The government subsidies of operating nature with no further conditions to be met are recorded as other income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) when received.  The government grants that contain certain operating conditions, and require a government due diligence process to confirm completion, are deferred and recorded as other long-term liabilities (note 12) when received, and are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as follows:
•
Government subsidies relating to current expenses are recorded as reductions of those expenses in the periods in which the current expenses are recorded. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, related government subsidies recognized as reductions of relevant expenses in the consolidated statements of  comprehensive income (loss) were $

Stock-based Compensation
ACM and ACM Shanghai grants stock options to employees and non-employee consultants and directors and accounts for those stock-based awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, 
Compensation – Stock Compensation.
Stock-based awards granted to employees and non-employee consultants and directors are measured at the fair value of the awards on the grant date and are recognized as expenses either (a) immediately on grant, if no vesting conditions are required or (b) using the graded vesting method, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model when there are service and performance condition attached or the Monte Carlo valuation model when there is market condition attached. Stock-based compensation is charged to the category of operating expense corresponding to the service function of the employees and non-employee consultants and directors. The Company has elected to recognize share-based compensation on a straight-line basis for awards with graded vesting that vest based solely on a service condition. The Company uses the accelerated method for all awards granted based on service conditions and performance conditions, and only if performance conditions are considered probable to be satisfied.

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable values.
In evaluating the ability to recover its deferred income tax assets, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including its operating results, ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In the event the Company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would reduce the provision for income taxes. Conversely, in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made.
Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained during an audit. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included within the provision for income tax.

Basic and diluted net income per share of common stock is presented using the two-class method, which allocates undistributed earnings to common stock and any participating securities according to dividend rights and participation rights on a proportionate basis. Under the two-class method, basic net income per share of common stock is computed by dividing the sum of distributed and undistributed earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. ACM did not have any participating securities outstanding during the three-year periods ended December 31, 2024.
Class A and Class B common stock are substantially identical in all material respects, except for voting rights. Since ACM did not declare any dividends during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the net income per share of common stock attributable to each class is the same under the “two-class” method. As such, the two classes of common stock have been presented on a combined basis in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and in the above computation of net income per share of common stock.
Diluted net income per share of common stock reflects the potential dilution from securities, including stock options, that could share in ACM’s earnings. Certain potential dilutive securities were excluded from the net income per share calculation because the impact would be anti-dilutive.
 The number of potentially dilutive shares that were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share in the periods presented where their inclusion would be anti-dilutive were

,  
3,651,337
 and 
1,795,340
 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Comprehensive Income (loss)
The Company applies FASB ASC Topic 220, 
Comprehensive Income
, which establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income (loss), requiring its components to be reported in a financial statement with the same prominence as other financial statements. The Company’s comprehensive income (loss) includes net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, and unrealized gain on investments in available-for-sale debt securities and is presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

Restricted Net Assets 
The Company’s ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the Company receiving distributions of funds from its subsidiaries. Relevant statutory laws and regulations of mainland China permit payments of dividends by the Company’s mainland China subsidiaries only out of its retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with accounting standards and regulations of mainland China. The results of operations reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
97
Table of Contents
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP differ from those reflected in the statutory financial statements of the Company’s mainland China subsidiaries. The Company has not previously declared or paid any cash dividend or dividend in kind and has no plan to declare or pay any dividends in the near future.
Under laws and regulations of mainland China, there are restrictions on the Company’s mainland China subsidiaries with respect to transferring certain of their net assets to the Company either in the form of dividends, loans, or advances. Amounts of net assets restricted include paid-in capital and statutory surplus reserve of the Company’s mainland China subsidiaries totaling $
686,874
 as of December 31 2024. Therefore, in accordance with Rules 504 and 4.08(e)(3) of Regulation S-X, the condensed parent company only financial statements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 are disclosed in Note 21. 
Furthermore, cash transfers from the Company’s mainland China subsidiaries to its subsidiaries outside of China are subject to mainland China government control of currency conversion. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of the mainland China subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to the Company, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations.

Statutory Surplus Reserve
The income of ACM’s mainland China subsidiaries is distributable to their shareholders after transfers to reserves as required under relevant mainland China laws and regulations and the subsidiaries’ Articles of Association. As stipulated by the relevant laws and regulations in mainland China, mainland China subsidiaries are required to maintain reserves, including reserves for statutory surpluses and public welfare funds that are not distributable to shareholders. A mainland China subsidiary’s appropriations to the reserves are approved by its board of directors. At least 10% of annual statutory after-tax profits, as determined in accordance with mainland China accounting standards and regulations, is required to be allocated to the statutory surplus reserves. If the cumulative total of the statutory surplus reserves reaches 50% of a mainland China subsidiary’s registered capital, any further appropriation is optional.
Statutory surplus reserves may be used to offset accumulated losses or to increase the registered capital of a mainland China subsidiary, subject to approval from the relevant mainland China authorities, and are not available for dividend distribution to the subsidiary’s shareholders. The mainland China subsidiaries are prohibited from distributing dividends unless any losses from prior years have been offset. Except for offsetting prior years’ losses, however, statutory surplus reserves must be maintained at a minimum of 25% of share capital after such usage.
 ACM Shanghai estimated a statutory surplus reserve of $
30,514
 and $
30,060
 based on an accumulated profit as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, re
spectively, which is included in the statutory 
surplus reserve in the consolidated balance sheets.
Noncontrolling Interests 
A noncontrolling interest is recognized to reflect the portion of subsidiaries’ equity which is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to ACM Research. Consolidated net income on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) includes the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The cumulative results of operations attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded as “noncontrolling interests” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Financial Instruments
The Company periodically invests in equity and debt securities, and maintains an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. For equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, the Company classified them as long-term investments, and records them using either: 1) the measurement alternative which measures the equity investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes; or 2) the equity method whereby the Company recognizes its proportional share of the income or loss from the equity method investment. The equity method is utilized when the equity investments are common stock or in substance common stock, and the Company does not have the ability to control the investee but is deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee’s operating or financial policies. For equity investments that have a readily determinable fair value, the Company classified them as short-term investments, and records them at fair market value on a recurring basis based upon quoted market prices. Realized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from application of the measurement alternative, the impact of the application of the equity method to the Company’s equity investments, and recognition of 
98
Table of Contents
changes in fair market value, as applicable, are recognized as non-operating income (expenses), net in the 
consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 
The Company’s investments in debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its debt securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the 
consolidated balance sheets.
Fair Value Measurement
The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact, and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
A fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The level of an asset or liability in the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions.
Level 2: Valuations based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical assets or liabilities, or model-derived valuations techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3: Valuations based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities and based on non-binding, broker-provided price quotes and may not have been corroborated by observable market data.
The Company’s primary financial instruments include its cash, cash equivalents, short term and long term deposits, restricted cash, short-term and long-term investments, accounts receivable, other receivables, accounts payable, related party accounts payable , other payable, and short-term and long-term borrowings. The estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term time deposits, accounts receivable, other receivable, accounts payable, other payable, and short-term borrowings approximates their carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities. 
All transfers between fair value hierarchy levels are recognized by the Company at the end of each reporting period. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety, requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. The inputs or methodology used for valuing financial instruments are not necessarily an indication of the risks associated with investment in those instruments.

December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. 
The non-recurring fair value measurements to the carrying amount of equity investments accounted for using measurement alternative usually requires management to estimate a price adjustment for the different rights and obligations between a similar instrument of the same issuer with an observable price change in an orderly transaction and the investment held by the Company. These non-recurring fair value measurements were measured by using the observable transaction price and other unobservable inputs (level 3) as of the observable transaction dates.

Operating and Financial Risks
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, and accounts receivable. The Company deposits and invests its cash with financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy.
The Company is potentially subject to concentrations of credit risks in its accounts receivable and revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, four customers accounted for 
52.2
%, three customers accounted for 
45.5
% of revenue, and three customers accounted for 
43.8
% of revenue, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, four customers accounted for 
57.1
% and four customers accounted for 
59.1
%, respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivables. The Company believes that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on past collection experience.
Interest Rate Risk
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the balance of the Company’s short term bank borrowings (note 8) were scheduled to mature at various dates within the following year and thus exposed the Company to modest interest rate risk. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its long-term borrowings (note 12), and as certain long-term borrowings carry a fixed interest rate, the Company may be exposed to the fair value interest rate risk.
Liquidity Risk
The Company’s working capital at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was sufficient to meet its then-current requirements. The Company may, however, require additional cash due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions the Company decides to pursue. In the long run, the Company intends to rely primarily on cash flows from operations and additional borrowings from financial institutions in order to meet its cash needs. If those sources are insufficient to meet cash requirements, the Company may seek to issue additional debt or equity.
Country Risk
The Company has significant investments in mainland China. The operating results of the Company may be adversely affected either directly or indirectly by changes in the political and social conditions in mainland China,  by changes in mainland China government policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, rates and methods of taxation, and export controls enacted by the U.S., Japan, and the Netherlands to restrict the sale of certain technology to mainland China, among other things. 
Foreign Currency Risk and Translation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is the Company’s reporting currency, while the functional currency of ACM’s subsidiaries in mainland China and Korea are the Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”), and the Korean Won, respectively. Changes in the relative values of U.S. dollars and RMB affect the Company’s reported levels of revenues and profitability as the results of its operations are translated from RMB into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Since the Company has not engaged in any hedging activities, it cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of its operations, and it may experience economic losses as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Transactions of ACM’s subsidiaries involving foreign currencies are recorded in functional currency according to the rate of exchange prevailing on the date when the transaction occurs. The ending balances of the Company’s foreign currency accounts are converted into functional currency using the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange fluctuations as marked to market at year-end are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 830, 
Foreign Currency Matters
, the Company translates assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars from RMB or Korean Won using the rate of exchange prevailing at the applicable balance sheet date and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated statements of cash flows are translated at an 
101
Table of Contents
average rate during the reporting period. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded in stockholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, 
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of 2024, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
 (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Retrospective application is permitted. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU.
In December 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03: 
Income Statement--Reporting Comprehensive Income--Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)
, which requires additional disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures about selling expenses. In January 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-01, which clarifies the effective date of ASU 2024-03. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. This ASU should be applied prospectively with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU.

The Company assesses collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a general basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when the Company identifies specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, the Company considers historical collectability based on past due status, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company’s customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect the Company’s ability to collect from customers.

At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the value of finished goods inventory, which is comprised of first-tools at customer physical locations, for which customers were contractually obligated to take ownership upon acceptance, totaled $
206,018
 and $
123,390
, respectively.
The $
11,646
 decrease in raw materials and work-in-process inventory at December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was due in part to an increased focus on cash efficiency despite a higher level of expected total shipments for the next 12-months. The $
64,236
 increase in finished goods inventory at December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 reflects a higher value of first-tools under evaluation by existing or prospective customers, partly offset by a lower value of  completed tools at the Company's facilities.
The Company’s products each require a certain degree of customization, and the substantial majority of the work-in-process inventory and finished goods inventory is built to meet a specific customer order for repeat shipment or first tool delivery. At the end of each period, the Company assesses the status of each item in work-in-process and finished goods  inventory. The Company recognizes a loss or impairment if in management’s judgement the inventory cannot be sold or used for production, if it has been damaged or should be considered as obsolete, or if the net realizable value is lower than the cost. 
At the end of each period, the Company also assesses the status of its raw materials. The Company recognizes a loss or impairment for any raw materials aged more than 
three years
. The 
three-year
 aging is based on the Company’s assessment of technology change, its requirement to maintain stock and other factors. For raw materials aged less than 
three years
 of age, the Company recognizes a specific loss or impairment if the Company determines the item does not have future use or is otherwise impaired.  
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, provision for i
n
ventory of $
3,100

The Company’s effective tax rate differs from statutory rates of 21% for U.S. federal income tax purposes and 
12.5
% to 
25
% for mainland China income tax purpose due to the effects of the valuation allowance and certain permanent differences as they pertain to book-tax differences in employee stock-based compensation and non-US research expense. A new requirement to capitalize and amortize previously deductible research and experimental expenses resulting from a change in Section 174 made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”) became effective on January 1, 2022. Under the TCJA, the Company is required to capitalize, and subsequently amortize R&D expenses over 
fifteen years
 for research activities conducted outside of the U.S. The capitalization of overseas R&D expenses resulted in a significant increase in the Company’s global intangible low-taxed income inclusion beginning in 2022. 
Pursuant to the Corporate Income Tax Law of mainland China, all of the Company’s mainland China subsidiaries are liable to mainland China Corporate Income Taxes at a rate of 
25
%, except for ACM Shanghai and ACM Lingang. According to Guoshuihan 2009 No. 203, an entity certified as an “advanced and new technology enterprise” is entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 
15
%. ACM Shanghai was certified as an “advanced and new technology enterprise” in 2012 and again in 2016, 2018, 2021 and 2024,  effective until December 31, 2026.. In 2021, ACM Shanghai was certified as an eligible integrated circuit production enterprise and was entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 
12.5
% from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022. Certain entities which meet requirements according to the Policy of the Lingang New area in China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone are entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 
15
%. ACM Lingang was certified for this in 2021, and this preferential income tax rate is valid from January 1, 2020 until December 31, 2024. The provision for mainland China corporate income tax for ACM Shanghai is calculated by applying the income tax rate of 
15
% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and 
12.5
% for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The Company considers all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become realizable. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carry-forward periods), and projected taxable income in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Based on all available evidence, a partial valuation allowance has been established against some net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, based on estimates of recoverability. In order to fully realize the deferred tax assets, the Company must generate sufficient taxable income in future periods before the expiration of the deferred tax assets governed by the tax code.

2,030
 for U.S. federal income tax purposes and $

 for U.S. state income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had  NOLs, of $
3,121
 for U.S. federal income tax purposes and $

 for U.S. state income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had NOLs of $

30,481
 and $
46,467
 for mainland China income tax purposes and $
2,339

64
 for Korea income tax purposes. Such losses begin expiring in 2037, 2032, 2027 and 2037 for U.S. federal, U.S. state, mainland China, and Korea income tax purposes, respectively.
Under provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”), a limitation applies to the use of the U.S. net operating loss and credit carry-forwards that would be applicable if ACM experiences an “ownership change,” as defined in IRC Section 382. ACM conducted an analysis of its stock ownership under IRC Section 382 and $
2,030
 of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitation as a result of the ownership change in 2017. The net operating loss carryforwards are not expected to expire before utilization.
Tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

Certain tax years are subject to foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities until the statute of limitations expire.
The Company had $

 and $
1,667

Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"), the Company asserted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings, and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not made a provision for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately $
238,605
 of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries that is indefinitely reinvested. Generally, such amounts become subject to U.S. taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and 
124
Table of Contents
procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been tested by Ernst & Young Hua Ming LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
