In May 2020 ACM Shanghai, through its wholly owned subsidiary ACM Lingang, entered into an agreement for a 50-year land use right in the Lingang region of Shanghai. In July 2020 ACM Lingang began a multi-year construction project for a new development and production center. Construction of t
he five-building 
complex which comprises more than 1,485,000 square foot of floor space in aggregate is nearly completed, and is intended to incorporate state-of-the-art manufacturing systems and automation technologies and provide the floor space to significantly increase production capacity and support additional  research and development activities when fully-staffed and supplied. 
In connection with the Lingang facility project, on October 28, 2020, a wholly owned subsidiary of ACM Lingang entered into Shanghai Public Rental Housing Overall Pre-Sale Contracts with Shanghai Lingang Industrial Zone Public Rental Housing Construction and Operation Management Co., Ltd. for an aggregate price to us of approximately $40 million. ACM Lingang’s subsidiary received ownership of the apartment units and corresponding land use rights in January 2022 as part of a pilot project of public rental housing in the “rent before sale” park in the Lingang Industrial Zone. The contracts stipulate that, for a ten-year term, ACM Lingang’s subsidiary is obligated to manage the apartment units for public rental use in accordance with public rental housing standards and must rent the apartment units to employees of ACM Shanghai and its subsidiaries who work in the Lingang Industrial Zone. After that ten-year period expires, ACM Lingang’s subsidiary may use the apartment units as stock of commercial housing and may sell them separately in sets.
