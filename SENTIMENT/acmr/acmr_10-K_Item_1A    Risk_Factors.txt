Risks Related to International Aspects of Our Business
If any mainland China central government authority were to determine that existing mainland China laws or regulations require that ACM Shanghai obtain the authority’s permission or approval to continue the listing of ACM Research’s Class A common stock in the United States or if those existing mainland China laws and regulations, or 
19
Table of Contents
interpretations thereof, were to change to require such permission or approval, or if we inadvertently conclude that permissions or approvals are not required, ACM Shanghai may be unable to obtain the required permission or approval or may only be able to obtain such permission or approval on terms and conditions that impose material new restrictions and limitations on operation of ACM Shanghai, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects and on the trading price of ACM Research Class A common stock, which could decline in value or become worthless.
Mainland China central government authorities have taken steps to preclude, or significantly discourage, certain mainland China companies from listing on U.S. and other exchanges outside mainland China. Investments activities in mainland China by non-mainland China investors are principally governed by the Encouraged Industries Catalog for Foreign Investment (2020 version) and the Special Administrative Measures for Foreign Investment Access (Negative List 2021), both of which were promulgated by mainland China’s Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, and National Development and Reform Commission. These regulations set forth the industries in which foreign investments are encouraged, restricted and prohibited.
Industries that are not listed in any of these three categories are generally open to foreign investment unless otherwise specifically restricted by other mainland China rules and regulations. We believe that our operations do not fall within any industry that is restricted or prohibited under these regulations and that the regulations therefore do not apply to us.
Mainland China-based companies that seek to list their shares in the United States but are subject to mainland China restrictions on investments by non-mainland China investors sometimes use a special purpose vehicle known as a VIE created in an off-shore jurisdiction such as the Cayman Islands. In these structures, a VIE enters into a series of contractual arrangements with mainland China-based operating company and its mainland China-based shareholders that afford those shareholders, rather than the shareholders of the VIE, effective control over the finances and operations of the operating company. The VIE, effectively a shell company, issues share that are listed for trading on a U.S. exchange, but the enterprise is controlled by the legacy mainland China-based shareholders and is subject to mainland China laws and regulations. ACM Research is not a VIE or other special purpose, or shell, company, and its relationship with ACM Shanghai does not involve the types of contractual arrangements existing between a VIE and a mainland China-based operating company. ACM Research is a Delaware corporation founded in California in 1998 that formed ACM Shanghai to conduct business operations in mainland China. ACM Research controls the operations of ACM Shanghai through its direct ownership of ACM Shanghai shares, and it also conducts sales and marketing activities focused on sales of ACM Shanghai products in North America, Europe and certain regions in Asia outside mainland China.
We do not believe that our corporate structure or any other matters relating to our business operations currently require that ACM Shanghai obtain any permissions or approvals from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, or any other mainland China central government authority in connection with ACM’s listing, or offering for sale in the future, shares of our Class A common stock in the United States. We, including ACM Shanghai, therefore have never solicited any permission or approval from any mainland China central government authority, and thus no such permissions or approvals have been received or denied, in connection with ACM Research’s seeking and maintaining the listing of our Class A common stock in the United States. In the event that we inadvertently conclude that permissions or approvals are not required, or either the CSRC or another mainland China central government authority were to determine that existing mainland China laws or regulations require that ACM Shanghai obtain the authority’s permission or approval to continue ACM Research’s listing of Class A common stock in the United States or if those existing mainland China laws and regulations, or interpretations thereof, were to change to require such permission or approval, ACM Shanghai could be unable to obtain any such permission or approval or could be able to obtain such permission or approval only on terms and conditions that impose material new operating or other restrictions and limitations on ACM Shanghai. In such circumstances, it would materially and adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock, which may decline in value or become worthless. In addition, ACM Shanghai could face sanctions by the CSRC or other mainland China central government authorities or pressure from the mainland China government in various business matters for failure to obtain such permission or approval. Such potential sanctions or pressure may include fines and penalties on ACM Shanghai’s operations in mainland China, limitations on its operating privileges in mainland China, delays in or restrictions on the transfer of proceeds from a public offering of ACM Research securities in the United States to ACM Shanghai, restrictions on or prohibition of the payments or remittance of dividends by ACM Shanghai to ACM Research, or other actions that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of ACM Research Class A common stock, which could decline in value or become worthless.

Mainland China central government authorities may intervene in, or influence, ACM Shanghai’s mainland China-based operations at any time, and those authorities’ rules and regulations in mainland China can change quickly with little or no advance notice.
The business of ACM Shanghai is subject to complex laws and regulations in mainland China that can change quickly with little or no advance notice. We have not experienced such intervention or influence by mainland China central government authorities or a change in those authorities’ rules and regulations that have had a material impact of ACM Shanghai or ACM Research. We cannot assure you, however, that future changes in mainland China laws and regulations will not materially and adversely affect our mainland China-based operations. For example:
•
Intellectual Property
. Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and trade secret protection for our intellectual property, including our SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe, ECP, furnace and other technologies and the design of our Ultra C equipment. See “—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Data Security—
Our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property, including our SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe, ECP, furnace and other technologies
.” in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of Part I of this report. The significant majority of our intellectual property has been developed in mainland China and is owned by ACM Shanghai. Implementation and enforcement of intellectual property-related laws in mainland China have historically been lacking due primarily to ambiguities in mainland China intellectual property law. See “—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Data Security—
We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, including mainland China, which could materially, negatively affect our business
” in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of Part I of this report. In the event mainland China central government authorities were to significantly revise or revamp the current scope and structure of intellectual property protection in mainland China, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights for our key proprietary technologies may be adversely impacted and competitors may be able to match our technologies and tools in order to compete with us.
•
Data Security
. The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, or the Standing Committee, has promulgated the Cyber Security Law, which imposes requirements on entities who build and operate mainland China’s internet architecture or provide services in mainland China over the internet, and the Data Security Law, which imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out data activities. The Data Security Law also provides for a national security review procedure for data activities that may affect national security and imposes export restrictions on certain data an information. ACM Shanghai is not subject to the existing restrictions imposed by the Cyber Security Law or the Data Security Law, in part because its business operations do not involve the collection, processing or use of data or information involving personal privacy or private information of customers. In addition, ACM Shanghai is subject to oversight by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or the CAC, regarding data security. ACM Shanghai does not collect or maintain personal information except for routine personal information necessary to process payroll payments and other benefits and emergency contact information, and as a result, ACM Shanghai is not currently subject to significant restrictions or limitations in addressing and managing data security issues and complying with CAC regulations. To date, ACM Shanghai has not been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by the CAC or any related mainland China central government authority and has not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanction in such respect. However, cybersecurity is increasingly a focus of the mainland China central government. If the CAC or other mainland China central government authorities should in the future require ACM Shanghai to comply with these or additional, or more restrictive, mainland China cybersecurity regulations, it could require ACM Shanghai to make changes to its operations, and any failure to satisfy or delay in meeting such requirements may subject ACM Shanghai to restrictions and penalties imposed by the CAC or other mainland China regulatory authorities, which may include regulatory actions, fines and penalties on our operations in mainland China, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.
•
Anti-Monopoly
. A number of mainland China laws and regulations have established procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities in China by foreign investors more time consuming and complex. These laws and regulations, which include the Anti-Monopoly Law and the Rules of the Ministry of Commerce on Implementation of Security Review System of Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, impose requirements that in some instances that MOFCOM be notified in advance of, for example, any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a mainland China domestic enterprise. In addition, such Rules specify that mergers and acquisitions 
21
Table of Contents
by foreign investors that raise “national defense and security” concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise “national security” concerns are subject to strict review by MOFCOM. In February 2021, the Anti-Monopoly Committee of the State Council published the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for the Internet Platform Economy Sector, which stipulate that any concentration of undertakings involving VIEs is subject to anti-monopoly review. Those Guidelines provide more stringent rules for Internet platform operators, including regulations on the use of data and algorithms, technology and platform to commit abusive acts. The Measures for the Security Review for Foreign Investment, which was promulgated jointly by National Development and Reform Commission and MOFCOM effective January 18, 2021, and the Standing Committee on Amending the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China, which was promulgated by the Standing Committee effective August 1, 2022, delineated provisions concerning the security review procedures on foreign investment, including the types of investments subject to review and the scopes and procedures of the review. ACM Shanghai does not have the concentration of business operators stipulated in the Anti-Monopoly Law, and our operations and activities to date have not otherwise subjected us to restrictive provisions or limitations set forth in applicable mainland China laws and regulations govern merger and acquisition activities. Among other things, ACM Shanghai’s business operations do not constitute identified “national defense and security” concerns associated with the arms industry, any industry ancillary to the arms industry, or any other field related to national defense security. We cannot assure you, however, that future changes in mainland China laws and regulations governing mergers and acquisitions, including activities in mainland China by foreign investors, will not extend or otherwise modify existing requirements, which could materially and adversely affect our mainland China-based operations or our ability to expand by investments or acquisitions.
•
Permits
. In the ordinary course of business, ACM Shanghai has obtained all of the permits and licenses it believes are necessary for it to operate in mainland China. ACM Shanghai may be adversely affected, however, by the complexity, uncertainties and changes in mainland China laws and regulations applicable to, or otherwise affecting, the semiconductor equipment industry and related businesses, and any lack of requisite approvals, licenses or permits applicable to ACM Shanghai’s business may have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.
•
Trade Policies
. Since 2018, general trade tensions between the United States and mainland China have escalated. See “—Regulatory Risks—
Changes in government trade policies could limit the demand for our tools and increase the cost of our tools”
 in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of Part I of this report. The imposition of tariffs by the U.S. and mainland China governments and the surrounding economic uncertainty may negatively impact the semiconductor industry, including by reducing the demand of fabricators for capital equipment such as our tools. Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, additional taxes, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit the ability of our customers to manufacture or sell semiconductors or to make the manufacture or sale of semiconductors more expensive and less profitable, which could lead those customers to fabricate fewer semiconductors and to invest less in capital equipment such as our tools. In addition, if mainland China were to impose additional tariffs on raw materials, subsystems or other supplies that we source from the United States, our cost for those supplies would increase. As a result of any of the foregoing events, the imposition of new or additional tariffs may limit our ability to manufacture tools, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, or inhibit our ability to sell tools or to purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
Moreover, by imposing industrial policies and other economic measures, such as control of foreign exchange, taxation and foreign investment, the mainland China central government exerts considerable direct and indirect influence on the development of the mainland China economy. Other political, economic and social factors may also lead to further legal and regulatory changes and reforms, which may adversely affect our operations and business development.
The mainland China central government may determine to exert additional control over offerings conducted overseas or foreign investment in mainland China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in operations of ACM Shanghai and cause significant declines in the value of ACM Research Class A common stock, or make them worthless.
The mainland China central government may determine to exert additional control over securities offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in mainland China-based issuers, which could result in a material adverse change in operations of ACM Shanghai and cause the value of ACM Research Class A common stock to significantly decline or

become worthless. See also “—
If any mainland China central government authority were to determine that existing mainland China laws or regulations require that ACM Shanghai obtain the authority’s permission or approval to continue the listing of ACM Research’s Class A common stock in the United States or if those existing mainland China laws and regulations, or interpretations thereof, were to change to require such permission or approval, ACM Shanghai may be unable to obtain the required permission or approval or may only be able to obtain such permission or approval on terms and conditions that impose material new restrictions and limitations on operation of ACM Shanghai, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects and on the trading price of ACM Research Class A common stock, which could decline in value or become worthless
” above.
We could be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with legislation and regulations regarding improved access to audit and other information and audit inspections of accounting firms, including registered public accounting firms, such as our prior and current audit firms, operating in mainland China.
The HFCA Act, which became law in December 2020, includes requirements for the SEC to identify issuers whose audit work is performed by auditors that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a restriction imposed by a non-U.S. authority in any non-U.S. jurisdiction. Under current regulations, the HFCA Act also requires that, to the extent that the PCAOB has been unable to inspect an issuer’s auditor for two consecutive years, the SEC shall prohibit the issuer’s securities registered in the United States from being traded on any national securities exchange or over-the-counter market in the United States. On March 30, 2022, we were transferred to the SEC’s “Conclusive list of issuers identified under the HFCA Act” (the “Conclusive List”) because the PCAOB determined that it was unable to inspect or investigate completely BDO China Shu Lun Pan Certified Public Accountants (“BDO China”), our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.

The determinations announced by the PCAOB were vacated by the PCAOB on December 15, 2022, and BDO China is no longer our independent registered public accounting firm.

Our current independent registered public accounting firm, E&Y, is a PCAOB-registered firm that is headquartered in mainland China; however, we do not believe ACM Research will appear on the Conclusive List for a second consecutive time due to the determinations of the PCAOB being vacated.

However, if we were to appear for two consecutive years on the Conclusive List, the value of our securities may significantly decline or become worthless, and our securities would be prohibited from trading and may eventually be delisted. It also remains unclear what further actions the SEC, the PCAOB or Nasdaq may take to address these issues and what impact those actions will have on U.S. companies, such as ours, that have significant operations in mainland China and have securities listed on a U.S. stock exchange. Any such actions could materially affect our operations and stock price, including by resulting in our being de-listed from Nasdaq or being required to engage a new audit firm, which would require significant expense and management time.
It may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigations or collect evidence within mainland China.
Stockholder claims or regulatory investigations that are common in the United States generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in mainland China. For example, in mainland China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to providing information needed for regulatory investigations or litigation initiated outside of mainland China. Although the authorities in mainland China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, such cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the absence of mutual and practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the mainland China Securities Law, or Article 177, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the territory of mainland China. While detailed interpretation of or implementing rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability for an overseas securities regulator to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within mainland China may further increase difficulties faced by you in protecting your interests.
Because substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States and certain of our officers reside outside of the United States, it may be difficult for you to enforce your rights based on the U.S. federal securities laws against such assets or officers or to enforce a judgment of a United States court against assets or officers  in mainland China.
While ACM Research is a Delaware corporation, certain of our officers are nonresidents of the United States, and certain of our assets are located in mainland China, and the operations of ACM Shanghai are conducted in mainland China. It may, therefore, not be possible to effect service of process on such persons in the United States, and it may be difficult to enforce any judgments rendered against them or any of our assets that are located overseas. Moreover, there is doubt whether courts in mainland China would enforce (a) judgments of United States courts against ACM Shanghai, our officers based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state, or (b) in original actions brought in mainland China, liabilities against us or any nonresidents based upon the securities laws of the United States or any state.
23
Table of Contents
We conduct substantially all of our operations outside the United States and face risks associated with conducting business in foreign markets.
Substantially all of our sales in 2024, 2023, and 2022 were made to customers outside the United States. Our manufacturing center has been located in Shanghai since 2006 and substantially all of our operations are located in mainland China. We expect that all of our significant activities will remain outside the United States in the future. We are subject to a number of risks associated with our international business activities, including:
•
the need to comply with the import laws and regulations of various foreign jurisdictions, including a range of U.S. import laws;
•
potentially adverse tax consequences, including withholding tax rules that may limit the repatriation of our earnings, and higher effective income tax rates in foreign countries where we conduct business;
•
competition from local suppliers with which potential customers may prefer to do business;
•
seasonal reduction in business activity, such as during the Lunar New Year in parts of Asia and in other periods in various individual countries;
•
increased exposure to foreign currency exchange rates;
•
reduced protection for intellectual property;
•
longer sales cycles and reliance on indirect sales in certain regions;
•
increased length of time for shipping and acceptance of our products;
•
greater difficulty in responding to customer requests for maintenance and spare parts on a timely basis;
•
greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;
•
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;
•
heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, our consolidated financial statements; and
•
general economic conditions, geopolitical events or natural disasters in countries where we conduct our operations or where our customers are located, including political unrest, war, acts of terrorism or responses to such events.
In particular, the Asian market is extremely competitive, and chip manufacturers may be aggressive in seeking price concessions from suppliers, including chip equipment manufacturers.
We may not be successful in developing and implementing policies and strategies that will be effective in managing these risks in each country in which we do business. Our failure to manage these risks successfully could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
Our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a sizable portion of our costs are denominated in other currencies, principally the Chinese Renminbi and, to a lesser extent, the Korean Won. Because many of our raw material purchases are denominated in Renminbi while the majority of the purchase orders we receive are denominated in U.S. dollars, exchange rates have a significant effect on our gross margin. We have not engaged in any foreign currency exchange hedging transactions to date, and any strategies that we may use in the future to reduce the adverse impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may not be successful. Our foreign currency exposure with respect to assets and liabilities for which we do not have hedging arrangements could have a material impact on our results of operations in periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to unhedged non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business.
The exacerbation or further continuation of currently challenging global systemic economic and financial conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Any prolonged slowdown in mainland China, United States or global economy may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Financial and other markets in the United States and worldwide have experienced significant volatility reflecting uncertainty over, among other things, (a) the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies, including the United States and mainland China, (b) unrest in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa, and (c) the rising level of inflation in major industrial countries, including the United States, and worries that efforts to curb 
24
Table of Contents
inflation may result in an economic recession. General inflation, including rising energy prices, interest rates and wages, could adversely impact our business by increasing our operating and borrowing costs as well as limiting the amount of capital available for customers to purchase our products. This economic turmoil has had, and could continue to have, a number of repercussions on our business, including significant decreases in orders from our customers, business slowdowns or cessations at key suppliers resulting in delays in our product deliveries, increased raw material prices leading to increased production costs that we may not be able to pass onto customers, and business challenges at customers resulting in the inability to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products or even insolvency, and counterparty failures negatively impacting our operations and sales. Any systemic economic or financial crisis could cause revenues for the semiconductor industry as a whole to decline dramatically, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry
We may require additional capital in the future and we cannot give any assurance that such capital will be available at all or available on terms acceptable to us and, if it is available, additional capital raised by us may dilute holders of Class A common stock.
We may need to raise funds in the future, depending on many factors, including:
•
our sales growth;
•
the costs of applying our existing technologies to new or enhanced products;
•
the costs of developing new technologies and introducing new products;
•
the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property;
•
the costs associated with our expansion, including capital expenditures and Lingang-related land purchases and deposits, and with increasing our sales and marketing and service and support efforts, and with expanding our geographic operations;
•
our ability to continue to obtain governmental subsidies for developmental projects in the future;
•
future debt repayment obligations; and
•
the number and timing of any future acquisitions.
To the extent that our existing sources of cash, together with any cash generated from operations, are insufficient to fund our activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funding is not available, we may be required to reduce expenditures, including curtailing our growth strategies and reducing our product development efforts, or to forego acquisition opportunities.
Proceeds received by ACM Shanghai from the initial placements of shares with mainland China investors, from the STAR IPO in connection with the STAR Listing of ACM Shanghai shares on the STAR Market, and from future financing activities undertaken by ACM Shanghai (including follow-on offerings or private placements of shares with mainland China investors), will generally be used to grow and support our mainland China operations. Those proceeds generally are not available for distribution to ACM Research. Under existing mainland China laws and regulations, it may be difficult, if not impossible, for ACM Research to be able to receive dividends comprised of funds generated by ACM Shanghai and, even if such dividends can be paid from mainland China to the United States, any such dividends can be paid to ACM Research only if other holders of ACM Shanghai shares receive their pro rata dividends.
 As a result, it is unlikely that funds raised or generated by ACM Shanghai will be readily distributable to ACM Research.
If we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securit
ies, then the issuance could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. Furthermore, the holders of these new securities or debt may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of Class A common stock. In addition, any preferred equity issuance or debt financing that we may obtain in the future could have restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.
Our quarterly operating results can be difficult to predict and can fluctuate substantially, which could result in volatility in the price of Class A common stock.
Our quarterly revenue and other operating results have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future 
25
Table of Contents
performance. Any variations in our quarter-to-quarter performance may cause our stock price to fluctuate. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by a variety of factors, including:
•
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and the related impact on the purchase of equipment used in the manufacture of chips;
•
the timing of purchases of our tools by chip fabricators, which order types of tools based on multi-year capital plans under which the number and dollar amount of tool purchases can vary significantly from year to year;
•
the relatively high average selling price of our tools and our dependence on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue in any period, whereby the timing and volume of purchase orders or cancellations from our customers could significantly reduce our revenue for that period;
•
the significant expenditures required to customize our products often exceed the deposits received from our customers;
•
the lead time required to manufacture our tools;
•
the timing of recognizing revenue due to the timing of shipment and acceptance of our tools;
•
our ability to sell additional tools to existing customers;
•
the changes in customer specifications or requirements;
•
the length of our product sales cycle;
•
changes in our product mix, including the mix of systems, upgrades, spare parts and service;
•
the timing of our product releases or upgrades or announcements of product releases or upgrades by us or our competitors, including changes in customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements;
•
our ability to enhance our tools with new and better functionality that meet customer requirements and changing industry trends;
•
constraints on our suppliers’ capacity;

the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, including defending our intellectual property against third-party claims or litigation.
Seasonality has played an increasingly important role in the market for chip manufacturing tools. The period of November through February has been a particularly weak period historically for manufacturers of chip tools, in part because capital equipment needed to support manufacturing of chips for the December holidays usually needs to be in the supply chain by no later than October and chip makers in Asia often wait until after Chinese, or Lunar, New Year, which occurs in January or February, before implementing their capital acquisition plans. The timing of new product releases also has an impact on seasonality, with the acquisition of manufacturing equipment occurring six to nine months before a new release.
Many of these factors are beyond our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them could cause our operating results to vary widely. As a result, it is difficult for us to forecast our quarterly revenue accurately. Our results of operations for any quarter may not be indicative of results for future quarters and quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful. Variability in our periodic operating results could lead to volatility in our stock price. Because a substantial proportion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our results of operations will suffer if revenue falls below our expectations in a particular quarter, which could cause the price of Class A common stock to decline. Moreover, as a result of any of the foregoing factors, our operating results might not meet our announced guidance or expectations of public market analysts or investors, in which case the price of Class A common stock could decrease significantly.
Cyclicality in the semiconductor industry is likely to lead to substantial variations in demand for our products, and as a result our operating results could be adversely affected.
The chip industry has historically been cyclic and is characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. From time to time, this industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, 
26
Table of Contents
maturing product and technology cycles, excess inventories and declines in general economic conditions. This cyclicality could cause our operating results to decline dramatically from one period to the next.
Our business depends upon the capital spending of chip manufacturers, which, in turn, depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for chips. During industry downturns, chip manufacturers often have excess manufacturing capacity and may experience reductions in profitability due to lower sales and increased pricing pressure for their products. As a result, chip manufacturers generally sharply curtail their spending during industry downturns and historically have lowered their spending more than the decline in their revenues. If we are unable to control our expenses adequately in response to lower revenue from our customers, our operating results will suffer and we could experience operating losses. 
We canno
t reasonably estimate the duration or impact of such a downturn, and it could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our Class A common stock.
Conversely, during industry upturns we must successfully increase production output to meet expected customer demand. This may require us or our suppliers, including third-party contractors, to order additional inventory, hire additional employees and expand manufacturing capacity. If we are unable to respond to a rapid increase in demand for our tools on a timely basis, or if we misjudge the timing, duration or magnitude of such an increase in demand, we may lose business to our competitors or incur increased costs disproportionate to any gains in revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
The mainland China government is implementing focused policies, including state-led investment initiatives, that aim to create and support an independent domestic semiconductor supply chain spanning from design to final system production. If these policies, which include loans and subsidies, result in lower demand for equipment than is expected by equipment manufacturers, the resulting overcapacity in the chip manufacturing equipment market could lead to excess inventory and price discounting that could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results. There are also a limited number of potential customers for our products.
The chip manufacturing industry is highly concentrated, and we derive most of our revenue from a limited number of customers. A total of four customers accounted for 52.2% of our revenue in 2024, three customers accounted for 45.5%% of our revenue in 2023, and three customers accounted for 43.8% of our revenue in 2022.
As a consequence of the concentrated nature of our customer base, our revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate, and any cancellation of orders or any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases or the acceptance of shipped products by our larger customers could materially affect our revenue and results of operations in any quarterly period.
We may be unable to sustain or increase our revenue from our larger customers or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by our larger customers with purchases by new or existing customers. We expect a small number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future and that our results of operations may fluctuate materially as a result of such larger customers’ buying patterns. Thus, our business success depends on our ability to maintain strong relationships with our customers. The loss of any of our key customers for any reason, or a change in our relationship with any of our key customers, including a significant delay or reduction in their purchases, may cause a significant decrease in our revenue, which we may not be able to recapture due to the limited number of potential customers.
We have seen, and may see in the future, consolidation of our customer base. Industry consolidation generally has negative implications for equipment suppliers, including a reduction in the number of potential customers, a decrease in aggregate capital spending and greater pricing leverage on the part of consumers over equipment suppliers. Continued consolidation of the chip industry could make it more difficult for us to grow our customer base, increase sales of our products and maintain adequate gross margins.
Our success will depend on industry chip manufacturers adopting our SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe, ECP, furnace and other technologies.
To date our strategy for commercializing our tools has been to place them with selected industry leaders in the manufacturing of memory and logic chips, the two largest chip categories, to enable those leading manufacturers to 
27
Table of Contents
evaluate our technologies, and then leverage our reputation to gain broader market acceptance. In order for these industry leaders to adopt our tools, we need to establish our credibility by demonstrating the differentiated, innovative nature of our SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe, ECP, furnace and other technologies. If these leading manufacturers do not agree that our technologies add significant value over conventional technologies or do not otherwise accept and use our tools, we may need to spend a significant amount of time and resources to enhance our technologies or develop new technologies. Even if these leading manufacturers adopt our technologies, other manufacturers may not choose to accept and adopt our tools and our products may not achieve widespread adoption. Any of the above factors would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
If our SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe, ECP, furnace and other technologies do not achieve widespread market acceptance, we will not be able to compete effectively.
The commercial success of our tools will depend, in part, on gaining substantial market acceptance by chip manufacturers. Our ability to gain acceptance for our products will depend upon a number of factors, including:
•
our ability to demonstrate the differentiated, innovative nature of our SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe, ECP, furnace and other technologies and the advantages of our tools over those of our competitors;
•
compatibility of our tools with existing or potential customers’ manufacturing processes and products;
•
the level of customer service available to support our products; and
•
the experiences our customers have with our products.
In addition, obtaining orders from new customers may be difficult because many chip manufacturers have pre-existing relationships with our competitors. Chip manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wet processing equipment into a chip production line. Due, in part, to the cost of manufacturing equipment and the investment necessary to integrate a particular manufacturing process, a chip manufacturer that has selected a particular supplier’s equipment and qualified that equipment for production typically continues to use that equipment for the specific production application and process node, which is the minimum line width on a chip, as long as that equipment continues to meet performance specifications. Some of our potential and existing customers may prefer larger, more established vendors from which they can purchase equipment for a wider variety of process steps than our tools address. Further, because the cleaning process with our TEBO equipment can be up to five times longer than cleaning processes based on other technologies, we must convince chip manufacturers of the innovative, differentiated nature of our technologies and the benefits associated with using our tools. If we are unable to obtain new customers and continue to achieve widespread market acceptance of our tools, then our business, operations, financial results and growth prospects will be materially and adversely affected.
If we do not continue to enhance our existing tools and achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to compete effectively.
We operate in an industry that is subject to evolving standards, rapid technological changes and changes in customer demands. Additionally, if process nodes continue to shrink to ever-smaller dimensions and conventional two-dimensional chips reach their critical performance limitations, the technology associated with manufacturing chips may advance to a point where our Ultra C equipment based on SAPS, TEBO, Tahoe, ECP, furnace and other technologies becomes obsolete. Accordingly, the future of our business will depend in large part upon the continuing relevance of our technological capabilities, our ability to interpret customer and market requirements in advance of tool deliveries, and our ability to introduce in a timely manner new tools that address chip makers’ requirements for cost-effective cleaning solutions. We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources developing new tools and enhancing existing tools. Our ability to introduce and market successfully any new or enhanced cleaning equipment is subject to a wide variety of challenges during the tool’s development, including the following:
•
accurate anticipation of market requirements, changes in technology and evolving standards;
•
the availability of qualified product designers and technologies needed to solve difficult design challenges in a cost-effective, reliable manner;
•
our ability to design products that meet chip manufacturers’ cost, size, acceptance and specification criteria, and performance requirements;
•
the ability and availability of suppliers and third-party manufacturers to manufacture and deliver the critical components and subassemblies of our tools in a timely manner;
•
market acceptance of our customers’ products, and the lifecycle of those products; and
•
our ability to deliver products in a timely manner within our customers’ product planning and deployment cycle.
28
Table of Contents
Certain enhancements to our products in future periods may reduce demand for our pre-existing tools. As we introduce new or enhanced cleaning tools, we must manage the transition from older tools in order to minimize disruptions in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older tool inventories and ensure timely delivery of sufficient supplies of new tools to meet customer demand. Furthermore, product introductions could delay purchases by customers awaiting arrival of our new products, which could cause us to fail to meet our expected level of production orders for pre-existing tools.
Our success will depend on our ability to identify and enter new product markets.
We expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources identifying new product markets in addition to the market for cleaning solutions and in developing new products for entry into these markets. Product development requires significant investments in engineering hours, third-party development costs, prototypes and sample materials, as well as sales and marketing expenses, which will not be recouped if the product launch is unsuccessful. We may fail to predict the needs of other markets accurately or develop new, innovative technologies to address those needs. Further, we may not be able to design and introduce new products in a timely or cost-efficient manner, and our new products may be more costly to develop, may fail to meet the requirements of the market, or may be adopted slower than we expect. If we are not able to introduce new products successfully, our inability to gain market share in new product markets could adversely affect our ability to sustain our revenue growth or maintain our current revenue levels.
If we fail to establish and maintain a reputation for credibility and product quality, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our operating results may suffer.
We must develop and maintain a market reputation for innovative, differentiated technologies and high quality, reliable products in order to attract new customers and achieve widespread market acceptance of our products. Our market reputation is critical because we compete against several larger, more established competitors, many of which supply equipment for a larger number of process steps than we do to a broader customer base in an industry with a limited number of customers. In these circumstances, traditional marketing and branding efforts are of limited value, and our success depends on our ability to provide customers with reliable and technically sophisticated products. If the limited customer base does not perceive our products and services to be of high quality and effectiveness, our reputation could be harmed, which could adversely impact our ability to achieve our targeted growth.
We operate in a highly competitive industry and many of our competitors are larger, better-established, and have significantly greater operating and financial resources than we have.
The chip equipment industry is highly competitive, and we face substantial competition throughout the world in each of the markets we serve. Many of our current and potential competitors have, among other things:
•
greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources;
•
established credibility and market reputations;
•
longer operating histories;
•
broader product offerings;
•
more extensive service offerings, including the ability to have large inventories of spare parts available near, or even at, customer locations;
•
local sales forces; and
•
more extensive geographic coverage.
These competitors may also have the ability to offer their products at lower prices by subsidizing their losses in wet cleaning with profits from other lines of business in order to retain current or obtain new customers. Among other things, some competitors have the ability to offer bundled discounts for customers purchasing multiple products. Many of our competitors have more extensive customer and partner relationships than we do and may therefore be in a better position to identify and respond to market developments and changes in customer demands. Potential customers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier, regardless of product performance or features. If we are not able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors, our business, operating results and financial condition will be negatively affected.
Our customers do not generally enter into long-term purchase commitments, and they may decrease, cancel or delay their projected purchases at any time.
In accordance with industry practice, our sales are on a purchase order basis, which we seek to obtain three to four months in advance of the expected product delivery date. Until a purchase order is received, we do not have a binding purchase 
29
Table of Contents
commitment. Our customers to date have provided us with non-binding one- to two-year forecasts of their anticipated demands, but those forecasts can be changed at any time, without any required notice to us. Because the lead-time needed to produce a tool customized to a customer’s specifications can extend up to six months, we may need to begin production of tools based on non-binding forecasts, rather than waiting to receive a binding purchase order. No assurance can be made that a customer’s forecast will result in a firm purchase order within the time period we expect, or at all.
If we do not accurately predict the amount and timing of a customer’s future purchases, we risk expending time and resources on producing a customized tool that is not purchased by a particular customer, which may result in excess or unwanted inventory, or we may be unable to fulfill an order on the schedule required by a purchase order, which would result in foregone sales. Customers may place purchase orders that exceed forecasted amounts, which could result in delays in our delivery time and harm our reputation. In the future a customer may decide not to purchase our tools at all, may purchase fewer tools than it did in the past or may otherwise alter its purchasing patterns, and the impact of any such actions may be intensified given our dependence on a small number of large customers. Our customers make major purchases periodically as they add capacity or otherwise implement technology upgrades. If any significant customers cancel, delay or reduce orders, our operating results could suffer.
We may incur significant expenses long before we can recognize revenue from new products, if at all, due to the costs and length of research, development, manufacturing and customer evaluation process cycles.
We often incur significant research and development costs for products that are purchased by our customers only after much, or all, of the cost has been incurred or that may never be purchased. We allow some new customers, or existing customers considering new products, to evaluate products without any payment becoming due unless the product is ultimately accepted, which means we may invest a significant amount in manufacturing a tool that may never be accepted and purchased or may be purchased months or even years after production. In the past we have borrowed money in order to fund first-time purchase order equipment and next-generation evaluation equipment. When we deliver evaluation equipment, or a “first tool,” we may not recognize revenue or receive payment for the tool for 24 months or longer. Even returning customers may take as long as six months to make any payments. If our sales efforts are unsuccessful after expending significant resources, or if we experience delays in completing sales, our future cash flow, revenue and profitability may fluctuate or be materially adversely affected.
Our sales cycle is long and unpredictable, which results in variability of our financial performance and may require us to incur high sales and marketing expenses with no assurance that a sale will result, all of which could adversely affect our profitability.
Our results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the resource-intensive nature of our sales efforts and the length and variability of our sales cycle. A sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective customer and any sale of our tools. Our sales process involves educating customers about our tools, participating in extended tool evaluations and configuring our tools to customer-specific needs, after which customers may evaluate the tools. The length of our sales cycle, from initial contact with a customer to the execution of a purchase order, is generally 6 to 24 months. During the sales cycle, we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities and make investments in evaluation equipment, all of which lower our operating margins, particularly if no sale occurs or if the sale is delayed as a result of extended qualification processes or delays from our customers’ customers.
The duration or ultimate success of our sales cycle depends on factors such as:
•
efforts by our sales force;
•
the complexity of our customers’ manufacturing processes and the compatibility of our tools with those processes;
•
our customers’ internal technical capabilities and sophistication; and
•
our customers’ capital spending plans and processes, including budgetary constraints, internal approvals, extended negotiations or administrative delays.
It is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale to a potential customer or if we can increase sales to our existing customers. As a result, we may not recognize revenue from our sales efforts for extended periods of time, or at all. The loss or delay of one or more large transactions in a quarter could impact our results of operations for that quarter and any future quarters for which revenue from that transaction is lost or delayed. In addition, we believe that the length of the sales cycle and intensity of the evaluation process may increase for those current and potential customers that centralize their purchasing decisions.

Difficulties in forecasting demand for our tools may lead to periodic inventory shortages or excess spending on inventory items that may not be used.
We need to manage our inventory of components and production of tools effectively to meet changing customer requirements. Accurately forecasting customers’ needs is difficult. Our tool demand forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, including non-binding forecasts received from our customers years in advance, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. Inventory levels for components necessary to build our tools in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs and could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we underestimate demand for our tools or if our manufacturing partners fail to supply components we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Such shortages might delay production or shipments to customers and may cause us to lose sales. These shortages may also harm our credibility, diminish the loyalty of our channel partners or customers.
A failure to prevent inventory shortages or accurately predict customers’ needs could result in decreased revenue and gross margins and harm our business.
Some of our products and supplies may become obsolete or be deemed excess while in inventory due to rapidly changing customer specifications, changes in product structure, components or bills of material as a result of engineering changes, or a decrease in customer demand. We also have exposure to contractual liabilities to our contract manufacturers for inventories purchased by them on our behalf, based on our forecasted requirements, which may become excess or obsolete. Our inventory balances also represent an investment of cash. To the extent our inventory turns are slower than we anticipate based on historical practice, our cash conversion cycle extends and more of our cash remains invested in working capital. If we are not able to manage our inventory effectively, we may need to write down the value of some of our existing inventory or write off non-saleable or obsolete inventory. Any such charges we incur in future periods could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenue and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance.
If our tools contain defects or do not meet customer specifications, we could lose customers and revenue.
Highly complex tools such as ours may develop defects during the manufacturing and assembly process. We may also experience difficulties in customizing our tools to meet customer specifications or detecting defects during the development and manufacturing of our tools. Some of these failures may not be discovered until we have expended significant resources in customizing our tools, or until our tools have been installed in our customers’ production facilities. These quality problems could harm our reputation as well as our customer relationships in the following ways:
•
our customers may delay or reject acceptance of our tools that contain defects or fail to meet their specifications;
•
we may suffer customer dissatisfaction, negative publicity and reputational damage, resulting in reduced orders or otherwise damaging our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers;
•
we may incur substantial costs as a result of warranty claims or service obligations or in order to enhance the reliability of our tools;
•
the attention of our technical and management resources may be diverted;
•
we may be required to replace defective systems or invest significant capital to resolve these problems; and
•
we may be required to write off inventory and other assets related to our tools.
In addition, defects in our tools or our inability to meet the needs of our customers could cause damage to our customers’ products or manufacturing facilities, which could result in claims for product liability, tort or breach of warranty, including claims from our customers. The cost of defending such a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be substantial and could divert management’s attention from our ongoing operations. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate with respect to a claim or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, we may be liable for payment of substantial damages. Any or all of these potential consequences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
Warranty claims in excess of our estimates could adversely affect our business.
We have provided warranties against manufacturing defects of our tools that range from 12 to 36 months in duration. Our product warranty requires us to provide labor and parts necessary to repair defects. As of December 31, 2024, we had 
31
Table of Contents
accrued $12.7 million in liability contingency for potential warranty claims. Warranty claims substantially in excess of our expectations, or significant unexpected costs associated with warranty claims, could harm our reputation and could cause customers to decline to place new or additional orders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We rely on third parties to manufacture significant portions of our tools and our failure to manage our relationships with these parties could harm our relationships with our customers, increase our costs, decrease our sales and limit our growth.
Our tools are complex and require components and subassemblies having a high degree of reliability, accuracy and performance. We rely on third parties to manufacture most of the subassemblies and supply most of the components used in our tools. Accordingly, we cannot directly control our delivery schedules and
 quality assurance. This reliance on third parties and lack of control could result in shortages or quality assurance problems. See also “—Our supply chain may be materially adversely impacted due to global events, including public health issues, transportation delays, and the armed conflict in Ukraine.”

These issues and our ability to manage increased demand could delay shipments of our tools, increase our testing or production costs or lead to costly 
failure claims.
We do not have long-term supply contracts with some of our suppliers, and those suppliers are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any specific period, in any specific quantities or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. In addition, we attempt to maintain relatively low inventories and acquire subassemblies and components only as needed. There are significant risks associated with our reliance on these third-party suppliers, including:
•
potential price increases;
•
capacity shortages or other inability to meet any increase in demand for our products;
•
reduced control over manufacturing process for components and subassemblies and delivery schedules;
•
limited ability of some suppliers to manufacture and sell subassemblies or parts in the volumes we require and at acceptable quality levels and prices, due to the suppliers’ relatively small operations and limited manufacturing resources;
•
increased exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property; and
•
limited warranties on subassemblies and components supplied to us.
Any delays in the shipment of our products due to our reliance on third-party suppliers could harm our relationships with our customers. In addition, any increase in costs due to our suppliers increasing the price they charge us for subassemblies and components or arising from our need to replace our current suppliers that we are unable to pass on to our customers could negatively affect our operating results.
Our supply chain may be materially adversely impacted due to global events, including any new COVID‑19 outbreaks or other public health issues, transportation delays, and the armed conflict in Ukraine.
We rely upon the facilities of our global suppliers with operations in mainland China, Japan, Taiwan and the United States to support our business. We source the substantial majority of our components from Asia, and as a result, our supply chain can be 
adversely affected by a variety of global events, including transportation delays, including those related to the June 2022 truck driver strike in Korea resulting from escalated fuel prices, and the armed conflict in Ukraine. Further, our subsidiaries ACM Shanghai and ACM Korea were recently added to the BIS Entity List, which prohibit any party worldwide from furnishing hardware, software, or technology that are subject to U.S. export controls jurisdiction to ACM Shanghai or ACM Korea and could adversely impact our supply chain.

See “—Regulatory Risks—Our operations in mainland China and Korea, including the import of components, technology, and activities of U.S. personnel therein, may be further impacted by the addition of ACM Shanghai, ACM Korea and related entities to the BIS Entity List.”
As a result of these types of global events and resulting governmental regulations and business reactions, our suppliers may not have the materials, capacity, or capability to supply our components according to our schedule and specifications. Further, there may be logistics issues, including our ability and our supply chain’s ability to quickly ramp up production, labor issues and transportation demands that may cause further delays. Supply chain constraints have intensified, which may further intensify due to other global events and government regulations, contributing to existing global shortages coupled with increased demand in the supply of semiconductors. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, underutilized facilities, and loss of access to critical raw materials and parts for producing and supporting our tools, and could impact our ongoing capacity expansion and our ability to fulfill our product delivery obligations. If our suppliers’ operations are curtailed, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply, which may be more expensive and may not be available to us at all due to government regulations. Alternate sources may not be available or 
32
Table of Contents
may result in delays in shipments to us from our supply chain and subsequently to our customers, each of which would affect our results of operations. These types of disruptions and governmental restrictions may also result in the inability of our customers to obtain materials necessary for their full production, which could also result in reduced demand for our products. While certain disruptions and governmental restrictions, as well as related general limitations on movement around the world, may be temporary, the duration of the production and supply chain disruption, and related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time. Should these distributions and restrictions continue for an extended period of time, the impact on our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Business disruptions could also negatively affect the sources and availability of components and materials that are essential to the operation of our business. Moreover, our customers source a range of production equipment, supplies and services from other suppliers with operations around the world, and any reduction in supply capacity at those customers’ factories may reduce or even halt those customers’ production and result in a decrease in the demand for our products.
Any shortage of components or subassemblies could result in delayed delivery of products to us or in increased costs to us, which could harm our business.
The ability of our manufacturers to supply our tools is dependent, in part, upon the availability of certain components and subassemblies. Our manufacturers may experience shortages in the availability of such components or subassemblies, which could result in delayed delivery of products to us or in increased costs to us. Any shortage of components or subassemblies or any inability to control costs associated with manufacturing could increase the costs for our products or impair our ability to ship orders in a timely cost-efficient manner. As a result, we could experience cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in our prices and margins, any of which could harm our financial performance and results of operations.
We depend on a limited number of suppliers, including single source suppliers, for critical components and subassemblies, and our business could be disrupted if they are unable to meet our needs.
We depend on a limited number of suppliers for components and subassemblies used in our tools. Certain components and subassemblies of our tools have only been purchased from our current suppliers to date and changing the source of those components and subassemblies may result in disruptions during the transition process and entail significant delay and expense. 
We rely on: Product Systems, Inc., or ProSys, as the sole supplier of megasonic transducers, a key subassembly used in our semiconductor capital equipment; Ninebell Co., Ltd., or Ninebell, as the principal supplier of robotic delivery system subassemblies used in our semiconductor capital equipment; Advanced Electric Co. Inc., as a key supplier of valves used in our semiconductor capital equipment; and certain companies from other countries which supply components and subsystems used in our semiconductor capital equipment. An adverse change to our relationship with any of these suppliers, including a delay or the inability to export the components to mainland China, could disrupt our production of our semiconductor capital equipment and could cause substantial harm to our business.
With some of these suppliers, we do not have long-term agreements and instead purchase components and subassemblies through a purchase order process. As a result, these suppliers may stop supplying us components and subassemblies, limit the allocation of supply and equipment to us due to increased industry demand or significantly increase their prices at any time with little or no advance notice. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers could also result in delivery problems, reduced control over product pricing and quality, and our inability to identify and qualify another supplier in a timely manner.
Moreover, some of our suppliers may experience financial difficulties that could prevent them from supplying us with components or subassemblies used in the design and manufacture of our products. In addition, our suppliers, including our sole supplier ProSys, may experience manufacturing delays or shutdowns due to circumstances beyond their control, such as labor issues, political unrest or natural disasters. Any supply deficiencies could materially and adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and our results of operations. We have in the past and may in the future, experience delays or reductions in supply shipments, which could reduce our revenue and profitability. If key components or materials are unavailable, our costs would increase and our revenue would decline.
The success of our business will depend on our ability to manage any future growth.
We have experienced rapid growth in our business recently due, in part, to an expansion of our product offerings and an increase in the number of customers that we serve. For example, our headcount grew by 27% in 2024, 32% in 2023, and 38% in 2022. We will seek to continue to expand our operations in the future, including by adding new offices, locations and employees. Managing our growth has placed and could continue to place a significant strain on our management, other 
33
Table of Contents
personnel and our infrastructure. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, develop new products, enhance our technological capabilities, satisfy customer requirements, respond to competitive pressures or otherwise execute our business plan. In addition, any inability to manage our growth effectively could result in operating inefficiencies that could impair our competitive position and increase our costs disproportionately to the amount of growth we achieve. To manage our growth, we believe we must effectively:
•
hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for research and development activities, sales and marketing personnel, service and support personnel and financial and information technology personnel;
•
manage multiple relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties; and
•
continue to enhance our information technology infrastructure, systems and controls.
Our organizational structure has become more complex, including as a result of the STAR Listing and the STAR IPO. We will need to continue to scale and adapt our operational, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures, at both ACM Research and ACM Shanghai. The continued expansion of our infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and management resources before our revenue increases and without any assurances that our revenue will increase.
We are highly dependent on our Chief Executive Officer and President and other senior management and key employees.
Our success largely depends on the skills, experience and continued efforts of our management, technical and sales personnel, including in particular Dr. David H. Wang, the Chair of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President of ACM Research. All of our senior management are at-will employees, which means either we or the employee may terminate their employment at any time. If one or more of our other senior management personnel were unable or unwilling to continue their employment with us, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner. Moreover, in connection with the STAR Listing and the STAR IPO, ACM Shanghai is now managed by a group of officers separate from those of ACM Research and those officers owe fiduciary duties to the various stakeholders of ACM Shanghai. We do not have employment or retention agreements with, or maintain key person life insurance policies on, any of our employees. Our business may be severely disrupted and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our senior management may join a competitor or form a competing company. The loss of Dr. Wang or other key management personnel, including our Chief Financial Officer, could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives.
Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could put us at a competitive disadvantage and prevent us from effectively growing our business.
Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. There is substantial competition for experienced management, technical and sales personnel in the chip equipment industry. If qualified personnel become scarce or difficult to attract or retain for compensation-related or other reasons, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs. New hires may require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity and may not become as productive as we expect. If we are unable to retain and motivate our existing employees and attract qualified personnel to fill key positions, we may experience inadequate levels of staffing to develop and market our products and perform services for our customers, which could have a negative effect on our operating results.
Our ability to utilize certain U.S. and state net operating loss carryforwards may be limited under applicable tax laws.
As of December 31
, 2024, we had certain net operating loss carryforward amounts, or NOLs, of $2 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and $0.9 million for U.S. s
tate income tax purposes (note 18). As of December 31, 2023, we had NOLs, of $3.3 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and $0.6 million for U.S. state income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2022, we had NOLs of $4.4 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes and $0.5 million for U.S. state income tax purposes. 
Utilization of these NOLs could be subject to a substantial annual limitation if the ownership change limitations under U.S. Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383 and similar U.S. state provisions are triggered by changes in the ownership of our capital stock. Such an annual limitation would result in the expiration of the NOLs before utilization. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, including in connection with our initial public offering and concurrent private placement in November 2017, our follow-on public offering in August 2019, and any future equity issuances. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change. Regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, may 
34

cause our existing NOLs to expire or otherwise become unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Additionally, U.S. state NOLs generated in one state cannot be used to offset income generated in another U.S. state. For these reasons, we may be limited in our ability to realize tax benefits from the use of our NOLs, even if our profitability would otherwise allow for it.
Acquisitions that we pursue in the future, whether or not consummated, could result in other operating and financial difficulties.
In the future we may seek to acquire additional product lines, technologies or businesses in an effort to increase our growth, enhance our ability to compete, complement our product offerings, enter new and adjacent markets, obtain access to additional technical resources, enhance our intellectual property rights or pursue other competitive opportunities. We may also make investments in certain key suppliers to align our interests with such suppliers. If we seek acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates at prices we consider appropriate. We cannot readily predict the timing or size of our future acquisitions, or the success of any future acquisitions.
To the extent that we consummate acquisitions or investments, we may face financial risks as a result, including increased costs associated with merged or acquired operations, increased indebtedness, economic dilution to gross and operating profit and earnings per share, or unanticipated costs and liabilities. Acquisitions may involve additional risks, including:
•
the acquired product lines, technologies or businesses may not improve our financial and strategic position as planned;
•
we may determine we have overpaid for the product lines, technologies or businesses, or that the economic conditions underlying our acquisition have changed;
•
we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;
•
we may have difficulty retaining the employees with the technical skills needed to enhance and provide services with respect to the acquired product lines or technologies;
•
the acquisition may be viewed negatively by customers, employees, suppliers, financial markets or investors;
•
we may have difficulty incorporating the acquired product lines or technologies with our existing technologies;
•
we may encounter a competitive response, including price competition or intellectual property litigation;
•
we may encounter difficulties related to required CFIUS approval (see also “-Regulatory Risks-Certain of our investments may be subject to review by and approval from CFIUS, which may prevent us from taking advantage of investment opportunities that would otherwise be advantageous to our stockholders”);
•
we may become a party to product liability or intellectual property infringement claims as a result of our sale of the acquired company’s products;
•
we may incur one-time write-offs, such as acquired in-process research and development costs, and restructuring charges;
•
we may acquire goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests, which could result in future impairment charges;
•
our ongoing business and management’s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically or culturally diverse enterprises; and
•
our due diligence process may fail to identify significant existing issues with the target business.
From time to time, we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated. These negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time, as well as substantial out-of-pocket costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Declines in the semiconductor industry, or the overall world economic conditions on which the industry is significantly dependent, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of chip manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits. With the consolidation of customers within the industry, the chip capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers. Global economic and business conditions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. Additionally, in times of economic uncertainty our customers’ budgets for our tools, or their ability to access credit to purchase them, could be adversely affected. This would limit their ability to purchase our products and services. As a result, economic downturns could cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including:
•
a decline in demand for our products;
35
Table of Contents
•
an increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers’ inability to pay us;
•
an increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory;
•
valuation allowances on deferred tax assets;
•
restructuring charges;
•
asset impairments;
•
a decline in the value of our investments;
•
exposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition;
•
a decline in the value of certain facilities we lease to less than our residual value guarantee with the lessor; and
•
challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply.
Fluctuating levels of investment by chip manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenue, operating results and earnings. Where appropriate, we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which could result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results.
Regulatory Risks
Our ability to sell our tools to customers in mainland China and certain other countries has been impacted, and will likely continue to be materially and adversely impacted, by export license requirements, other regulatory changes, or other actions taken by the U.S. or other governmental agencies.
ACM Shanghai utilizes certain items subject to export controls under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) in manufacturing and supplying its products. The EAR applies to exports of commodities, software and technology from the United States, including for use in manufacturing products outside the United States, as well as to certain products manufactured outside the United States that incorporate, or are based on, designated U.S. content, software or technology. The Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce (BIS), which administers the EAR, recently imposed, and may continue to impose, additional restrictions under the EAR on certain exports to China, to include Hong Kong and Macau, including restrictions targeting the semiconductor manufacturing industry in China. These types of restrictions may impact the operations of ACM Shanghai.
In October 2022, BIS announced new rules that significantly expanded U.S. export controls as applied to advanced IC products, related manufacturing equipment and technology, and supercomputers, where the destination or ultimate end user is based in mainland China. In the case of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the new rules require an export license for the export, re-export, or transfer to or within mainland China of additional types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, items for use in manufacturing designated types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment (along with other items subject to the EAR, for use in the development or production of ICs), and semiconductor manufacturing equipment for use at certain IC manufacturing and development facilities in mainland China. In most cases, license applications for these exports are reviewed under a presumption of denial. In addition, BIS imposed new restrictions by which U.S. persons anywhere in the world are effectively barred from engaging in certain activities related to the development and production of semiconductors at mainland China fabrication facilities meeting specified criteria, even if no items subject to the EAR are involved. The October 2022 restrictions were later expanded to include Macau. 
These new restrictions have impacted the procurement by ACM Shanghai of certain items from the United States, and of certain items subject to U.S. export controls from outside the United States, for use in manufacturing its products.
In October 2023, BIS further expanded export controls on semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing items and items for use in manufacturing designated types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including through new licensing requirements covering a broader variety of items, and an expansion in the geographical scope of the controls.
There were further export control restrictions imposed in 2024.

BIS expanded export controls to limit distribution of high-performance ICs by restricting sales through customer allocations and imposing caps on specific countries.
ACM Shanghai has determined that several of its customers have mainland China-based facilities that meet the restricted criteria set out in the enhanced export control rules described above, and has also determined that several of its products, and/or components for its products, may meet the parameters of export control classification numbers, or ECCNs, affected by the restrictions. ACM and ACM Shanghai have implemented modifications to their existing business policies and 
36
Table of Contents
practices in response to these enhanced export restrictions, including by imposing limitations on the activities of their U.S. persons and undertaking measures in connection with their supply chains more broadly to comply with the new regulations. ACM Shanghai is continuing to assess the impact of these export control restrictions, and will continually adjust or modify its policies and practices as required to comply with these or other related updates. Based on our ongoing review, we believe these regulations may directly impact ACM Shanghai’s ability to meet its future production plans, or indirectly impact the spending plans of ACM Shanghai’s customer base. ACM may not be able to import, or may face substantial restrictions in importing, certain parts from the United States or parts subject to U.S. export controls from outside the United States to support tool shipments to such facilities, or to be embedded into tools defined by affected ECCNs.
We believe that as a result of the export control restrictions, several ACM Shanghai customers have significantly reduced production and related capital spending at facilities meeting the restricted advanced node capabilities. In addition, ACM Shanghai has experienced challenges as the companies in its supply chain adapt their policies to the new regulations. These factors had an adverse impact on ACM Shanghai’s shipments and sales in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. We anticipate these factors will continue to have an adverse impact on ACM Shanghai’s shipments and sales in future periods.
Alongside these new restrictions, BIS has also continued to designate additional China entities, many involved in the semiconductor manufacturing industry, on restricted party lists under the EAR, such as the Entity List and the Unverified List. These designations impose licensing requirements for the supply of products to such entities. In most cases, any items subject to the EAR, including foreign produced products with specified U.S. content or that are the product of specified U.S. origin software, technology, or equipment, now require an export license from BIS before they can be supplied to the newly listed China entities, regardless of their export classification. In December 2020, SMIC, one of the largest chip manufacturers in mainland China and one of our key customers, was one of numerous entities added to the Entity List. Challenges faced by SMIC and its key suppliers as a result of the listing have indirectly impacted SMIC’s demand for, and ACM Shanghai’s ability to supply, ACM Shanghai products. More recently, in October 2022, YMTC, a leading mainland China memory chip company and one of our key customers, was added to the Unverified List of the EAR alongside a number of other Chinese entities. The Unverified List identifies parties for whom BIS has been unable to confirm their bona fides (i.e., legitimacy and reliability about the end-use and end-user of items subject to the EAR). Entities listed on the Unverified List are ineligible to receive items subject to the EAR by means of a license exception if a U.S. export license is required. In December 2022, YMTC was moved from the Unverified List to the Entity List. Challenges faced by YMTC and its key suppliers as a result of the listing could indirectly impact YMTC’s demand for, or ACM Shanghai’s ability to supply, ACM Shanghai products.
We cannot be certain what additional actions the U.S. government may take with respect to China entities, or whether such actions will impact our relationships with our mainland China-based customers. Additional actions could take the form of further revisions to the Entity List or Unverified List, new export restrictions, further expansions to the geographic scope of the controls, or additional tariffs or other trade restrictions. It is also possible that other countries could adopt similar semiconductor-focused export controls to align with the October 2022 and October 2023 U.S. actions.
During the three and twelve months ended December 30, 2023, two prominent exporters of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the Netherlands and Japan, announced and began to implement plans to join the United States in imposing semiconductor-focused export controls.
On May 23, 2023, the Japanese government issued the final amendment to an ordinance implementing new export controls to require licensing for export of certain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, effective as of July 23, 2023.

The amendment expands the scope of export controls to prohibit (1) exporting 23 additional categories of items relating to semiconductor manufacturing and (2) providing technology relating to manufacturing, development or use of these categories of items, in both cases, without an advance license.

While the expanded export controls apply to exports to any jurisdiction, exports to certain jurisdictions, such as the United States, are expected to be permitted by certain types of broad general licenses. However, it remains to be seen whether the Japanese government will authorize any exports of these items to mainland China by a limited general license or specific license, if at all.
Likewise, on September 30, 2023, the Government of the Netherlands published additional export control measures for advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The Regulation on Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment entered force on September 1, 2023. From that point on, the export of certain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, as specified in the Annex to the Regulation, is now subject to a national export license authorization requirement by the Dutch Central Import and Export Service.

Efforts to further tighten semiconductor-related export controls have continued in 2024.

In December 2024, the Government of the Netherlands implemented supplemental export controls on certain emerging technology items including sensitive goods, software, and technology related to the semiconductor sector.
As a result of the new restrictions, the ability of ACM Shanghai to acquire such parts from Japan and the Netherlands to fulfill customer requirements, and the ability of ACM Shanghai’s customers in mainland China to scale their production, could be further negatively impacted by these additional controls. The introduction of additional multilateral semiconductor-focused export controls could further negatively impact ACM Shanghai’s supply arrangements. 
We are unable to predict the duration of the restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, Japan and the Netherlands or the

effects of any future governmental actions by the U.S., Japan, the Netherlands or other countries that may impact our relationships with our mainland China-based customers, any of which could have a long-term adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Effective on December 2, 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) promulgated a final rule naming a number of companies to the BIS Entity List (the "BIS Entity List"). Among the 140 companies added to the BIS Entity List were two subsidiaries of ACM Research,  ACM Shanghai, located in the People’s Republic of China, and ACM Korea, a direct subsidiary of ACM Shanghai, which is located in the Republic of Korea, and other related entities. In general terms, the new BIS Entity List designations prohibit any party worldwide from furnishing hardware, software, or technologies that are subject to U.S. export controls jurisdiction to ACM Shanghai or ACM Korea.
