Item 2. Properties
As of December 28, 2024, we had 5,179 company-operated, franchised, and independently-operated locations, and of these we owned 236 company-operated store locations and 99 independently-operated store locations. We held leases covering the building and/or land for 1,094 of our company-operated locations, 621 of our independently-operated locations, 6 distribution centers and 15 offices and training centers in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, including our corporate headquarters located in Charlotte, North Carolina. The leases generally have initial expiration dates ranging from 5 and 20 years, with certain renewal options available. We also leased 45 properties that were either leased or subleased principally to franchisees as of December 28, 2024. We believe that the properties are suitable and adequate for the Company’s business.
