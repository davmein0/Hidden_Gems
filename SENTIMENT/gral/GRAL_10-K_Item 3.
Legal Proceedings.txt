Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-K”) contains forward-looking statements. 
We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). 
In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “should,” “would,” or “will,” the negative of these terms, and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about us, may include expectations and projections of our future financial performance, future tests or products, technology, clinical studies, regulatory compliance, potential market opportunity, anticipated growth strategies, restructuring costs, sufficiency of cash on hand to finance our business, cost savings, budgets and strategies, restructuring and stock-based compensation costs, impact of the restructuring on our operations and anticipated trends in our business.
These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to differ materially and adversely from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should specifically consider the numerous factors and risks described under the section entitled “Risk Factors.” Moreover, we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to differ materially and adversely from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make.
Forward-looking statements relate to the future and, accordingly, are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Although we believe the expectations and projections expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance, or achievements. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-K to conform our prior statements to actual results or revised expectations or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Summary of Material Risks Associated with Our Business
The principal risks and uncertainties affecting our business include the following:
•
We operate in a rapidly evolving field and have a limited operating history, which make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance.
•
We have incurred significant net losses in each period since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the coming years. 
•
Our products or future products may not perform as expected, and the results of our clinical studies may not support the launch or use our products or future products and may not comply with the requirements, or be replicated in later studies or in the post-market or real-world setting, required to support a commercial opportunity or for any necessary or desirable regulatory clearances, approvals, or certifications, or reimbursement or coverage. 
•
The clinical study process is lengthy and expensive with uncertain outcomes. We have encountered delays and may encounter future delays in, or unexpected data from, our clinical studies, and may therefore be unable to complete our clinical studies on the timelines we expect, if at all.
•
A substantial majority of our revenue is generated from sales of Galleri and we are highly dependent on it for our success.
•
If our products do not receive adequate coverage and reimbursement, if at all, from third-party payors, our ability to expand access to our products and our overall commercial success beyond our existing sales channels will be limited.
•
Our commercial products may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance necessary for commercial success.
•
We have launched Galleri as a laboratory developed test (“LDT”) in the United States. The FDA recently finalized a regulation pursuant to which it plans to subject LDTs to medical device requirements through a phase-out of its historical policy of enforcement discretion over LDTs over a period of four years. The phase-in of medical device requirements to LDTs, including the potential requirement for FDA marketing authorization, if it imposes significant obligations in advance of our timeline or readiness, will be costly and time-consuming.
•
The regulatory clearance, approval, or certification processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities or notified bodies are lengthy, time-consuming, and unpredictable. 
•
Our multi-cancer detection tests are a new approach to cancer screening, which present a number of novel and complex issues for FDA review. Because the FDA has never cleared or approved a multi-cancer detection test, we cannot provide assurances regarding information we will need to submit to obtain approval of a PMA from the FDA for a proposed intended use, or if we will be able to obtain such approval on a timely basis or at all.
•
We may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to offset our ongoing operating expenses and achieve and maintain profitability, and it may be difficult for us to offset the costs of our royalties, including the high single-digit royalty that we will be required to pay to Illumina in perpetuity or our royalties payable to the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
•
We may be unable to develop and commercialize new products, including enhanced versions of current products.
•
If similar third-party products are developed and do not perform as intended or cause harm or injury to patients, the market for our products could be impaired.

•
If we fail to obtain additional financing, we may be unable to expand our commercialization efforts, or to develop and commercialize additional products.
•
If our products result in direct or indirect participant or patient harm or injury, we could be subject to significant reputational and liability risks.
•
We rely on Illumina as a sole supplier for our next-generation sequencers and associated reagents, Madison Industries as a sole supplier of blood collection tubes, and Twist Bioscience Corporation as a sole supplier of DNA panels. Additionally, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for some of our laboratory instruments and reagents, and we may not be able to immediately find replacements if necessary.
•
If our facilities become inoperable, our ability to provide our products will be significantly impaired and our business will be harmed.
•
Our operations and business are materially dependent on various third parties, including information technology, sample collection, processing, transfer facilities, and other patient-facing service providers, any of which could experience disruption, failure, or interruption.
•
If we are unable to scale our operations successfully to support demand for our products, our business could suffer.
•
If we are not successful in attracting, motivating, and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.
•
Our information technology systems, or those used by our third-party collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer cybersecurity incidents or cyberattacks.
•
Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.
•
If we are unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our technology, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection we obtain is not sufficiently broad, third parties could in the future develop and commercialize technology and tests similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our products may be impaired.
•
If we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.
•
We could have an indemnification obligation to Illumina if the Distribution were determined not to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal tax purposes.
•
We have agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition treatment of the Spin-Off, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.
The summary risk factors described above should be read together with the text of the full risk factors below in “Risk Factors” and the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as in other documents that we file with the SEC. The risks summarized above or described in full below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not precisely known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects.
