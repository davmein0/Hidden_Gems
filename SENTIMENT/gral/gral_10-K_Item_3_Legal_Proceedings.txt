Holders of record
As of February 27, 2025, there were 463 holders of record of our common stock. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.

We currently anticipate that we will retain all available funds for use in the operation and expansion of our business.
