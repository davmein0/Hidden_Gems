Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
You should read the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition together with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included under Item 8. “Financial Statements”. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry and our business and financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K and the section titled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
GRAIL, LLC, previously named SDG Ops, LLC, was formed in the state of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of Illumina, Inc. (“Illumina”). SDG Ops, LLC, along with SDG Ops, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Illumina, were formed for the purpose of completing a merger transaction between GRAIL, Inc., and Illumina (the “Acquisition”) in order to carry on the business of GRAIL, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
On September 20, 2020, GRAIL, Inc., Illumina and its subsidiaries, SDG Ops, LLC, and SDG Ops, Inc., entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”). On August 18, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Illumina completed its acquisition of GRAIL, Inc.. According to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, SDG Ops, Inc. and GRAIL, Inc. merged, with GRAIL, Inc. surviving and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Illumina (the “First Merger”). Immediately following the First Merger and as part of the same overall transaction, GRAIL, Inc., as the surviving corporation, merged with SDG Ops, LLC (the “Second Merger”). According to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, SDG Ops, LLC became the surviving company and was renamed GRAIL, LLC.
On June 24, 2024, Illumina completed the previously announced spin-off of GRAIL (the “Spin-Off”) through a distribution of approximately 85.5% of our outstanding common stock to the holders of record of Illumina’s common stock as of the close of business on June 13, 2024 (the “Distribution”). As a result of this Distribution, GRAIL became an independent public entity. 
Unless the context otherwise requires, references to "GRAIL," “we,” “us,” and the "Company" refer to (i) GRAIL, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Spin-Off as a carve-out business of Illumina and (ii) GRAIL, Inc. and its subsidiaries following the Spin-Off.
A detailed discussion comparing our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and January 2, 2022 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our final Information Statement filed with our Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended, as filed with the SEC.
Overview
Our Business
We are an innovative commercial-stage healthcare company focused on saving lives and shifting the paradigm in early cancer detection. We believe screening individuals for many types of cancer with a single test represents a significant opportunity to reduce the global burden of cancer. Our Galleri test is a commercially available screening test for early detection of multiple types of cancer, which we termed multi-cancer early detection (“MCED”). We believe Galleri is clinically validated based on the results of its clinical studies completed to date, including the results of its foundational case-control Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas (“CCGA”) study and interventional PATHFINDER study which together enrolled more than 21,000 participants. In these studies, Galleri demonstrated an ability to detect a shared cancer signal across more than 50 types of cancer, accurately predict the specific organ or tissue type where the cancer signal originated, and yield high positive predictive values and low false positive rates, all from a simple blood draw. Galleri results can help guide next steps for diagnosis of cancer by healthcare providers in required follow-up diagnostic testing. We launched Galleri in the United States in mid-2021. We have sold more than 290,000 commercial tests which have detected some of the most aggressive cancers in early stages including, among others, endometrial, esophageal, gastric, head and neck, liver, pancreatic, and rectal cancers.

Since our inception, we have incurred net losses each year. Our net losses were 
$2.0 billion for fiscal year 2024 (
which includes 
$1.4 billion
 of goodwill and intangible assets impairment), 
$1.5 billion
 for fiscal year 
2023
 (which includes 
$718.5 million
 of goodwill and intangible assets impairment), and 
$5.4 billion
 for fiscal year 
2022
 (which includes 
$4.7 billion
 in goodwill impairment), (see “Basis of Presentation” below for a description of applicable fiscal periods). Adjusted EBITDA was 
$(483.5) million for fiscal year 2024, $(523.9) million
 for fiscal year 
2023
, and 
$(500.1) million
 for fiscal year 
2022
. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principle (“GAAP”) financial measure, information about why we consider Adjusted EBITDA useful and a discussion of the material risks and limitations of these measures, please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from the application of pushdown accounting, including goodwill and intangible assets impairment, amortization of intangible assets, as well as our research and development programs, general and administrative (“G&A”) costs associated with our operations and sales and marketing costs associated with commercializing our products. Additionally, due to the application of pushdown accounting, our balance sheet includes intangible assets recognized by Illumina in connection with their acquisition of us that may be subject to additional impairment over time. We expect to continue to incur operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue to invest in research and development and commercialization of existing products.
Separation from Illumina
On June 24, 2024, Illumina completed the Spin-Off, as described above. See 
Note 1 — Organization And Description Of Business 
for details. In connection with the Spin-Off, certain equity and liability classified awards were converted in accordance with the employee matters agreement, as further described in 
Note 7 — Stock-Based Compensation
. As a result of the separation, our member’s equity balance was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.
On June 21, 2024, in connection with the Spin-Off, we received a cash contribution of $932.3 million from Illumina. In connection with the Spin-Off, we incurred $22.2 million of legal and professional fees in the year ended December 31, 2024 related to the 2021 acquisition of GRAIL by Illumina, and corresponding antitrust litigation, including compliance and divestiture of GRAIL from Illumina through the Spin-Off. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures — Adjusted EBITDA” for further details. In addition, from 2021 to 2024, we spent $143.8 million on legal and professional service fees related to the antitrust litigation and compliance with the hold separate order and transaction costs related to Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL and the Spin-Off.
Restructuring Plan
On August 9, 2024, following a portfolio review, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a restructuring plan (“Restructuring Plan”) designed to reprioritize our resources to focus on our core MCED business and reduce overall spend as we progress towards completion of registrational studies and premarket approval application (“PMA”) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for Galleri. 
 As a result, we have taken actions to streamline our commercial sales forces and focus their field-based activities on the current customers expected to be more productive and high priority opportunities. We maintained sales force coverage for the majority of our current Galleri volume and active prescribers. As part of this approach, we also streamlined our current and planned investment in our enterprise business, which included our employer and life insurance businesses. Reductions in the commercial organization included management layers and commercial roles without sales responsibilities. In addition to reductions in the commercial organization, we made reductions in medical affairs teams involved with U.S. Galleri provider engagement.
We also substantially decreased investment and planned investment in research and development activities related to our product programs beyond Galleri, including our diagnostic aid for cancer and minimal residual disease programs. In addition, we made reductions in general and administrative expenses to reflect the focus on the MCED opportunity. We plan to continue to invest in our biopharmaceutical partnerships and work with our partners to leverage our proprietary methylation technology in precision oncology applications.

The decision was based on cost-reduction initiatives intended to reduce our ongoing operating expenses and maximize shareholder value.
The Restructuring Plan included a reduction in our existing headcount and planned 2024 hires of approximately 30%, inclusive of 350 then full-time employees, or approximately 25% of the workforce in place as of June 30, 2024.
The Restructuring Plan was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, and we incurred approximately $18.3 million of total charges for the year ended December 31, 2024, consisting primarily of employee severance, benefits, payroll taxes, and other associated costs. We expect the headcount reductions to enable future cost savings of approximately $120 million on an annual basis. We estimate that the Restructuring Plan extends our anticipated cash runway from the second half of 2026 into 2028.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a standalone basis using the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Illumina prior to the Spin-Off, and the accounting records of GRAIL, Inc. subsequent to the Spin-Off. These consolidated financial statements reflect GRAIL’s consolidated historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows as historically managed, in accordance with GAAP. The Consolidated Financial Statements may not be indicative of GRAIL’s future performance and do not necessarily reflect what the financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been, and may not include all expenses that would have been incurred, had GRAIL been operated as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented. Certain situations require management to make estimates based on judgments and assumptions, which may affect the reported amounts of assets and respective disclosures at the date of the financial statements. Management’s judgments and assumptions may also affect the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these management estimates.
While GRAIL was a subsidiary of Illumina, GRAIL’s fiscal year was the 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to December 31, with quarters of 13 or 14 weeks ending the Sunday closest to March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. References to
 “fiscal year 
2023
” refer to the period from January 2, 2023 to December 31, 2023, and “fiscal year 
2024
” refer to the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024
. Upon the closing of the Spin-Off, GRAIL adopted a fiscal year end of December 31. 
Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL on August 18, 2021 (“the Acquisition”) represented a change of control with respect to GRAIL. Given GRAIL, Inc. merged with SDG Ops, Inc., which then merged with SDG Ops LLC, authoritative guidance (ASC 805-50-30) required pushdown accounting to be applied for the Second Merger amongst entities under common control.
 As a result of the application of pushdown accounting, the separately issued financial statements of GRAIL reflect Illumina’s basis in the assets and liabilities of GRAIL which were remeasured to fair value as of the 
Closing Date
. Intangible assets included developed technology, in-process research and development, and trade names, as well as goodwill. 
We expect to incur additional costs as a separate public company. These additional costs are primarily related to certain supporting functions that may differ from and be higher than the costs historically incurred or allocated to us.
The additional costs we expect to incur as a separate public company are summarized as follows:
•
Accounting and audit related costs, professional services, and new systems and software to support the accounting, financial reporting, and audits as a standalone public company;
•
Professional service costs, for additional support to enhance our capabilities in areas such as investor relations, accounting, financial reporting, treasury, risk management, and equity administration, among others; and
108
Table
 of 
Contents
•
Corporate governance costs, including but not limited to board of directors compensation and expenses, insurance, legal and other professional services fees, annual report and proxy statement costs, SEC filing fees, transfer agent fees, and stock exchange listing fees.
In addition, we have entered into a supply and commercialization agreement with Illumina. Under the terms of the agreement, regardless of whether our products incorporate any Illumina technology, we have agreed to pay to Illumina a high single-digit royalty, subject to certain reductions, in perpetuity on net sales generated by our products or revenues otherwise generated or received by us, subject to certain exceptions, in the field of oncology. Per the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement with Illumina, the royalty arrangement is suspended until the earlier of December 24, 2026 or any earlier GRAIL Change of Control (as defined in that agreement), at which time the high-single digit royalty will become payable.
Certain factors could impact the nature and amount of these separate public company costs, including the finalization of our staffing and infrastructure needs
.
Key Factors Affecting Performance
We believe there are several important factors that have impacted and that we expect will impact our operating performance and results of operations, including:
•
FDA and other regulatory approval and reimbursement
.
 Our performance will be impacted by the extent to which we can secure reimbursement and coverage for Galleri. Prior to broader coverage and reimbursement in the United States, we will continue our work with clinics and health systems to accelerate utilization, and with self-insured employers and health insurers to offer and cover Galleri. Galleri is currently available as a laboratory developed test (“LDT”) in the United States and we have established private reimbursement from a number of self-insured employers and health plans, but do not currently have broader coverage and reimbursement by government healthcare programs, such as Medicare. While Galleri has not been approved or cleared by the FDA, FDA approval is currently not required to market our test in the United States. We plan to pursue FDA approval to help support broad access for Galleri in the United States. We plan to complete a PMA submission with the FDA in the first half of 2026. The timing of this submission is subject to various risks and other factors, including the completion of clinical studies and our ongoing discussions with the FDA. Obtaining PMA approval can take several years from the time an application is submitted, if at all. Moreover, the FDA requirements that will govern MCED tests, as well as the breadth and nature of data we must provide the FDA to support the proposed intended use, may be subject to change, and as such it is difficult to predict what information we will need to submit to obtain approval of a PMA from the FDA for a proposed intended use. We continue to interact with the FDA regarding the data we must provide the FDA to support our PMA submission for the proposed intended use. We believe that FDA approval, if obtained, could unlock large commercial payors in the United States and we are supporting proposed legislation in the United States to enable coverage of FDA-approved MCED tests by Medicare. If we obtain FDA approval, we expect to pursue inclusion of Galleri in the USPSTF’s guideline recommendation, although such inclusion is not certain even with FDA approval. We believe such inclusion would further increase adoption and market acceptance of our tests. Over time, to the extent Galleri becomes more accessible in the United States, we may opt to reduce pricing in order to access a broader population base and accelerate adoption. In the United Kingdom, we are working with NHS England to complete our NHS-Galleri Trial. The NHS will evaluate the final results from the NHS-Galleri Trial, which are expected to be available in 2026, before determining whether to implement the Galleri test in the NHS. We believe the decision will include considerations such as NHS budget, political priorities, cost-effectiveness and implementation constraints in addition to an evaluation of the final results. We believe our work with the NHS and data generated from our NHS-Galleri Trial, if favorable, could help facilitate adoption in other single-payor systems around the world and support evidence of clinical utility worldwide.
•
International expansion
. A component of our long-term growth strategy is to expand our commercial reach internationally. We have expanded our research internationally into the United Kingdom through our partnership with NHS England in the NHS-Galleri Trial, and we expect to launch Galleri in the United Kingdom subject to the results of our NHS-Galleri Trial. We continue to evaluate international expansion 
109
Table

Contents
opportunities and we have begun expansion in select additional geographies through distributors. We expect to continue selectively engaging with international opportunities over time. 
•
Continued development of the market for MCED testing
.
 Multi-cancer early detection is a relatively novel technology and the market for MCED tests is evolving. We continue to drive MCED as a solution to one of healthcare’s most important challenges. Our performance depends on the extent to which key stakeholders, including current and potential commercial partners, payors and health systems, regulators, policy makers, academic and community medical centers, and key opinion leaders and advocates, understand and support MCED testing as an effective solution for cancer screening. We make significant efforts to educate these key stakeholders regarding the benefits of MCED and the clinical and economic value of our products, which we believe will continue to drive awareness of MCED and expand the commercial opportunity for our products.
•
Demand for our products and customer mix
.
 A key factor to our future success is and will be our ability to increase demand for, and sales of, Galleri from new and existing customers. Our commercial strategy is focused on innovative value-oriented partnerships and targets health systems, employers, payors, and life insurance providers. As Galleri is not currently broadly reimbursed, our ability to drive demand from these customers is directly linked to our ability to demonstrate the clinical and economic value of our test through clinical validation and real-world experience. As of December 31, 2024, we have entered into commercial partnerships, including with leading healthcare systems, employers, payors, and life insurance providers, and have established a network of over 13,000 prescribers across the United States in a pre-reimbursement setting. We believe this commercial network represents a significant opportunity to drive further demand for Galleri. The mix of customers from which we generate revenue from period to period has an impact on our revenue and gross margin. Galleri test pricing is generally based on our list price or, for certain customers, such as larger, higher-volume customers, negotiated contractual rates. For certain customers, we also offer rebates or discounts from time to time. Revenue generated from customers with negotiated contractual rates, or with rebates or discounts, is generally lower margin as compared to revenue generated based on list pricing. In addition, we have entered into a number of biopharmaceutical research partnerships for our research-use-only (“RUO”) offering under our precision oncology portfolio. Large customers, such as healthcare systems, employers, and biopharmaceutical partners, generally begin using our products by initiating pilots involving a limited number of tests. We believe that our ability to convert these initial pilots into long-term customer relationships has the potential to drive substantial long-term revenue. We also expect to increase demand from new customers through our efforts to further develop the market for MCED testing.
•
Investment in clinical studies and innovation to support our strategy and growth
.
 A significant aspect of our business is our investment in research and development and the ongoing evidence generation supporting the clinical performance and utility of Galleri. In particular, we have invested heavily in clinical studies and designed and executed what we believe is the largest clinical program in genomic medicine to date. These studies include: CCGA, NHS-Galleri, PATHFINDER, PATHFINDER 2, REACH/Galleri-Medicare, REFLECTION, STRIVE, SUMMIT, and SYMPLIFY. We have established and maintained a leading voice in conversations regarding the early detection of multiple cancer types in the peer-reviewed literature. We have published data from these studies in high-profile journals and have presented such data at renowned medical conferences. We believe these studies are critical to driving adoption of our tests, as well as favorable coverage decisions, and expect to continue investment in data generation. In addition, we have invested heavily in the development of our methylation platform and extensive technological infrastructure. We expect our research and development expenses to decrease over the next three years as, in conjunction with our portfolio review, we determined to decrease investment in product programs beyond Galleri. Additionally, some of our large clinical trials are moving into follow-up phase and the development of our automated platform is expected to substantially conclude in 2025. We will continue to prioritize key objectives for Galleri, including completion of our registrational studies and our premarket approval application.
•
Leverage our operational infrastructure
. We have made significant investments to build a scalable infrastructure capable of meeting significant demand while satisfying applicable certification requirements. Our Durham, North Carolina facility is able to process a substantial number of tests 
110
Table
 of 
Contents
annually and is CAP-accredited and CLIA-certified. In addition, we engineered custom technology infrastructure and cloud-based tools to enable scalable data collection and analysis capabilities. With this foundational infrastructure in place, we have been able to generate scale efficiencies as the volume of tests sold has increased. As demand for our products increases, we expect to further leverage the scale efficiencies of our infrastructure and platform technology, which we believe will positively impact margins over time. In the future, it is possible that we may invest significant amounts in infrastructure to support new products or existing products in new markets.
While each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us, they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must address. See “Risk Factors” for more information.
Components of Results of Operations
Screening Revenue
We currently derive screening revenue through the sale of Galleri primarily within the United States and primarily through primary care physicians, health systems, employers, payors, and life insurance providers. Galleri is not currently broadly reimbursed. The test price is based on the negotiated contractual rate with our contracted customers, otherwise our standard list price applies. We identify each sale of our test to our customer as a single performance obligation; therefore, revenue is recognized at the point of time when the test result report is delivered. For self-pay patients, we have concluded that an implied contract exists, however the transaction price for the implied contract represents variable consideration as there are situations in which we do not expect to collect the full invoiced amounts from self-pay patients due to price concessions. We utilize the expected value approach to estimate the transaction price and apply a constraint for such variable consideration, on a portfolio basis. We monitor the estimated amounts to be collected at each reporting period based on actual cash collections in order to assess whether a revision to the estimate is required.
Development Services Revenue
We also derive revenue through our development services, which consist of research services we provide to biopharmaceutical and clinical customers including support of ongoing clinical studies, pilot testing, research, and therapy development. We evaluate the terms and conditions included within our development services contracts with biopharmaceutical customers to ensure appropriate revenue recognition, including whether services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together. Revenue from pilot and research services performed is recognized as performance obligations are achieved. We recognize revenue from development service agreements related to regulatory filing to support clinical study and companion diagnostic device development and regulatory submissions for the developed product(s) using an input method based on costs incurred to measure its progress toward the completion and satisfaction of the performance obligations.
Cost of Screening Revenue (Exclusive of Amortization of Intangible Assets) and Cost of Development Services Revenue
Cost of revenue represents expenses that are incurred to produce and sell our products and services. For screening revenue, these costs consist of materials, labor including salaries and wages, bonus, benefits and stock-based compensation, blood collection kits and shipping, phlebotomy, royalties, electronic medical records, equipment depreciation, and allocations of overhead expenses such as facilities and information technology costs. For development services, these costs consist of materials and patient sample acquisition, labor including salaries and wages, bonus, benefits and stock-based compensation, royalties, equipment depreciation, and allocations of overhead expenses such as facilities and information technology costs.
Cost of Revenue—Amortization of Intangible Assets
As a result of the application of pushdown accounting, intangible assets recognized in our standalone financial statements relate to our own technology, and consist of developed technologies and in-process research and development that were measured at fair value upon the Acquisition. Our developed technology includes intangible assets related to Galleri, designed as a cancer screening test for asymptomatic individuals over 50 
111
Table
 of 
Contents
years of age, as well as our diagnostic aid for cancer (“DAC”) that is being designed to accelerate diagnostic resolution for patients for whom there is a clinical suspicion of cancer. As part of our Restructuring Plan, we have reduced, and are further reducing, investment in the development of products beyond Galleri, including DAC. The cost of identifiable intangible assets with finite lives, such as developed technology assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets’ respective estimated useful lives of 18 years.
Research and Development 
Research and development expenses include costs incurred to develop our technology (prior to establishing technological feasibility), collect clinical samples, and conduct clinical studies to develop and support our products. These costs consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense associated with our research and development personnel, costs associated with setting up and conducting clinical studies at domestic and international sites, laboratory supplies, consulting costs, depreciation, and allocated overhead including facilities and information technology expenses, which we do not allocate by product. We expense both internal and external research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used or rendered in future research and development activities are deferred and recognized as expense in the period in which the related goods are delivered or services are performed. We expect our
 research and development expenses to decrease over the next three years as, in conjunction with our portfolio review, we determined to decrease investment in product programs beyond Galleri. Additionally, some of our large clinical studies and development of our automated platform are expected to substantially conclude in this period
.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock- based compensation expense, consulting costs, allocated overhead including facilities and information technology expenses, and travel associated with our commercial organization. Also included are costs associated with advertising programs that consist of brand and product awareness activities and trade events and conferences. Sales and marketing expense also includes amortization of the trade name intangible asset that was recognized upon the Acquisition, which has been recorded in our financial statements as a result of the application of pushdown accounting. The cost of identifiable intangible assets with finite lives, such as trade names, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets’ respective estimated useful lives of 9 years. We expect our sales and marketing expenses 
to decrease in the near term following implementation of the Restructuring Plan in the third and fourth quarter 2024, and then to remain flat-to-increasing and continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the next three years and long term
.
General and Administrative 
G&A expenses consist of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, for executive, finance and accounting, legal, human resources, business development, corporate communications, medical affairs and management information systems personnel. Also included are professional fees, legal costs, including patent and trademark-related expenses and educational activities. The related party amount represents allocated stock administration expenses from Illumina. We have incurred and will incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, director and officer insurance premiums, investor relations activities, and other expenses related to administrative and professional services. We expect our G&A expenses to decrease in the near term following implementation of the Restructuring Plan in the third and fourth quarter 2024, and then remain flat-to-increasing and continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the next three years and long term.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairments
Upon the Acquisition, excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed, was recognized by Illumina as goodwill. As a result of the application of pushdown accounting, the separately issued financial statements of GRAIL reflect the goodwill recorded by Illumina upon the Acquisition.
112
Table
 of 
Contents
On July 13, 2022, the European General Court ruled that the European Commission had jurisdiction under the European Union Merger Regulation to review the Acquisition. Additionally, on September 6, 2022, the European Commission issued a decision prohibiting the Acquisition. These decisions constituted substantive changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill. We recognized a goodwill impairment for $4.7 billion in 2022. In the third quarter of 2023, we concluded the sustained decrease in Illumina’s stock price and overall market capitalization during the quarter was a triggering event indicating the fair value of GRAIL might be less than its carrying amount that led us to test goodwill for impairment. We recognized an additional goodwill impairment of $608.5 million in 2023 primarily due to changes to expected timing of revenue and a higher discount rate. In the second quarter of 2024, 
prior to the Spin-Off, the approval of the Spin-Off by Illumina’s board of directors represented a potential indicator of impairment which also aligned with the timing of Illumina’s annual goodwill impairment test date for 2024. We recognized

a goodwill impairment

of $888.9 million

as a result

of the impairment assessment,

primarily

due

to

changes

to
 the forecast of GRAIL’s value and the method for valuing GRAIL
.

In conjunction with the third quarter of 2023 goodwill impairment assessment described above, the Company also evaluated the IPR&D intangible asset for potential impairment. Based on the impairment test performed, the Company recognized an impairment of $110.0 million, primarily due to a decrease in projected cash flows and a higher discount rate selected for the fair value calculation. In conjunction

with Illumina’s second quarter of 2024 goodwill impairment

assessment,

the IPR&D intangible

asset of the GRAIL reporting unit was evaluated for

potential

impairment by Illumina prior to the Spin-Off.

Based

on

the

impairment

test

performed,

the Company recognized

an impairment

of $420.0 million primarily due to changes to revenue projections and the discount rate utilized. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, the Company performed a portfolio review and determined to decrease investment in the development of the IPR&D asset, which impacted the amount and timing of expected future cash flows attributable to IPR&D which represented a potential impairment indicator. Based

on

the

impairment

test

performed,

the Company recognized

an additional impairment

of $112.0 million,

primarily

due to a decrease

in projected

cash flows. 
We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. See “
Note 2 — Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies
—Goodwill and Intangible Assets” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Interest Income
Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and short term marketable securities.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as a result of our intercompany agreements.
Benefit from Income Taxes
Upon closing of the Acquisition, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Illumina, we were no longer subject to U.S. income tax on a standalone basis and U.S. income tax was combined into Illumina’s consolidated income tax return as a subsidiary of Illumina. However, for financial statement purposes, we have elected to compute our income tax provision, including current and deferred taxes, as if we filed a separate income tax return and were not included in Illumina’s consolidated return for the period GRAIL was owned by Illumina. Including the provision for income taxes in our standalone financials is more representative of our financial position as a standalone company. As such, the income tax provisions and related deferred tax assets and liabilities reflected in our financial statements for the periods ending December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 have been estimated as if we were a separate taxpayer.
Under this method, various tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits, are also presented on a separate return basis. For income tax purposes, since we were not a separate taxpayer and merely a subsidiary of Illumina, these tax attributes, including net operating losses and tax credits, are the property of 
113

Contents
Illumina and have either already been utilized by Illumina in its consolidated or combined income tax returns or will be utilized by Illumina in its returns in the future. Accordingly, such tax attributes will not be available to us as a standalone entity on our income tax returns in the future; therefore, in connection with the Spin-off, we recorded an entry to additional paid in capital in order to remove the tax-effected deferred tax assets, net of any valuation allowance, for the tax attributes that remained the property of Illumina. Following the Spin-off, as a standalone entity, GRAIL files tax returns on its own behalf and its deferred taxes and actual income tax rate may differ from those in historical periods.

Screening Revenue 
The 
increase
 in screening revenue of 
$33.6 million
 was 
primarily driven by
 a 46% increase in Galleri sales volume, offset by a 1% decrease in average selling price (“ASP”). The Galleri sales volume increased in 2024 as a result of the continued ramp in our commercial activity and partnerships, expansion of our network of ordering providers, increased orders from existing providers and new promotional campaigns.
Development Services Revenue
The 
decrease
 in development services revenue of 
$1.1 million
 was 
primarily due to
 a decrease of $0.8 million in revenue from pilots with biopharmaceutical partners as a result of milestones earned in 2023 that did not reoccur and a decrease of $1.1 million in other services revenue, partially offset by an increase of $0.6 million in clinical development revenue and an increase of $0.2 million in revenue earned from research services.

The 
decrease
 in the 
research and development
 expenses of 
$16.4 million
 was 
primarily attributable to the decrease in compensation expenses and clinical studies. 
The decrease of $11.6 million in compensation expenses was primarily related to a decrease of $9.1 million in stock-based compensation, a decrease of $8.0 million in salaries and wages and a decrease of $3.2 million in variable compensation expense primarily due to the reduction in workforce related to the Restructuring Plan, partially offset by an increase of $8.7 million in severance and benefits related to the Restructuring Plan. 
The decrease in clinical studies of $10.7 million was primarily due to completion of enrollment in our PATHFINDER 2 study and completion of final study visits in our NHS-Galleri Trial
. 
The increase in laboratory supplies and research collaboration expenses of $1.3 million was primarily driven by the development and validation of our automated platform. 
The increase of $3.0 million in allocated expenses was primarily attributable to higher software, IT, and facilities expenses being allocated to the research and development function.
The decrease in depreciation expenses of $1.4 million was primarily driven by fully depreciated assets.
The increase of $2.9 million in other expenses was primarily driven by an increase of $1.9 million in minimum royalty and intellectual property-related expenses, an increase of $1.3 million in the use of contractors and temporary labor, partially offset by a decrease of $0.3 million in cloud computing expenses primarily due to cost optimization efforts.

, partially offset by a $4.9 million 
increase in severance and benefits related to the Restructuring Plan. Third-party marketing professional services expenses decreased by $2.2 million primarily due to a reduction in marketing event activities. Other expenses decreased by $3.6 million primarily due to decreases in allocated facilities expenses as a result of reductions in sales and marketing headcount.

As a result of a goodwill impairment assessment performed by Illumina in the second quarter of 2024, a goodwill impairment charge of $888.9 million was recorded, which represents the amount by which the net carrying value of GRAIL exceeded the fair value of GRAIL at the time the quantitative test was performed, primarily due to changes to the 
forecast of GRAIL’s value and the method for valuing GRAIL
. In conjunction with the goodwill impairment assessment, an impairment assessment for our IPR&D intangible assets was performed by Illumina which resulted an impairment charge of $420.0 million primarily due to changes to revenue projections and the discount rate utilized. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, in conjunction with a portfolio review, we determined to reduce investment in the development of the IPR&D asset, which impacted the amount and timing of expected future cash flows attributable to IPR&D which we concluded was a possible indicator of impairment and another IPR&D impairment test was performed. The impairment assessment resulted in an additional impairment charge of $112.0 million primarily due to a decrease

in projected

cash flows.
As a result of an impairment assessment performed by Illumina in the third quarter of 2023, a goodwill impairment charge of $608.5 million was recorded which represents the amount by which the carrying value of GRAIL exceeded the fair value of GRAIL upon performing a quantitative test, primarily due to changes to expected timing of revenue and a higher discount rate. In conjunction with the 2023 impairment assessment, an impairment charge of $110.0 million was recorded to the IPR&D intangible asset.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results provided throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are determined in accordance with GAAP, this Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes the following non-GAAP financial measures for fiscal year 
2024 and
 fiscal year 
2023
, which information should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:
Adjusted Gross Profit/(Loss)
Adjusted Gross Profit/(Loss) is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our operational performance, as it represents the results of revenues and direct costs, which are key components of our operations. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors and other interested parties in analyzing our financial performance because it reflects the gross profitability of our operations, and excludes the costs associated with our sales and marketing, product development, general and administrative activities, and depreciation and amortization, and the impact of our financing methods and income taxes.
We calculate Adjusted Gross Profit/(Loss) as gross profit/(loss) (as defined below) adjusted to exclude amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation allocated to cost of revenue. Adjusted Gross Profit/(Loss) should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss from operations, net earnings or loss and other GAAP measures of income (loss) or profitability. The following table presents a reconciliation of gross loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted Gross Profit.

Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our financial performance and is also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors and other interested parties in analyzing our financial performance because it provides a comparable overview of our operations across historical periods. In addition, we believe that providing Adjusted EBITDA, together with a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, helps investors make comparisons between our company and other companies that may have different capital structures, different tax rates, different operational and ownership histories, and/or different forms of employee compensation.
Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management team as an additional measure of our performance for purposes of business decision-making, including managing expenditures. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA help our management identify additional trends in our financial results that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of net income or income from operations. Our Management recognizes that Adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations because of the excluded items, and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other companies.
We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude interest (income) expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and amortization of intangible assets, which represent intangible assets resulting from pushdown accounting, legal and professional services fees related to the Acquisition and corresponding antitrust litigation, including compliance with the hold separate arrangements imposed by the European Commission and our divestment from Illumina, restructuring charges, and stock-based compensation. We believe that the items subject to these further adjustments are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their nature, especially considering the impact of certain items as a result of the Acquisition.
Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for, operating income or loss from operations, net earnings or loss and other U.S. GAAP measures of income (loss). Additionally, it is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest and tax payments. Further, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
From inception through the closing date of Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL, we had funded our operations primarily through the sale and issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and receipt of continuation payments from Illumina. Post- Acquisition until completion of the Spin-Off, we received funding on a quarterly basis directly from Illumina. On June 21, 2024, in connection with the Spin-Off, we received a cash contribution of $932.3 million from Illumina.
 As of 
December 31, 2024
, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 
$214.2 million and our short-term marketable securities totaled $549.2 million
.
Future Funding Requirements
We began generating revenue in mid-2021, but we have continued to incur significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. Subsequent to the Acquisition, we have incurred net losses of 
$(9.8) billion
 which includes cumulative charges for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of 
$(6.8) billion
 as well as 
$(461.1) million
 of cumulative intangible asset amortization expense as a result of pushdown accounting. We expect to incur additional losses as we conduct our research and development efforts and seek to achieve broad reimbursement of our current commercialized products. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we anticipate that we will need to raise additional financing in the future to fund our operations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and extent of spending to support commercialization, market acceptance of our products prior to broad reimbursement, the timing of broad reimbursement, and launch of pipeline products. We are subject to typical risks associated with an early-stage commercial company and are developing the market for multi-cancer early detection. We may encounter complications with executing our business plans that may cause unforeseen expenses and adversely affect our business.
We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional capital through equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations, and the existence of securities with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations. We are also restricted in our ability to raise money through certain transactions or with certain parties pursuant to the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement we entered into with Illumina on June 24, 2024 in connection with the Spin-Off. We may also choose to raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, in which case we may relinquish significant rights or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Material Cash Requirements
Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024:
Leases
Historically, we have entered into operating leases for facilities and equipment used for research and development. Operating leases have remaining lease terms which range from 1 year to 9 years, and often include one or more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term from 5 to 15 years and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. The exercise of lease renewal and termination options are at the sole discretion of GRAIL. We also have variable lease payments that are primarily comprised of common area maintenance and utility charges. As of December 31, 2024, we had undiscounted operating lease payment obligations of 
$86.0 million
, with 
$15.2 million
 payable within twelve months of December 31, 2024.
Purchase Commitments
Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude purchase orders for goods and services that are cancellable. Our non-cancelable purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The Company’s contractual commitment amounts are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase commitments primarily relate to contractual commitments for future use of web services, laboratory supplies and marketing events in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2024, we had non-cancelable purchase obligations of 
$60.3 million
, with 
$21.1 million
 payable within twelve months of December 31, 2024.
Minimum Royalties
Minimum royalty payments are associated with licensing agreements related to research efforts. Minimum annual royalty payments do not include royalties that would be payable on net sales of Galleri or any future products, pursuant to existing agreements and licenses with Illumina, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and other third parties in excess of minimum annual royalty payments. As of December 31, 2024, we had minimum royalties of 
$6.8 million
, with 
$1.0 million 
payable within twelve months of December 31, 2024.
Critical Accounting Estimates
This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these audited Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.

Revenue
Our revenue is derived from screening and development services. Screening revenue includes cancer screening testing services provided to patients. Patients obtain tests via their employers, healthcare systems, payors, concierge medicine practices, or life insurance providers, or they can order the test via telemedicine (collectively referred to as our direct customers).
Screening Revenue
We recognize screening revenue from the sale of cancer screening testing services for patients. The test price is based on the negotiated contractual rate with our direct customers, otherwise our standard list price applies. For each specimen received, testing services are performed and test results are electronically delivered to the ordering physician. We identify each sale of our test to a customer as a single performance obligation; therefore, revenue is recognized at the point of time when the test result report is delivered.
For self-pay patients, we have concluded that an implied contract exists, however the transaction price for the implied contract represents variable consideration as there are situations in which we do not expect to collect the full invoiced amounts from self-pay patients due to price concessions. We utilize the expected value approach to estimate the transaction price and apply a constraint for such variable consideration, on a portfolio basis. We monitor the estimated amounts to be collected at each reporting period and assess whether a revision to the estimate is required based on the actual cash collections. Both the estimate and any subsequent revisions are subject to uncertainty and require significant judgment in the estimation and application of the constraint for such variable consideration. We analyze our actual cash collections over the expected collection period and compare it with the estimated variable consideration for each portfolio. The difference is then recognized as an adjustment to revenue when we do not believe there is a probable revenue reversal.
Development Services Revenue
We have developed a breakthrough methylation-based technology which is utilized by biopharmaceutical companies in research and clinical studies, and companion diagnostic development. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine standalone selling price by considering the historical selling price of these performance obligations in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, the price that customers in the market would be willing to pay, competitive pricing of other vendors, industry publications and current pricing practices, and expected costs of satisfying each performance obligation plus appropriate margin; or by using the residual approach if standalone selling price is not observable, by reference to the total transaction price less the sum of the observable standalone selling prices of other performance obligations promised in the contract.
Biopharmaceutical partners engage with us to run pilot and research studies by sending patient samples and comparing our test result to their expected result for evaluation of performance and application. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are completed.
Following favorable results from pilot and research studies, biopharmaceutical partners may enter into development service agreements with us related to clinical study and companion diagnostic device development and regulatory submissions for the developed product(s). These agreements typically have multiple commitments of services and therefore, have longer performance periods. We use an input method based on costs incurred to measure our progress toward the completion and satisfaction of the performance obligations. We assess the changes to the total expected cost estimates as well as any incremental fees negotiated resulting from changes to the scope of the original contract in determining the revenue recognized at each reporting period.
Accrued Clinical Studies and Research and Development Expenses
We accrue for estimated costs of research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers, including those conducting clinical studies. We record the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided and include these costs in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expenses in our consolidated 
123

Contents
statements of operations. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. We accrue for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with our third-party service providers. We make judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities balance in each reporting period.
Stock-Based Compensation
Prior to the Spin-Off, we compensated our employees through a long-term incentive program that included GRAIL cash-based equity incentive awards (“Cash-Based Equity Awards”). As these awards were indexed to the value of GRAIL and settled in cash, they were accounted for under ASC 718 
Compensation
 - 
Stock Compensation
 as a liability- classified award because the substantive terms of the award required cash settlement on each vesting date. Under ASC 718, we elected to expense the compensation cost over the life of the award via a straight-line method, recognized in stock-based compensation expense. This method resulted in the amount of compensation cost recognized as of any date being at least equal to the earned portion of the expected fair value of the awards on the vest date. Since we did not have actively traded standalone stock, GRAIL’s standalone value calculation was estimated by the Company based on its internal analysis and on input from our independent valuation advisors. To estimate the value of GRAIL, various assumptions were used, including assumptions related to our long-range financial projections, applicable discount rate and terminal growth rate. While we believe the assumptions used were reasonable, assumptions are inherently subject to uncertainty and, as previously noted, small variations in these assumptions could have had a significant impact on the concluded value.
The value of the Cash-Based Equity Awards was recorded over the respective vesting periods of the Cash-Based Equity Awards, with recognition of a corresponding liability recorded in incentive plan liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Cash-Based Equity Awards were remeasured at each reporting date until settlement, with changes in value recognized in stock-based compensation expense. On April 30, 2024, Illumina’s Compensation Committee approved an adjustment of the ordinary course payouts of the Cash-Based Equity Awards providing that the Cash-Based Equity Awards would be paid based on their nominal (face) value without adjustment based on changes in equity value. Subsequent to this adjustment to the Cash-Based Equity Awards and continuing until the Spin-Off, the Cash-Based Equity Awards expensed based on such nominal (face) value in accordance with their applicable vesting schedules.
In connection with the Spin-Off, pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, our Cash-Based Equity Awards were modified (the “Award Modification”). Our cash settled, liability-classified awards were modified into RSUs that will be settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting. The unvested performance stock options held by certain GRAIL employees to purchase Illumina stock were converted to options to purchase our common stock. See 
Note 7 — Stock-Based Compensation
 for further details of the Award Modification. 
The grant date fair value of RSUs and deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are determined based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of the grant, but (i) in the case of RSUs resulting from the Award Modification, were based on the closing market price of GRAIL’s common stock on the date of the Award Modification, and (ii) in the case of DSUs resulting from deferrals of director cash fees, are determined based on the closing market price of GRAIL’s common stock on the date on which such fees would have been otherwise paid). Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the RSUs and DSUs.
The fair value of performance stock options with service conditions is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The model assumptions include expected volatility, term, dividends, and the risk-free interest rate. The expected volatility is generally determined by weighing the historical and implied volatility of peer companies’ common stock. The expected term is our best estimates based on the vesting period and contractual term. Given that cash dividends were never declared or paid on the Illumina nor our common stock, the expected dividend yield is determined to be 0%. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The risk-free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the stock-based awards. The fair value of the performance stock options begins to be recognized when it is probable that the performance-based condition will be met.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment
Goodwill represents the costs in excess of the fair value of net assets of GRAIL acquired by Illumina in August 2021. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of GRAIL’s in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) and were measured by Illumina at fair value as of the Closing Date.
We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired when the carrying value of a reporting unit or asset exceeds its fair value. GRAIL currently has only one reporting unit; and therefore, we measure the carrying value against the fair value of the Company.
In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting entity is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is more likely than not for a reporting unit’s fair value to be greater than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is not performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not for a reporting unit’s fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is performed and compared to the carrying value of that reporting unit. In certain instances, we may elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill of that reporting unit is impaired and an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair value.
Generally, we measure the fair value of the reporting unit based on a present value of future discounted cash flows. The discounted cash flow models indicate the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that the reporting units are expected to generate in the future. Significant estimates in the discounted cash flow models include the weighted average cost of capital, revenue growth rates, long-term rate of growth, and profitability of our business.
Discount rates were determined using a weighted average cost of capital for risk factors specific to us and other market and industry data. In the most recent analysis, a discount rate of 51.5% was used for the goodwill assessment and 46.5% and 20% was used for the intangible assets assessments. The estimates and assumptions used in our assessment represent a Level 3 measurement because they are supported by little or no market activity and reflect our own assumptions in measuring fair value. Specifically for the recent goodwill impairment analysis, valuation estimates from financial advisors derived from revenue multiples from peer public companies was used. For the recent indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis, discount rate estimates derived from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) Accounting and Valuation Guide were used. The assumptions used are inherently subject to uncertainty and we note that small changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the concluded value.
Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes. Changes in tax laws, regulations, or statutory tax rates (including the implementation of global minimum tax rates in certain jurisdictions), and estimates of our future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes. 
Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved. In evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. 
We recognize the impact of a tax position in our consolidated financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payments that 
125

Contents
are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability. These differences, as well as any interest and penalties, will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined.
JOBS Act
We are an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As an emerging growth company, we may delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have nonetheless irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of the following: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues first meet or exceed at least $1.235 billion (as adjusted for inflation), (ii) the date on which we have, during the prior three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we (a) have an aggregate worldwide market value of common stock held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more (measured at the end of each fiscal year) as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter and (b) have been a reporting company under the Exchange Act for at least one year (and have filed at least one annual report under the Exchange Act), or (iv) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Sensitivity
We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates related primarily to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We had cash and cash equivalents of 
$214.2 million
 as of December 31, 2024, which consisted primarily of bank deposits, money market funds, and marketable securities. 
Our marketable securities are held in U.S. government treasury bills. As of 
December 31, 2024
, we had short-term marketable securities of $549.2 million. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the United States. 
The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital to fund our operations. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.
Our investments are subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low-risk profile of our investments, a hypothetical 10% relative change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Foreign Currency Sensitivity
The majority of our transactions occur in U.S. dollars. However, we do have certain transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound, and we therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk. The fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against the foreign currencies affects the reported amounts of expenses, assets, and liabilities associated with certain activities. We do not currently engage in any hedging activity to reduce our potential exposure to currency fluctuations, although we may choose to do so in the future. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of GRAIL, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis

for

Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

STATEMENTS
NOTE 1.

ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
GRAIL, Inc. (“GRAIL” or the “Company”),

headquartered

in Menlo Park, Californi
a
, is an innovative

commercial-stage

healthcare

company focused

on saving

lives

and

shifting

the

paradigm

of

early

cancer

detection.

The Company’s Galleri

blood

test is a commercially available screening test for early detection of multiple types of cancer. GRAIL’s common stock is listed under the ticker symbol “GRAL” on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
GRAIL was previously acquired by Illumina, Inc. (”Illumina”) in August 2021, at which point it became a 
100
% owned subsidiary of Illumina, and held separate as a part of binding hold separate commitments implemented pursuant to orders issued by the European Commission. See

Note 10 — Legal And Regulatory Proceedings

for additional

details. GRAIL separated from Illumina on June 24, 2024, as described below. GRAIL was a limited

liability

company

(“LLC”) from August 19, 2021 to June 21, 2024 when it was converted into a corporation (the “Conversion”) in anticipation of such separation.
Separation from Illumina
On June 24, 2024, (the “Distribution Date”), Illumina completed the previously announced spin-off of GRAIL (the “Spin-Off”). The Spin-Off was completed through a distribution of 
85.5
% of the Company’s outstanding common stock to the holders of record of Illumina’s common stock as of the close of business on June 13, 2024 (the “Distribution”), which resulted in the distribution of 
31.0
 million shares of common stock. As a result of the Distribution, the Company became an independent public entity. Illumina’s ownership of GRAIL reduced to 
14.5
% after the Spin-Off. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the Company or GRAIL, refer to (i) GRAIL, LLC prior to the Conversion and (ii) GRAIL, Inc. and its subsidiaries following the Conversion.
In connection with the Spin-Off, the Company entered into or adopted agreements that provide a framework for the relationship between the Company and Illumina, including, but not limited to the following:
•
Separation and Distribution Agreement — governed the terms and conditions of the Spin-Off and sets forth aspects of the Company’s and Illumina’s relationship following the Spin-Off. See 
Note 10 — Legal And Regulatory Proceedings
 for more information regarding the contingencies related to this agreement.
•
Tax Matters Agreement — governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Illumina and the Company after the Spin-Off with respect to all tax matters and includes restrictions to preserve the tax-free status of the Distribution. See 
Note 13 — Taxes
 for more information regarding income taxes and 
Note 10 — Legal And Regulatory Proceedings
 regarding the contingencies related to this agreement.
•
Employee Matters Agreement — addresses employment, compensation, and benefits matters, including the allocation and treatment of assets and liabilities relating to employees and compensation and benefits plans and programs in which GRAIL employees participate, as well as the treatment of cash-based incentive awards in connection with the Spin-Off. See 
Note 7 — Stock-Based Compensation
 for further details regarding treatment of equity awards.
•
Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement — governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Illumina and the Company after the Spin-Off with respect to Illumina’s continuing ownership of GRAIL common stock.
•
Supply and Commercialization Agreement Amendment — amends the Company’s supply and commercialization agreement with Illumina, which governs the ongoing supply and commercial relationship, including licensing, royalty payments and intellectual property between GRAIL and Illumina. See 
Note 15 — Related Party Transactions
 for more information regarding the royalty arrangements with Illumina.

FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS
Illumina provided the Company with disposal funding (the “Disposal Funding”) in the amount of $
932.3
 million in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, subject to a clawback feature in the event that the Company (i) consummates a change in control transaction, sells or licenses substantially all of its assets or adopts a plan of liquidation (collectively, a “GRAIL Change of Control”), or (ii) (1) pays any dividend on, or makes any other distribution in respect of, any shares of its capital stock or other equity or voting interests (other than a stock dividend or a stock split), or otherwise consummates a return of capital from the Company to any of its equity holders or (2) redeems, purchases or otherwise acquires any of its outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interests (other than the acquisition of any shares in order to effectuate a “net settlement” transaction for the purposes of satisfying tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the grant, vesting, exercise and/or settlement of any outstanding incentive equity awards of GRAIL held by its current or former employees), in each case, prior to September 24, 2025 (the 
15
-month anniversary of the Distribution Date). If the Company consummates a transaction described in the foregoing clause (i), the Company must return to Illumina a cash amount decreasing over time calculated by reference to the number of months which have elapsed since the Distribution Date at the time of the public announcement of the event giving rise to the change of control. If the Company consummates a transaction described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Company must return to Illumina a cash amount equal to the payments made by the Company in connection with such transaction. The amount of clawback payments made cannot exceed the amount of the initial disposal funding. See 
Note 10 — Legal And Regulatory Proceedings — Contingencies
 for details.
Our Ability

to Continue as a Going Concern
The accompanying

in

the

normal

course

of

business.

The realization

of

assets

and

the

satisfaction

of

in

the

normal

of

business

are

dependent

on,

among other

things,

the

Company’s

ability

to

manage

its net

loss

and

to

become

profitable

and

operate

profitably,

to manage

the Company’s

negative

and

to

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis

of Presentation

and Principles

of Consolidation
The accompanying

consolidated

financial

statements

represent

the

historical

operations

of the

standalone GRAIL

legal

entity

and

include

purchase

accounting

adjustments

and

certain

tax adjustments

as

if
 the Company

filed

a

separate

income

tax

return

and

was

not

included

in

Illumina’s

consolidated return for the period of 
time the Company was owned by Illumina
.

All

revenues

and

costs

as

well

as

assets

and

liabilities

directly

associated

with

the

business

activity

of

the Company

are

included

in

the

consolidated

financial

statements.

Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL in August 2021 (“the Acquisition”) represented a change of control with respect to GRAIL. Given GRAIL, Inc. merged with SDG Ops, Inc., which then merged with SDG Ops LLC, authoritative guidance (ASC 805-50-30) required pushdown accounting to be applied for the Second Merger amongst entities under common control. As a result of the application of pushdown accounting, the separately

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS
issued financial statements of GRAIL reflect Illumina’s basis in the assets and liabilities of GRAIL which were remeasured to fair value as of the 
closing date of Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL (“
Closing Date”). Intangible assets included developed technology, in-process research and development, and trade names, as well as goodwill. There were also various other purchase price adjustment entries made in connection with the Acquisition that impacted the GRAIL standalone financial statements.
Management

considered

the

need

to

allocate

any

shared

costs

incurred

by

the

parent,

Illumina,

to

the accompanying

consolidated

financial

statements.

As previously

discussed,

the

European

Commission

had adopted an order requiring

Illumina

and GRAIL

to be held and operated

as distinct

and separate

entities.

As no integration
 ever

occurred,

management

concluded

that

no

material

allocations

are

required.

However, amounts

recognized by the

Company

are

not

necessarily representative

of

the

amounts

that

would

have

been

reflected

in

the

financial

statements

had

the

Company operated

independently

of

the

parent.

Related

party

transactions

with

Illumina

are

discussed

further

in 
Note 15 — Related Party Transactions.
These

consolidated

financial

statements

are

prepared

in

accordance

with

United

States

Generally

Accepted Accounting Principles

(“U.S. GAAP”) and include the accounts

of the Company

and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

All intercompany

balances

have been eliminated

in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation

of the consolidated

financial

statements

in accordance

with U.S. GAAP

requires management

to make

estimates

and assumptions

that

affect

the

amounts

of assets

and liabilities,

disclosure

of contingent

assets

and liabilities,

and the reported

amounts

of revenues

and expenses in the consolidated

financial statements

and accompanying

notes.

The Company bases

its

estimates

on historical

experience

and other

market- specific

or

other

relevant

assumptions

that

it

believes

to

be

reasonable

under

the

circumstances.

On an

ongoing basis,

management

evaluates

its

estimates,

including,

but

not

limited

to,

those

related

to

estimation

of

variable consideration,

estimation

of

credit

losses,

standalone

selling

price

included

in

contracts

with

multiple performance

obligations,

measure

of

progress

toward

the

completion

and

satisfaction

of

performance

obligations, accrued

clinical

studies

and research

expenses,

stock-based

compensation

expense, measurement

of

liability-classified

awards,

valuation

of

goodwill

and

intangible

assets,

useful

lives

of

intangible assets

and

property

and

equipment,

determination

of

incremental

borrowing

rate

for

operating

leases, contingencies,

and

the

provision

for

income

taxes, among

others.

These

estimates

generally

involve

complex issues

and

require

judgments,

involve

the

analysis

of

historical

results

and

prediction

of

future

trends,

can

require extended

periods

of

time

to

resolve

and

are

subject

to

change

from

period

to

period.

Actual

results

could

differ from

those

estimates,

and such differences

could

be material

to the

consolidated

financial

statements.
Concentration

of Credit

Risk
Financial Instruments
The Company is subject to credit risk from its portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable sec
urities held at 
three
 accredited financial institutions. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 
$
214.2
 million 
of cash deposits and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities of 
$
549.2
 million
. 
The Company limits its exposure to credit losses by investing in money market funds and U.S government treasury securities through U.S. banks with high credit ratings. The Company’s cash consi
sts of deposits held with banks that may at times exceed federally insured limits, however, its exposure to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institution is limited to the extent of amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company performs evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions to limit the amount of credit exposure. The Company has 
not
 experienced any losses in such accounts. 
The Company has policy limits for the amount it can invest in any one type of security, except for securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government. The goals of the Company’s investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: minimize risk of the invested capital (including credit risk, interest rate risk and concentration risk), provide liquidity in a timely manner to accommodate operational and capital needs, and subject to the foregoing, seek to generate a reasonable return based on market conditions and given these risk and liquidity guidelines.

As 
F-10

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS
of December 31, 2024, the Company had no off-balance sheet

concentrations

of

credit

risk. Under its investment policy, the Company limits amounts invested in such securities by credit rating, maturity, investment type and issuer, as a result, the Company is not exposed to any significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments.
Customers
The

Company

is

subject

to

credit

risk

related

to

its

accounts

Accounts

primarily

arise from

Significant customers are those that represent more than ten percent of total revenue or accounts receivable, net balances for the periods and as of each consolidated balance sheet date presented, respectively. Revenue from a major customer that accounted for 10% or more of total revenue is as follows:

Suppliers
The Company is subject to a concentration risk for equipment, supplies and reagents that are available from a limited number of sources. We source certain laboratory equipment, supplies and reagents used to perform testing services and research and development from single vendors. Historically, we have not experienced significant issues sourcing equipment and supplies needed to perform testing services.
Significant

Accounting

Policies
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents

consist of cash on deposit with banks denominated

in U.S. Dollars and British Pounds, money market funds, and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.

agreements.
Short-term marketable securities
The Company classifies its investments as available-for-sale, which consist of high-grade United States (“U.S.”) government treasury bills and are reported at fair value. Management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. Marketable securities that mature within twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term marketable securities and those with maturities over twelve months from the balance sheet date are 
F-11
Table o

GRAIL,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS
classified as long-term marketable securities. Unrealized holding gains and losses are reflected as a separate component of shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) until realized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are recognized in net income or loss.
The amended guidance from ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of expected credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities held at the reporting date over the remaining life based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company regularly evaluates its investment portfolio under the available-for-sale debt securities impairment model guidance for indications of possible impairment from credit losses or other factors. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company evaluates whether a current expected credit loss exists based on available information relevant to the credit rating of the security, current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company’s investment portfolio is composed of low-risk, investment grade securities and thus the Company has not recorded an expected credit loss for its investment portfolio.
Fair

Value

of

Financial

Instruments
The

fair

value

of

financial

assets

and

liabilities

is

determined

using

the

fair

value

hierarchy

established

in Accounting Standards Codification

(“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement

(“ASC 820”). ASC

820 identifies

fair

value

as

the

exchange

price,

or

exit

price,

representing

the

amount

that

would

be

received

to

sell

an asset

or

paid

to

transfer

a

liability

in

an

orderly

transaction

between

market

participants.

The

hierarchy

describes three

levels

of

inputs

that

may

be

used

to

measure

fair

value,

as

follows:
Level

1

—Observable

inputs,

such

as

quoted

prices

in

active

markets

for

identical

assets

and

liabilities.
Level

2

—Observable

inputs

other

than

Level

1

that

are

observable,

either

directly

or

indirectly,

such

as quoted

prices

for

similar

assets

or

liabilities,

quoted

prices

in

markets

that

are

not

active,

or

other

inputs

that

are observable

or

can

be

corroborated

by

observable

market

data

for

substantially

the

full

term

of

the

assets

or liabilities.
Level

3

—Unobservable

inputs

that

are

supported

by

little

or

no

market

activity

and

that

are

significant

to the

fair

value

of

the

assets

or

liabilities.
A

financial

instrument’s

level

within

the

fair

value

hierarchy

is

based

on

the

lowest

level

of

any

input

that

is significant

to the

Accounts

receivable are

evaluated

regularly

for

collectability

and

potential

losses.

Allowance

for

credit

losses

is

estimated based

on management’s

assessment

of historical

collection

trends

and the

financial

conditions

of customer
s
, among other factors. These reserves are re-evaluated on a regular basis and adjusted, as needed. Once a receivable is deemed to be uncollectible, the receivable balance is charged against the reserve.

As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had $
3.8
 million and $
3.1
 million of allowance for credit losses, respectively.

Lease Term
Leases
Leases

are

classified

as operating

or financing

at

lease

inception

and as necessary

at

modification.

Leased assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities

represent its

obligation

to

make

lease

payments

arising

from

the

lease.
Operating

leases

are

included

in

operating

lease

right-of-use

(“ROU”) assets

and operating

lease

liabilities in

the

consolidated

balance

sheets.

Operating

lease

ROU

assets

and

liabilities

are

recognized

at

the

lease commencement

date

based

on

the

present

value

of

lease

payments

over

the

lease

term.

When

readily determinable,

the

Company

uses

the

rate

implicit

in

the

lease

to

discount

lease

payments;

however,

when

the

rate is

not

readily

determinable,

the

Company

uses

the

incremental

borrowing

rate

based

on

the

information

available at

the

commencement

date.

The

incremental

borrowing

rate

is

the

rate

of

interest

that

a

company

would

have

to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments

on a collateralized

basis over a similar

term

and in a similar economic

environment. The operating

lease

ROU

asset

also

includes

any

initial

direct

costs,

lease

payments

made

prior

to

lease commencement,

and

lease

incentives

received.

Variable

lease

payments

are

expensed

as

incurred

and

are

not included

within

the

ROU

asset

and

lease

liability

calculation.

Variable

lease

payments

primarily

include reimbursements

of

costs

incurred

by

lessors

for

common

area

maintenance

and

utilities.
For

each

lease,

the

determined

lease

term

is

based

on

a

noncancellable

period,

including

any

rent-free periods

provided

by

the

lessor,

and

may

include

options

to

extend

or

terminate

the

lease

when

it

is

reasonably certain

that

the

Company

will

exercise

that

option.

Lease

cost

for

lease

payments

is

recognized

on

a

straight-line basis

over

the

lease

term.

Certain

lease

agreements

contain

lease

and

non-lease

components.

The Company accounts

for

non-lease

components

as

part

of

the

lease

component

to

which

they

relate.
The

Company

does

not

recognize

ROU

assets

and

lease

liabilities

for

short-term

leases,

which

have

a

lease term of twelve months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably

certain

to exercise.
Goodwill and Intangible

Assets
Intangible

assets

identified

in

the

Acquisition

include

GRAIL

trade

names,

developed

technology,

and GRAIL

in-process

research

and

development

(“IPR&D”)

and

were

measured

at

fair

value

as

of

the

closing date of Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL (“
Closing

represents

the

excess

of

cost

over

fair

value

of

the

The

Company’s

trade

names,

GRAIL

,

have

brand

recognition

in

the

market

related

to

the services

GRAIL

provides

customers

and the research

and development

activities

GRAIL

performs.

GRAIL’s developed

technology

includes

intangible

assets

related

to

Galler
i
, its

multi-cancer

early

detection

test

that

was launched

as

a

laborator
y
-developed

test

(“LDT”)

in

2021,

as

well

as

a

diagnostic

aid

for

cancer

(“DAC”)

test. The developed

technology

underpins

both

Galler
i
, designed

as

a cancer

screening

test

for

asymptomatic individuals over 50 years of age, and DAC that is being designed to accelerate diagnostic resolution for patients for whom there is a clinical suspicion of cancer. The cost of identifiable intangible assets with finite lives, such as trade names and developed technology assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets’ respective estimated useful lives of 
9
 years and 
18
 years,

respectively.
The Company’s IPR&D includes

assets related

to GRAIL’s development

of a minimal

residual

disease (“MRD”)

test,

a

post-diagnostic

test,

that

is

currently

under

development.

IPR&D

is

considered

indefinit
e
-lived and

therefore

is

not

amortized

until

completed

and

placed

into

service,

at

which

point

it

will

begin

to

be amortized

over

its

estimated

useful

life

or

expensed

upon

abandonment

of

the

associated

research

and development

efforts.
While goodwill and IPR&D are not amortize
d
, they are reviewed for impairment

at least annually or more frequently

if events or circumstances

indicate a potential

for impairment.

Goodwill and IPR&D are considered impaired

if

the

carrying

value

of

the

reporting

unit

or

IPR&D

asset

exceeds

its

respective

fair

value.
The Company 
performs
 its

goodwill

impairment

analysis

at

the

reporting

unit

level.
 The Company 
has

one

reporting

unit,

which aligns

with
 its 
reporting

structure

and

availability

of

discrete

financial

information.

During

the

goodwill impairment

review,
 the Company 
assesses

qualitative

factors

to

determine

whether

it

is

more

likely

than

not

that

the

fair

value of
 the Company’s 
reporting

unit

is

less

than

the

carrying

amount,

including

goodwill. During the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment review, the Company assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value is less than the carrying amount. 
The qualitative factors considered include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and our overall financial performance. 
If
 the Company 
determines

that

it

is

not

more likely

than

not

that

the

fair

value

of

our

reporting

unit or the intangible asset

is

less

than

the

carrying

amount,

no

additional

assessment is

necessary.

If

the

carrying

amount

of

the

reporting

unit
 or intangible asset 
exceeds

its

fair

value,
 the Company 
records

an

impairment

loss based

on

the

excess.
 The Company 
may

elect

to

bypass

the

qualitative

assessment

in

a

period

and

proceed

to

perform

the quantitative

goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset

impairment

test.
Impairment

of

Long-Lived

Assets
Long-lived

assets,

other

than

goodwill

and

IPR&D

(as

described

above),

are

evaluated

for

indications

of possible

impairment

whenever

events

or

changes

in

circumstances

indicate

that

the

carrying

amount

of

an

asset may

not

be

recoverable.

Recoverability

is

measured

by

comparison

of

the

carrying

amounts

to

the

future undiscounted

cash

flows

attributable

to

these

assets.

Should

impairment

exist,

the

impairment

would

be

measured as

the

amount

by

which

the

carrying

amount

of

the

assets

exceeds

the

fair

value

of

those

assets.

For self-pay

patients,

the

Company

has concluded

that

an implied

contract

exists,

however the

transaction price

for

the

implied

contract

represents

variable

consideration

as there

are

situations

in which the

Company is not

expected

to

collect

the

full

invoiced

amounts

from

self-pay

patients

due to

price

concessions.

The Company utilizes

the

expected

value

approach

to

estimate

the

transaction

price

and

applies

a

constraint

for

such

variable consideration,

on a portfolio

basis. The Company monitors

the estimated

amounts

to be collected

at each reporting

period

based

on

actual

cash

collections

in

order

to

assess

whether

a

revision

to

the

estimate

is

required. Both the estimate

and any subsequent

revision

contain uncertainty

and require

the use of significant

judgment

in the

estimation

of

the

variable

consideration

and

application

of

the

constraint

for

such

variable

consideration.

The Company

analyzes

its

actual

cash

collections

over

the

expected

collection

period

and

compares

it

with

the estimated

variable

consideration

for

each

portfolio

and any difference

is

recognized

as an adjustment

to estimated revenue

after

the

expected

collection

period,

subject

to

assessment

of

the

risk

of

future

revenue

reversal.
Development

Services

Revenue
Development

services

revenue

includes

development

activities

performed

in partnership

with biopharmaceutical

companies.

The Company’s

targeted

methylation-based

technology

enables

development

of products

and

services

to

optimize

treatment

once

a

cancer

has

been

diagnosed.

Biopharmaceutical

partners engage

the

Company

to

run

pilots

and

research

studies

to

evaluate

and

learn

about

the

technology’s

application. The Company evaluates

the

terms

and conditions

included

within

its

development

services

contracts

with biopharmaceutical

customers

to ensure

appropriate

revenue

recognition,

including

whether

services

are considered

distinct

performance

obligations.

The Company first

identifies

material

promises

under

the

contract and

then

evaluates

whether

these

promises

are

capable

of

being

distinct

within

the

context

of

the

contract.

In assessing

whether

a

promised

service

is

capable

of

being

distinct,

the

Company

considers

whether

the

customer could

benefit

from

the

service

either

on its

own or together

with other

resources

that

are

readily

available

to the customer,

including

factors

such as the

research,

development,

and commercialization

capabilities

of a third

party as

well

as

the

availability

of

the

associated

expertise

in

the

general

marketplace.

For

contracts

with

multiple performance

obligations,

the

transaction

price

is

allocated

to

the

separate

performance

obligations

on

a

relative standalone

selling

price

basis.

The Company determines

the

standalone

selling

price

by considering

the

historical selling

price

of

these

performance

obligations

in

similar

transactions

as

well

as

other

factors,

including,

but

not limited

to,

the

price

that

customers

in

the

market

would

be

willing

to

pay,

competitive

pricing

of

other

vendors, industry

publications

and current

pricing

practices,

and expected

costs

of satisfying

each

performance

obligation plus

appropriate

margin;

or

by

using

the

residual

approach

if

standalone

selling

price

is

not

observable,

by reference

to

the

total

transaction

price

less

the

sum

of

the

observable

standalone

selling

prices

of

other performance

obligations

promised

in the

contract.
Biopharmaceutical

partners

engage

the

Company

to

run

pilot

and

research

studies

by

sending

patient samples

and comparing

the

Company’s

test

result

to their

expected

result

for

evaluation

of performance

and application.

The Company recognizes

revenue

as performance

obligations

are

completed.
Following

favorable

results

from

pilot

and research

studies,

biopharmaceutical

partners

and the

Company may

enter

into

development

service

agreements

related

to clinical

trial

and companion

diagnostic

device development

and regulatory

submissions

for

the

developed

product(s).

These agreements

typically

have multiple commitments

of services

and therefore

have longer performance

periods. The Company uses an input method based

on

costs

incurred

to

measure

its

progress

toward

the

completion

and

satisfaction

of

the

performance

Revenue
Deferred

revenue,

contracts

with customers.

For example,

prepayments

received

from

patients

for screening

testing

services

contracts

with biopharmaceutical

customers

often contain

upfront

payments

revenue

to

the

extent

is

received

prior

to the

are

relieved

as the

Company performs

its

obligations

under

the

is

recognized.

Deferred

revenue was $
1.6
 million and $
0.8

Stock-Based

Compensation

Expense
The Company’s stock-based compensation expense includes expenses related to Cash-Based Equity Awards, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), deferred stock units (“DSUs”), and performance stock options. Forfeitures are accounted for as incurred, as a reversal of stock-based compensation expense related to awards that will not vest.
A cash-based equity incentive award (the “Cash-Based Equity Award”) program was adopted following Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL in 2021 to provide GRAIL employees with dollar-denominated long-term incentive awards that were indexed to the value of GRAIL. In connection with the Spin-Off, in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement, the Cash-Based Equity Awards, which were cash-settled, liability-classified awards, were modified to become RSUs that will be settled in shares of the Company’s common stock upon vesting (the “Award Modification”). Unvested performance stock options that were previously held by certain GRAIL employees to purchase Illumina common stock were converted to options to purchase GRAIL common stock in connection with the Spin-Off. See Note 7 — Stock-Based Compensation for further details of the Award Modification. 
Prior to the Award Modification, the Cash-Based Equity Awards were liability-classified awards because the Cash-Based Equity Awards could be (and were) settled in cash. Until April 30, 2024, GRAIL’s stand-alone value calculation was estimated by the Company based on its analysis and the input from independent valuation advisors. The value of the Cash-Based Equity Awards was recorded over the applicable vesting periods, with recognition of a corresponding liability recorded in incentive plan liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Cash-Based Equity Awards were remeasured at each reporting date until settlement with changes in fair value recognized in stock-based compensation expense. On April 30, 2024, Illumina’s Compensation Committee approved an adjustment of the ordinary course payouts of the Cash-Based Equity Awards providing that the Cash-Based Equity Awards would be paid based on their nominal (face) value without adjustment based on changes in equity value. Subsequent to this adjustment to the Cash-Based Equity Awards and continuing until the Award Modification, the Cash-Based Equity Awards were expensed in accordance with their applicable vesting schedules.
In connection with the Acquisition, Illumina issued equity awards to GRAIL employees in exchange for their remaining outstanding and unvested GRAIL equity awards (the “Replacement Awards”). The awards consisted of restricted stock units and performance stock options that settled in shares of Illumina common stock at vesting or exercise, as applicable. The compensation expense for the Replacement Awards was recognized based on the fair value on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.
The grant date fair values of RSUs and DSUs are generally determined based on the closing market price of GRAIL’s common stock on the date of the grant, but (i) in the case of RSUs resulting from the Award Modification, the date of the Award Modification, and (ii) in the case of DSUs resulting from deferrals of director cash fees, based on the closing market price of GRAIL’s common stock on the date that such cash fees would have been otherwise paid. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the award on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the RSUs.
The fair value of performance stock options with service conditions is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The model assumptions include expected volatility, term, dividends, and the risk-free interest rate. The expected volatility is generally determined by weighting the historical and implied volatility of peer companies’ common stock. The expected term is the Company’s best estimates based on the vesting period and contractual term. Given that cash dividends were never declared or paid on the Illumina nor GRAIL common

stock, the expected dividend yield is determined to be

%. The Company does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The risk-free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the stock-based awards. The fair value of the performance stock options begins to be recognized when it is probable that the performance-based condition will be met.
Defined

Contribution

Plan
The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan under 
Section

401(k)
 of the Internal Revenue Code 
(the

“401(k)

Plan”)
 pursuant to which, eligible employees can elect to contribute eligible compensation to the 401(k) Plan, subject to certain limitations. On January 1, 2023, the 401K Plan was modified to provide for a 
100
% employer match of employee contributions up to a maximum of 
three thousand
 dollars per employee. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company contributed $
3.9
 million and $
3.9
 million to match employee contributions, respectively. The Company pays the administrative costs for the 401(k) plan.
Provision

for

(Benefit

from)

Income

Taxes
As a standalone entity, the Company files tax returns on its own behalf, and tax balances and the effective income tax rate may differ from the amounts reported in historical periods. As of June 24, 2024 and in connection with the Spin-Off, the Company adjusted its deferred tax balances and computed its related tax provision to reflect operations as a standalone entity. During the period that Illumina held the Company, the Company’s activity generated various tax attributes recognized as deferred tax assets (“DTAs”), due primarily to the generation of net operating losses (“NOLs”), IRC 174 capitalized research and experimental expenditures, and research and development (“R&D”) tax credits that could not be specifically utilized by the Company as it did not generate positive taxable income and it was not a separately regarded tax paying entity from Illumina. Since the Company was not a separately regarded taxable entity from Illumina, these tax attributes were either utilized by or will be utilized by Illumina when filing its consolidated tax return. Historically, the tax attributes were only presented in the Company’s standalone financial statements to allow the users to understand the financial position of the Company as a standalone taxable entity under the Separate-Return Method.
 The total tax-effected value of the tax attributes, net of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN48”) liabilities and valuation allowance that were deemed to be the property of Illumina, was $
447.2
 million. In connection with the Spin-off, the underlying $
447.2
 million of tax attributes were adjusted through an entry of 
$
447.2
 million
 to additional paid in capital.
Net Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
The Company calculates basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed based on the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. In loss periods, basic and diluted net loss per share are identical since the effect of potentially dilutive common shares is antidilutive and therefore excluded. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of shares issuable under equity awards. Potentially dilutive common shares from equity awards are determined using the average share price for each period under the treasury stock method. In addition, proceeds from exercise of equity awards and the average amount of unrecognized compensation expense for equity awards are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
Restructuring Charges 
Restructuring charges consist primarily of severance, benefits, payroll taxes, and other related costs. The Company evaluates the nature of these costs to determine if they relate to ongoing benefit arrangements which are accounted for under ASC 712, Compensation - Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits, or one-time benefit arrangements which are accounted for under ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. The Company records a liability for ongoing employee termination benefits when it is probable that an employee is entitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated. One-time employee termination costs are recognized

when management has communicated the termination plan to employees, unless future service is required, in which case the costs are recognized ratably over the future service period.

2024 Goodwill Impairment
In Q2 2024, prior to the Spin-Off, the approval of the Spin-Off by Illumina’s board of directors represented a potential indicator of impairment, which also aligned with the timing of Illumina’s annual goodwill impairment test date for 2024. The

2022 Goodwill Impairment
On July 13, 2022, the European General Court ruled that the European Commission had jurisdiction under the European Union Merger Regulation to review the Acquisition. Additionally, on September 6, 2022, the European Commission issued a decision prohibiting the Acquisition. These decisions constituted substantive changes in circumstances and led Illumina to test goodwill for impairment. The assessment was performed using a combination of both an income and a market approach to determine the fair value of goodwill. The income approach utilized the estimated discounted cash flows, while the market approach utilized comparable company information. Estimates and assumptions used in the income approach included projected cash flows and a discount rate. The discount rate selected at the time of the goodwill impairment assessment was 
22.0

In conjunction

the IPR&D intangible

asset of the GRAIL reporting unit was evaluated for

potential

impairment by Illumina prior to the Spin-Off.

The evaluation

for

a potential

impairment

of the

IPR&D intangible

asset

was performed by comparing

its carrying

value to the assessed

estimated

fair

value, which was determined

by the income approach,

using

model.

Estimates

and

The

discount

rate

selected

at

assessment

was

on

the

impairment

test

performed,

Illumina

assessed

and

determined

of GRAIL’s IPR&D intangible

asset

exceeded

its

estimated

fair

value. As a result of push down accounting, the Company recognized

an 
impairment

of $
420.0
 million primarily due to changes to revenue projections and the discount rate utilized.
Subsequent to the Spin-Off, the Company performed a portfolio review and determined to decrease investment in the development of the IPR&D asset, which impacted the amount and timing of expected future cash flows attributable to IPR&D. This determination was driven by the impact of our post-Spin-Off capital

structure, constitution of our Board at the time of the Spin-Off as the key decision maker for the determination, and increased ability to revisit our business strategy and portfolio as a standalone public company without regulatory oversight. This represented a potential impairment indicator. An impairment assessment was performed using a discounted cash flow model utilizing the updated projected cash flows and discount rate. The discount rate selected was 
20
%. Based

on

the

impairment

test

performed,

the

Company

assessed

and

determined

that

exceeded

its

estimated

value. As a result,

the Company recognized

an additional impairment

of $
112.0
 million,

primarily

due to a decrease

in projected

cash flows. 
In conjunction with the Q3 2023 goodwill impairment assessment described above, the Company also evaluated the IPR&D intangible asset for potential impairment. The evaluation for a potential impairment of the IPR&D intangible asset was performed by comparing its carrying value to the assessed estimated fair value, which was determined by the income approach, using a discounted cash flow model. Estimates and assumptions used in the income approach included projected cash flows and a discount rate. The discount rate selected at the time of the IPR&D intangible impairment assessment was 
19.0
%. Based on the impairment test performed, the Company assessed and determined that the carrying value of the IPR&D intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment of $
110.0
 million, primarily due to a decrease in projected cash flows and a higher discount rate selected for the fair value calculation.

2024 Incentive Award Plan
The GRAIL, Inc. 2024 Incentive Award Plan (the “2024 Plan”) was adopted by GRAIL and approved by Illumina, in its capacity as GRAIL’s sole stockholder, in May 2024 to facilitate the grant of cash and equity incentive awards to non-employee directors, employees, and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries and to enhance the ability of the Company and any of its subsidiaries to obtain and retain the services of these individuals following the Spin-Off. This plan authorizes the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents, performance-based awards, and other stock or cash based awards. The restricted stock units granted to employees and directors consist of vesting periods ranging between 
18
 months and 
48
 months. The maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2024 Plan is the sum of (a) 
8,656,817

STATEMENTS
The GRAIL, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the “2024 Deferred Compensation Plan”) was adopted by GRAIL’s board of directors on July 15, 2024 to provide GRAIL’s non-employee directors with an opportunity to defer payment of all or a portion of their eligible compensation, consisting of cash fees and/or equity awards granted during a given year. Each director may make an irrevocable deferral election with respect to all or a portion of their eligible compensation in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 2024 Deferred Compensation Plan, deferring payment until the earlier of (i) a fixed date elected by the director (if any), (ii) the director’s separation from service, (iii) a “change in control” (as defined in the 2024 Plan) or (iv) the director’s death or permanent disability. If a director elects to defer all or a portion of their cash fees, GRAIL will issue a number of DSUs to the director equal to the portion cash fees deferred divided by the fair market value of a share of GRAIL’s common stock on the date that such fees would have otherwise been paid, rounded down to the nearest whole share. If a director elects to defer their equity awards, GRAIL will issue a number of deferred stock units to the director equal to the number of shares of GRAIL common stock underlying the deferred awards and subject to the same vesting, forfeiture and other restrictions that would have otherwise applied to such equity award absent the deferral. All DSUs will be issued under the 2024 Incentive Award Plan. As of 
December 31, 2024
, 
three
 of our directors had elected to defer their 2024 cash fees and 
two
 of our directors had elected to defer their equity awards granted in 2024.
2024 Inducement Award Plan
The GRAIL, Inc. 2024 Inducement Award Plan (the “2024 Inducement Plan”) was adopted by GRAIL’s board of directors on August 9, 2024. The 2024 Inducement Plan was adopted to enhance the ability of the Company and any of its subsidiaries to attract, retain and motivate eligible employees by providing these employees with equity ownership opportunities and/or equity-linked compensatory opportunities. The plan is used exclusively for the grant of equity awards to prospective employees who (i) were not previously employees of GRAIL, or (ii) are returning to GRAIL following a bona fide period of non-employment, in any case, in connection with and as an inducement material to such prospective employee’s entering into employment with GRAIL pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). This plan authorizes the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents, performance-based awards, and other stock or cash based awards.

The performance condition for one of the outstanding awards of Performance Options covering 
63,484
 shares that has an exercise price of $
14.00
 per share was met on November 1, 2024, meaning that this option now vests and become exercisable in thirty-six equal monthly installments on the monthly anniversaries of November 1, 2024, subject to continued service through the vesting date. As of 
December 31, 2024,

STATEMENTS
Liability-classified Awards
Performance-Based Award 
The Company has one performance-based award outstanding held by a former employee for which vesting is based on future revenues. The award has an aggregate potential value of up to $
78.0
 million and expires, to the extent unvested, in August 2030. One-fourth of the total potential value of the award vests immediately upon the achievement of cumulative net revenues in any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of $
500.0
 million, $
750.0
 million, $
1.5
 billion, and $
2.0
 billion. The Company assesses the probability of achieving the performance conditions associated with the award on a quarterly basis at each reporting period. If and to the extent that the liability becomes due and payable prior to 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time December 24, 2026 (the “Disposal Funding Period”) and paid by GRAIL, in cash, during the Disposal Funding Period, Illumina will reimburse GRAIL all or such portion of the liability paid by GRAIL in accordance of the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement. As of 
December 31, 2024
, it was not probable that the performance conditions associated with the award would be achieved and, therefore, no stock-based compensation expense, or corresponding loss recovery asset or liability, has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. 
Cash-Based Equity Awards
The Cash-Based Equity Award program was adopted following Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL in 2021 to provide GRAIL employees with dollar-denominated long-term incentive awards that increased or decreased in value based on corresponding changes in GRAIL’s calculated value. GRAIL’s standalone value calculation was estimated by the Company based on its analysis and input from independent valuation advisors. To estimate the value of GRAIL for the purposes of the Cash-Based Equity Awards, various assumptions were used, including long-range financial projections, as well as the discount rate and terminal growth rate. The awards generally vested in four equal installments on the first four anniversaries of the grant date, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. In April 2024, Illumina’s Compensation Committee and Board of Directors (as applicable) approved an adjustment of the ordinary course payouts for all outstanding Cash-Based Equity Awards providing that the Cash-Based Equity Awards would be paid based on their nominal (face) values without adjustment based on changes in equity value. Subsequent to this adjustment to the Cash-Based Equity Awards and continuing until the Award Modification, the Cash-Based Equity Awards were expensed based on such nominal (face) value in accordance with their applicable vesting schedules. The payments in respect of the Cash-Based Equity Awards between the adoption of such adjustment and the Distribution Date were paid out in cash at the applicable Cash-Based Equity Awards’ nominal (face) value. Payments in respect of the Cash-Based Equity Awards before such adjustment were paid out in cash based on the adjusted value of the Cash-Based Equity Award on the applicable vesting date.
During the second quarter of 2024, one-time Cash-Based Equity Awards were granted to GRAIL employees, including executives, for retention purposes (“2024 Transition Incentive Awards”) with a total grant date fair value of $
40.2
 million which were treated as a liability-classified awards. Each 2024 Transition Award vests entirely in 
one year
 or less from its grant date, subject to the applicable holder’s continued service through the vesting date or, if earlier upon (i) the applicable holder’s termination due to death or disability or (ii) following a “change in control” (as defined in the award agreement evidencing the 2024 Transition Incentive Awards), the applicable holder’s termination without “cause” or for “good reason” (each as defined in the award agreement evidencing the 2024 Transition Incentive Awards). In connection with the Spin-Off, the 2024 Transition Incentive Awards were converted into RSUs covering 
2.5
 million shares in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement by dividing the aggregate award value by the volume-weighted average share price over the first 
four
 trading days following the Spin-Off. On the modification date, June 28, 2024, these liability-classified 2024 Transition Incentive Awards in the amount of $
4.4
 million were reclassified to Additional Paid-In Capital.
In connection with the Spin-Off, all outstanding Cash-Based Equity Awards, with the exception of the 2024 Transition Incentive Awards described above, were modified and converted into RSUs in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement, with the number of RSUs determined by dividing the Aggregate Award Value (as discussed below) for such Cash-Based Equity Award by the volume-weighted average share price of GRAIL stock on the first 
four
 trading days following the Spin-Off. All other terms and conditions of the awards, including vesting 
F-29

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS
and payment terms, were unaffected by the conversion. All other terms and conditions of the awards, including vesting and payment terms, were unaffected by the conversion. For each Cash-Based Equity Award, the “Aggregate Award Value” is equal to, (i) for the portion of such award originally scheduled to vest in 2024, the initial grant value of such portion, and (ii) for the remaining unvested portion of such award, the initial grant value of such portion adjusted up or down based on a percentage, with such percentage determined by (A) GRAIL’s average closing market capitalization for the four trading days immediately following the distribution date minus the aggregate equity value of GRAIL at the time the Cash-Based Equity Award was granted, as reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Illumina (the “Baseline Equity Value”), divided by (B) the Baseline Equity Value.
Upon modification, the awards became equity-classified. The value of tranches of the Cash-Based Equity Awards that vest in future years (exclusive of the 2024 Transition Incentive Awards described above) was reduced and, as a result, there was no incremental compensation cost. Approximately 
1,300
 grantees were impacted by this modification. On the modification date, June 28, 2024, the liability-classified awards were reclassified to Additional Paid-In Capital at their fair value in the amount of $
50.3
 million. Due to the higher value of the 2024 tranche of the Cash-Based Equity Awards, compensation cost will be recognized over the vesting period to ensure compensation cost has been recognized at least equal to the amount that is legally vested. As the result of this modification, the Cash-Based Equity Awards that were outstanding on the Distribution Date (in addition to the 2024 Transition Incentive Awards) were converted to 
4.0
 million RSUs to be settled in GRAIL RSUs shares.

Replacement Awards
Illumina issued Replacement Awards to GRAIL employees in exchange for any of their remaining outstanding and unvested GRAIL equity awards as of the Closing Date. The Replacement Awards, granted under Illumina’s 2015 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2015 Stock Plan), consisted of restricted stock units and performance stock options that were issued as shares of Illumina common stock at vesting. Replacement Awards granted in the form of restricted stock units generally vested over a 
two-year
 period with equal vesting quarterly. The terms of the Replacement Awards were substantially similar to the former GRAIL equity awards for which they were exchanged.

As of the Distribution Date, there were two remaining unvested Performance Options. In connection with the Spin-Off, unvested replacement performance-based stock options previously issued to GRAIL employees to purchase Illumina common stock were converted into Performance Options in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement. On June 28, 2024, the modification date, the Company accounted for the modification of the two Performance Options as Type I (for the Performance Option for which the performance condition was met on November 1, 2024) and Type IV (for the Performance Option for which achievement of the performance condition was considered not probable) modifications, respectively. These options were converted at a ratio equal to the average of the volume weighted average per share price of Illumina stock trading during the four days immediately preceding the Distribution Date divided by the average of volume weighted average per share price of GRAIL common stock on the first four trading days immediately following the Distribution Date. 
For the Performance Option with Type I modification, the incremental charge recognized of the difference in the fair value of the option before and immediately after the modification was immaterial. For the Performance Option with Type IV modification, the fair value of the award as of the Modification Date will be used for expense purposes once the award becomes probable of achievement.
As the result of this modification, the Performance Options that were outstanding on the Distribution Date were converted to 
0.1
 million options.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS
The Company is subject to various claims, complaints, regulatory proceedings, and legal actions that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.
Antitrust and Competition Proceedings
On March 30, 2021, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) issued an administrative complaint seeking to prevent the Acquisition. On September 1, 2022, an administrative law judge issued a decision in favor of the transaction and dismissed the FTC’s complaint. The FTC’s complaint counsel appealed to the full FTC Commission. On March 31, 2023, the FTC Commission issued a decision overturning the administrative law judge’s prior ruling. GRAIL and Illumina appealed the FTC’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (“Fifth Circuit”). On December 15, 2023, the Fifth Circuit issued its opinion and order, in which the court ruled that the FTC applied the incorrect standard in assessing Illumina’s open offer contract and, on that basis, vacated the FTC order and remanded the case to the FTC for reconsideration of the effects of the open offer contract under the proper standard as described in the Fifth Circuit Court’s decision, and in all other respects upheld the FTC’s decision. Following completion of the Spin-Off, the Company and Illumina sought dismissal of the FTC’s complaint on July 30, 2024. On August 15, 2024, the FTC dismissed without prejudice the complaint on 
F-33

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS
the basis that the Spin-Off effectively abandoned the transaction giving rise to the complaint (the “FTC Dismissal”).
On April 19, 2021, the European Commission accepted a request for a referral of the GRAIL, Inc. acquisition for European Union merger review, submitted by a Member State of the European Union (France), and joined by several other EEA Member States (Belgium, Greece, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Norway), under Article 22(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (the “EU Merger Regulation”). On April 28, 2021, Illumina filed an action in the General Court of the European Union (the “EU General Court”) asking for annulment of the European Commission’s assertion of jurisdiction to review the Acquisition under Article 22 of the EU Merger Regulation, as the Acquisition did not meet the jurisdictional criteria under the EU Merger Regulation or under the national merger control laws of any Member State of the European Union. On July 13, 2022, the EU General Court confirmed the European Commission’s jurisdiction to examine the Acquisition (“EU General Court Article 22 Judgment”). On September 22 and September 30, 2022, Illumina and the Company each asked for annulment of the EU General Court Article 22 Judgment at the Court of Justice of the European Union (“EU Court of Justice”). On September 3, 2024, the EU Court of Justice set aside the EU General Court’s judgment and annulled the European Commission’s decision to review Illumina’s acquisition of Grail on the basis the European Commission did not have the jurisdiction to do so (the “ECJ Decision”).
During the period between the initial assertion of jurisdiction by the European Commission on April 19, 2021 and the completion of the Spin-Off, the European Commission adopted several additional orders consisting of orders imposing interim measures on October 29, 2021 and October 28, 2022 (the “Interim Measures Orders”), a decision finding Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL, Inc. incompatible with the internal market in the European Union on September 6, 2022 and a decision requiring Illumina to divest the Company and to restore the situation prevailing before the Company’s acquisition by Illumina (the “Divestment Decision”). The Company operated under the Interim Measures Decisions from the period of adoption through the Spin-Off. The Spin-Off was conducted pursuant to the Divestment Decision and a divestment plan prepared by Illumina and approved by the European Commission as provided by the terms of the Divestment Decision. With the completion of the Spin-Off and the effectiveness of the ECJ Decision, these additional orders are no longer in effect.
With the completion of the Spin-Off, the FTC Dismissal and the ECJ Decision, the Company believes these matters are substantially concluded.
SEC Inquiry Letter
We may also be a party or otherwise involved in new litigation proceedings regarding the Acquisition. For example, in July 2023, Illumina was informed that the staff of the SEC was conducting an investigation relating to Illumina and was requesting documents and communications primarily related to Illumina’s acquisition of GRAIL and certain statements and disclosures concerning GRAIL, our products and the acquisition, and related to the conduct and compensation of certain members of Illumina and GRAIL management, among other things. GRAIL is cooperating with the SEC in this investigation.
Federal Securities Class Actions
 On November 11, 2023, the first of three securities class action complaints was filed against Illumina and certain of its current and former executive officers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The first-filed case is captioned Kangas v. Illumina, Inc. et al., the second-filed case is captioned Roy v. Illumina, Inc. et al., and the third-filed case is captioned Louisiana Sheriffs’ Pension & Relief Fund v. Illumina, Inc. et al. (collectively, the “Actions”). The complaints generally allege, among other things, that defendants made materially false and misleading statements and omitted material facts relating to Illumina’s acquisition of Grail. The complaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees, and costs. On January 9, 2024, four movants filed motions to consolidate the Actions and to appoint a lead plaintiff (“Lead Plaintiff Motions”). On April 11, 2024, the Court issued an order consolidating the Actions into a single action (captioned in re Illumina, Inc. Securities Litigation No. 23-cv-2082-LL-MMP), and appointed Universal-Investment-Gesellschaft mbH, UI BVK Kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH, and ACATIS Investment Kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH as lead plaintiffs. (the “Lead Plaintiffs”). On June 21, 2024, the Lead Plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. 
F-34
Table o
f Contents
GRAIL,
 Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS
The amended complaint alleges that GRAIL, in addition to Illumina, and certain of their respective current and former directors and others violated sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 in connection with Illumina's acquisition of GRAIL and disclosures concerning the same. GRAIL has an indemnification obligation for certain current and former directors and officers involved in the matter pursuant to indemnification agreements entered into by these individuals and GRAIL. On September 13, 2024 the plaintiffs further amended the complaint. On November 12, 2024, the Company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended consolidated complaint. On December 20, 2024, the Lead Plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion to dismiss. The defendants’ final reply brief was filed on February 3, 2025. No hearing date has been set. The Company denies the allegations in the complaints and intends to vigorously defend the litigation.
Other Legal Matters
Legal matters include various claims, complaints, and legal actions that arise from time to time. In addition to direct involvement in legal matters, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its current and former directors, executive officers, and certain other officers to provide these directors and officers with indemnification, and has certain indemnification obligations under the Company’s charter and bylaws to these individuals, which may give rise to liability for the Company even if the Company is not directly named. The Company has indemnification obligations in respect of the Kangas Actions and with respect to other legal matters that may arise, or have arisen, from time to time. There can be no assurance that existing or future legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.
The Company is involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to employment matters. In connection with these matters, the Company assesses, on a regular basis, the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters. A liability is recorded in the consolidated financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Since litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The Company regularly reviews outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures. The Company may change its estimates if its assessment of the various factors changes and the amount of ultimate loss may differ from estimates, resulting in a material effect on the Company’s business, financial statements. As of 
December 31, 2024
, there were 
no
 pending litigation with any probable losses that can be reasonably estimated
.
Contingencies
Contingencies primarily correspond to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. If necessary, these contingencies will be accrued, to the extent believed to be reasonably estimable to resolve the matter. The accrued contingency amounts are included in other current liabilities. Should the Company not be able to secure the terms it expects, these estimates may change and will be recognized in the period in which they are identified.
In connection with the Spin-Off, Illumina provided the Company with disposal funding in the amount of $
932.3
 million in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, subject to a clawback feature. The clawback is triggered if, prior to September 24, 2025 (the 
15
-month anniversary of the Distribution Date), the Company (i) consummates a change in control of the Company or (ii) (1) pays any dividend on, or makes any other distribution in respect of, any shares of its capital stock or other equity or voting interests (other than a stock dividend or a stock split), or otherwise consummates a return of capital from GRAIL to any of its equity holders or (2) redeems, purchases or otherwise acquires any of its outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interests (other than the acquisition of any shares in order to effectuate a “net settlement” transaction for the purposes of satisfying tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the grant, vesting, exercise and/or settlement of any outstanding incentive equity awards of GRAIL held by its current or former employees). If the Company consummates a transaction described in the foregoing clause (i), the Company must return to Illumina a cash amount decreasing over time calculated by reference to the number of months which have elapsed since the Distribution Date at the time of the public announcement of the event giving rise to the change of control. If the

STATEMENTS
Company consummates a transaction described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Company must return to Illumina a cash amount equal to the payments made by the Company in connection with such transaction. The amount of clawback payments made cannot exceed the amount of the initial disposal funding. As of 
December 31, 2024
, no contingency liability was recorded as the contingent loss is not probable.
On June 21, 2024, in connection with the Spin-Off, Illumina and the Company also entered into the Tax Matters Agreement to govern the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Illumina and the Company after the Spin-Off with respect to all tax matters and will include restrictions to preserve the tax-free status of the Distribution. The Tax Matters Agreement included a number of restrictions on the Company to preserve the intended tax treatment of the Spin-Off. Breach of any covenant or representation contained in the Tax Matters Agreement will result in liability to specific separation taxes. As of 
December 31, 2024
, as it was not probable that the Company will breach the agreement, no contingent liability was recorded in connection with the Tax Matters Agreement.
NOTE 11. 
RESTRUCTURING
On August 9, 2024, following a portfolio review, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (“Restructuring Plan”) designed to re-prioritize the Company’s resources to focus on its core MCED business and reduce overall spend as the Company progresses towards completion of registrational studies and premarket approval application (“PMA”) submission. The Restructuring Plan was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, and the Company incurred approximately $
18.3
 million of total 
restructuring
 charges from August 9, 2024 through December 31, 2024, consisting primarily of employee severance, benefits, payroll taxes, asset impairments and other associated costs.

no
 common shares issued and outstanding. In connection with the Spin-Off, on June 24, 2024, there were 
31.0
 million shares of GRAIL common stock distributed to Illumina stockholders. This share amount is utilized for the calculation of basic and diluted

A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved. The evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence, including operating results and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences such as the deferred tax liabilities related to purchased intangibles. Based on the available evidence as of December 31, 2024, the Company was not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain deferred tax assets will be realized. Therefore, a valuation allowance of 
$
7.7
 million 
was recorded against certain foreign deferred tax assets.
As of December 31, 2024, the net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes were $
151.0
 million and $
107.1
 million, respectively. Net operating loss carryforwards for state tax purposes will begin to expire in 2039 unless utilized prior. The federal and state tax credit carryforwards were $
6.1
 million and $
4.0
 million. The federal credits will begin to expire in 2044 unless utilized prior. The state credits do not expire and can be carried forward indefinitely. GRAIL’s UK subsidiary had $
21.7
 million of UK net operating losses that can generally be carried forward indefinitely provided that the UK entity maintains its existing trade or business.
Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in its ownership structure. These annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization.

 were $
3.6
 million, $
54.4
 million, and $
47.6
 million, respectively, of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce the effective income tax rate in future periods. The Company has not recognized any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. If interest and penalties are recognized in the future, such amounts will be included in the provision for income taxes.
Tax years 2019 to 2024 remain subject to future examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax. It is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly over the next 12 months. However, due to the number of years remaining that are subject to examination, the Company is unable to estimate a full range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.

On June 21, 2024, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to its Supply and Commercialization Agreement with Illumina. Under the terms of the amended agreement, regardless of whether its products incorporate any Illumina technology, the Company has agreed to pay to Illumina a high single-digit royalty, subject to certain reductions, in perpetuity on net sales generated by its products or revenues otherwise generated or received by the Company, subject to certain exceptions, in the field of oncology. Per the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement with Illumina, the royalty arrangement is suspended until the earlier of December 24, 2026 or any earlier change of control of the Company, at which time a high-single digit royalty payments will be payable.
Contributions from Member, Net
The following related party transactions between the Company and Illumina have been included in these consolidated financial statements. As there was no intercompany loan agreement between Illumina and GRAIL and because these transactions had no history of being settled and were not settled per the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the total net effect of these transactions are reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as cash provided by financing activities and in the consolidated balance sheets as contribution from member, net, in member’s equity.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a‑15(e) and 15d‑15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of 
December 31, 2024
, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include a report of management’s assessment regarding our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) or an attestation report of our independent registered accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies. Additionally, our independent registered accounting firm will not be required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act.
C
hanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Following the Spin-Off, new corporate and governance functions, such as finance, tax, information technology, human resources, treasury and legal, have been implemented to meet all regulatory requirements for a standalone public company. Apart from the foregoing changes, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting the period for the fourth quarter of December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
