Our principal office and laboratory is approximately 74,300 square feet and located at 1525 O’Brien Drive, Menlo Park, California. We amended the related lease in June 2017 to add approximately 57,400 square feet at 11605 Adams Drive, Menlo Park, California. Our lease expires in 2026 and we have an option to extend the lease for an additional five years.
In June 2020, we entered into an agreement to lease approximately 200,000 square feet of a building in Durham, North Carolina. Our lease expires in 2033 and we have three separate options to extend the lease, each for an additional five years.
We hold a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation Registration from the CMS and an accreditation from CAP for our laboratory in Durham, North Carolina, and a Clinical Laboratory Certificate of Deemed Status from the State of California Department of Public Health. 
We believe that our facilities are sufficient to meet our current and anticipated near-term needs.
