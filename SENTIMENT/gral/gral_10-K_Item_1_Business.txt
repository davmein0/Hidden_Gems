Our Company
Our mission is to detect cancer early, when it can be cured.
We are an innovative commercial-stage healthcare company focused on saving lives and shifting the paradigm in early cancer detection. We believe screening individuals for many types of cancer with a single test represents a significant opportunity to reduce the global burden of cancer. Our Galleri test is a commercially available screening test for early detection of multiple types of cancer, which we termed multi-cancer early detection (“MCED”). We believe Galleri is clinically validated based on the results of its clinical studies completed to date, including the results of its foundational case-control Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas (“CCGA”) study and interventional PATHFINDER study, which together enrolled more than 21,000 participants. In these studies, Galleri demonstrated an ability to detect a shared cancer signal through analysis of cell-free DNA in the bloodstream, accurately predict the specific organ or tissue type where the cancer signal originated, and yield high positive predictive values and low false positive rates, all from a simple blood draw. Galleri results can help guide next steps for a diagnosis of cancer by healthcare providers in required follow-up diagnostic testing. We launched Galleri in the United States in mid-2021. As of December 31, 2024, we have sold more than 290,000 commercial tests, more than 137,000 of which were sold in 2024, and established commercial partnerships with stakeholders including leading healthcare systems, employers, payors, and life insurance providers. Commercial use of Galleri has detected some of the most aggressive cancers in early stages including, among others, endometrial, esophageal, gastrointestinal, head and neck, liver, pancreatic, and rectal cancers.
Cancer is a major public health crisis. It is the second leading cause of death both in the United States and worldwide. Most cancers that result in death are diagnosed too late, in advanced stages when they are most challenging to treat. We estimate that more than 70% of cancer deaths result from cancers that have no recommended screening guidelines. In the United States, we consider standard of care screening for cancer to consist of the grade A and B recommendations published by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (“USPSTF”), which currently recommend broad population screening for only four types of cancer using single-cancer screening tests (breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer), and prostate cancer screening, which is USPSTF grade C and is widely implemented in the United States. Grade A and B recommendations are services that USPSTF most highly recommends for preventative care and that have a high or moderate net benefit for patients. Grade C recommendations are services that USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing to patients based on individual circumstances and that have a moderate certainty of a small net benefit for patients. According to data in the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Facts & Figures 2025, cancers for which there are grade A and B recommendations published by the USPSTF (breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer) are expected to result in approximately 225,000 deaths out of approximately 618,000 cancer-related deaths in the United States in 2025, and prostate cancer is expected to result in approximately 36,000 additional deaths. We believe that expanding upon these current guidelines to screen individuals for many types of cancer with a single test represents a significant opportunity to reduce cancer mortality and the cost of cancer care. In 2021, we published modeling data in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2021; 30:460–8) that estimated the potential impact of MCED testing on mortality reduction based on test performance in our CCGA-2 study and using 2006 to 2015 data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute (“SEER”) for ages 50-79. Based on this model, we estimated that by adding Galleri to the five standard of care single-cancer screening tests (breast, cervical, colorectal, lung cancer, and prostate), there is potential to detect many more cancers at an earlier stage, which could translate into the potential to avert approximately 100,000 deaths per year in the United States as measured by five-year survival. We believe this model provides helpful context regarding the potential benefits of screening for multiple cancers at once with a singular screening test, like Galleri, in addition to the five standard of care single-cancer screening tests; however, there can be no assurance when or even if Galleri will be added to the USPSTF guidelines or standard of care screening. In addition, an analysis published in Data (Data. 2017; 2(30):2–16) estimated that diagnosing cancer early could result in $26 billion in annual cost-savings in the United States.
We designed Galleri to detect cancer early. If cancer is detected early, it is more amenable to curative treatment. According to the American Cancer Society, the ability to cure cancer depends on the type and stage of

cancer, the type of treatment the patient receives, and other factors. While there is not one cure for cancer and not all cancers may be cured, according to the World Health Organization many cancers can be cured if detected early and treated effectively and some of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer, and colorectal cancer, have high cure probabilities when detected early and treated according to best practices. Galleri works by detecting DNA fragments shed into the bloodstream by tumor cells. In cancerous cells, methylation, a natural biological process that determines which sections of DNA to turn on or off and that drives tissue differentiation, becomes abnormal. As a result, DNA from cancer has specific methylation patterns that can be used to both identify a general cancer signal and localize that signal to a specific organ or tissue type. In our CCGA study, Galleri identified a shared cancer signal across more than 50 types of cancer, often at an early stage. If a cancer signal is detected, Galleri can accurately predict the tissue type or organ associated with the cancer signal (the cancer signal origin). In our PATHFINDER study, Galleri correctly predicted the first or second cancer signal origins in 22 of 25 participants with a cancer diagnosis following a cancer signal detected (positive) test result (i.e., participants with true positive test results), demonstrating a high cancer signal origin prediction accuracy. Galleri’s screening test results can be used by healthcare providers to guide required follow-up diagnostic testing for a diagnosis of cancer.
As an early pioneer of MCED testing, we have established strong relationships within the cancer and primary care community, including through partnerships with academic and community medical centers, key opinion leaders, and governmental policy and advocacy partners. We have shared evidence supporting our MCED testing at renowned medical conferences, such as the American Association of Cancer Research (“AACR”), American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”), European Society of Medical Oncology (“ESMO”), and American Academy of Family Physicians (“AAFP”). We have also published results from our studies in leading scientific and medical journals, including The Lancet, Nature, Nature Medicine, Cancer Cell, and The Lancet Oncology. Our industry leadership has been recognized with multiple national high profile accolades, including being acknowledged by Time Magazine as one of the Best Inventions of 2022 and The Atlantic as one of the top breakthroughs of 2022, and being named in Fast Company World Changing Ideas of 2022 and in the Fortune Change the World List in 2023.
We plan to pursue U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approval to help support broad access for Galleri in the United States. Galleri is not a diagnostic test and has not been approved or cleared by the FDA. We plan to complete a premarket approval application (“PMA”) submission with the FDA in the first half of 2026. We seek to use data from the NHS-Galleri Trial, together with data from our PATHFINDER 2 study, as well as supplemental data from other clinical studies, to support our planned PMA submission for Galleri in the United States. We believe that FDA approval could unlock broad coverage by large commercial payors in the United States. We have established private reimbursement for Galleri from a number of third-party payors, including self-insured employers, in the United States, but do not currently have broader coverage and reimbursement by government healthcare programs, such as Medicare. We are working with stakeholders to advance and shape the public reimbursement landscape to cover MCED screening for FDA-approved MCED tests. Galleri has not been approved or cleared by the FDA and obtaining PMA approval can take several years from the time a premarket application is submitted. Moreover, the FDA requirements that will govern MCED tests, as well as the breadth and nature of data we must provide the FDA to support the proposed intended use, may be subject to change, and as such it is difficult to predict what information we will need to submit to obtain approval of a PMA from the FDA for a proposed intended use. Following FDA approval, we also expect to pursue inclusion of Galleri in the USPSTF’s guideline recommendation, although such inclusion is not certain even with FDA approval. 
In the United Kingdom, we are working with NHS England to complete our NHS-Galleri Trial. NHS England will evaluate the final results from the NHS-Galleri Trial, which are expected to be available in 2026, before determining whether to implement the Galleri test in the NHS. We believe the decision may include, in addition to an evaluation of the final results, considerations such as NHS budget, political priorities, cost-effectiveness and implementation constraints. We also believe our work with the NHS and the data generated from our NHS-Galleri Trial, if compelling, could help facilitate adoption in other single-payor systems around the world and support evidence of clinical utility worldwide.
Since our founding, we have undertaken a rigorous approach to identify in a blood sample the most informative markers of cancer through what we believe is the largest clinical program in genomic medicine to date. We are collecting population-scale clinical data from more than 385,000 participants across nine clinical studies, with more than 21,000 of these participants included in the studies that supported the development and

launch of Galleri, and over 175,000 individuals enrolled and an additional approximately 50,000 anticipated to be enrolled in interventional studies (NHS-Galleri and PATHFINDER 2, which support our PMA submission, and the first-of-its kind Galleri-Medicare real-world study). These studies include our foundational case-control CCGA study to develop and validate our MCED technology, multiple large-scale observational studies in asymptomatic individuals, and multiple large-scale interventional studies in intended use populations. Our interventional studies include our NHS-Galleri Trial, which is the first and largest randomized controlled trial of an MCED test, and which enrolled more than 140,000 individuals in just over 10 months. These studies also include our initiation of the Real-world Evidence to Advance multi-Cancer early detection Health equity (“REACH” or “Galleri-Medicare”) interventional study. This first-of-its kind real-world Galleri-Medicare study will further evaluate the clinical impact of the Galleri multi-cancer early detection test among Medicare beneficiaries, including racial and ethnic minorities, and seniors from historically underserved communities. Through these studies and our ongoing collection of real-world data, we have built what we believe is an unprecedented longitudinal dataset of high quality, linked clinical and genomic data. 
We believe our clinical studies, including our early discovery work, have demonstrated robust and reproducible test performance. Notably, data from our interventional PATHFINDER study, including positive predictive value (“PPV”), cancer signal original prediction accuracy, and specificity, were generally consistent with data from our case-control CCGA study, which is evidence supporting the generalizability and robustness of Galleri in an interventional study involving analysis of returned Galleri results on clinical diagnostic and care pathways, outside of the foundational case-control context. Specifically, the 43% PPV achieved in the study is similar to our previously published modeled PPV of 44% based on test performance in our CCGA study extrapolated to a potential representative population aged 50-79 based on 2016 to 2017 SEER data. We extrapolated the CCGA-based modeled PPV to a representative population due to the limitations of measuring PPV in a case controlled study with enrichment of cancer cases in the sample set, whereas the PATHFINDER study was performed in an intended use population and PPV was measured directly. Data from our foundational CCGA study was presented in oral and poster presentations at multiple major medical conferences including the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) and were published in Annals of Oncology in 2020 and 2021 and Cancer Cell in 2022. Data from our PATHFINDER study was initially presented at the ESMO in 2021 and published in The Lancet in 2023. Additional data on patient reported outcomes was published in Lancet Oncology in January 2025. We expect to continue to report clinical data from our clinical program over many years.
Based on our extensive, published and peer reviewed discovery work, we believe that a targeted methylation approach, which entails interrogating specific methylation sites within a genome to assess methylation patterns and which is an integral part of the technology used in our Galleri test, is the best approach for detecting a cancer signal and identifying a cancer signal origin. In our head-to-head analyses we compared multiple different classifiers that were trained to detect a cancer signal and predict the cancer signal origin, and which were independently validated. We found that interrogating methylation patterns yielded significantly better results for cancer detection (based on sensitivity, cancer signal origin prediction accuracy, and clinical limit of detection (a measure of the how much signal must exist in order to be detected)) than was observed by interrogating mutations (changes in a DNA sequence), chromosomal alterations (changes to the structure or number of chromosomes, which are strands of genetic material), fragment lengths (differences in length of DNA fragments), and other genomic features, either alone or in combination. In contrast to well-established cancer mutations that only affect a handful of genomic locations, there are nearly 30 million methylation sites across the human genome, making them a ubiquitous and rich signal for cancer detection. After comprehensive analysis of whole-genome methylation patterns in connection with our CCGA study, we discovered highly informative and low-noise methylation sites for cancer signal and cancer signal origin detection. Highly informative sites are likely to have abnormal methylation patterns resulting from cancer, and low-noise sites are less likely to be subject to confounding signals from biological noise resulting from confounding conditions (such as aging, inflammatory conditions) and circulating DNA from non-cancerous cells. This discovery led to our development of a targeted methylation approach. Our targeted methylation approach can detect lower levels of cancer signal in blood compared to the other approaches we examined, enabling early cancer detection in asymptomatic individuals more efficiently compared to whole-genome methylation. Our targeted methylation assay had a clinical limit of detection of approximately 150 parts per million, which was significantly lower than other approaches we assessed.

Our proprietary targeted methylation platform, as well as our growing body of clinical and real-world data, have provided us with unique insights into cancer biology that enable development of products beyond asymptomatic screening. We can leverage our proprietary platform for additional applications, including our precision oncology portfolio. We launched our research use only (“RUO”) targeted methylation platform with customizable classifiers in 2023. We have partnered with a number of leading oncology therapeutics companies to test applications of biomarkers with the goal of optimizing the use of therapeutic interventions. Some of our partnerships also include development of customized applications to support clinical studies and companion diagnostic development and commercialization. Applications for our technology in our precision oncology partnerships include pre-treatment prognosis, post-treatment prognosis or minimal residual disease, biomarker discovery, detection of recurrence, and clinical monitoring. We believe the research and clinical development settings represent significant opportunities with biopharmaceutical companies given the large number of ongoing oncology studies and the significant need to identify residual disease or recurrence early and help inform treatment decisions. In addition to collaborative opportunities with biopharma partners, we believe that our methylation platform could enable standalone clinical products and support patient care across the cancer care continuum in the future.
We have also published data that demonstrates the value of applying our proprietary methylation platform as a diagnostic aid for cancer to accelerate diagnostic resolution for patients with non-specific signs and symptoms, but with a clinical suspicion of cancer. We believe these products and other future products in development have the potential to reach additional customers and may result in additional patient care solutions across the cancer care continuum.
Our Strengths
We believe our continued growth will be driven by the following strengths:
•
Our clinically-validated, commercially available, MCED screening test, Galleri.
 Galleri is a commercially available MCED screening test that is setting the standard for multi-cancer early detection. While Galleri has not been approved or cleared by the FDA, we believe Galleri is clinically validated as a screening test based on the results of its clinical studies completed to date. From a simple blood draw, Galleri can detect a cancer signal shared by over 50 types of cancer, over 45 of which do not have recommended screening guidelines. We believe Galleri enables the early detection of cancer in asymptomatic individuals by screening for multiple types of cancer, and in clinical studies has demonstrated a high positive predictive value (“PPV”) and a low false positive rate, and an ability to predict the location of the suspected cancer with high accuracy. Galleri screening test results can help guide next steps for a diagnosis of cancer by healthcare providers in required follow-up diagnostic testing. Further, as Galleri relies on a blood draw, the test can be integrated into existing care pathways, such as annual health checks, which can enable wide scale implementation and increase access to cancer screening, thus helping to address well-known disparities in cancer care. Our industry leadership in MCED testing has been recognized with multiple national high profile accolades.
•
Our established commercial leadership is driving the development of a significant market.
 The commercial opportunity for Galleri is significant, with more than 300 million individuals globally over the age of 50 (our intended use population), including more than 100 million individuals in the United States. We launched Galleri in the United States in mid-2021. As of December 31, 2024, we have sold more than 290,000 commercial tests and established commercial partnerships, including leading healthcare systems, employers, payors, and life insurance providers. In late 2024, we began use of a new version of Galleri in commercial channels which incorporates significant automation and is intended to enable us to scale more efficiently with future demand. Our clinical trials continue to use the same version of Galleri as when they were started, and we expect to conduct any necessary bridging studies from later versions of Galleri in connection with FDA or other regulatory approval. In this real-world setting, Galleri is detecting deadly cancers in early stages, and healthcare providers have self-reported to us that Galleri’s signal origin capability enables them to efficiently direct the pathway following a positive test. As an early proponent of MCED testing, we have established strong relationships within the cancer and primary care community, including through partnerships with academic and

community medical centers, key opinion leaders, and governmental policy and advocacy partners. Our partnership with the NHS presents an opportunity to drive further adoption of Galleri, including by payors and health systems around the world. The NHS will evaluate the final results from the NHS-Galleri Trial, which are expected to be available in 2026, before determining whether to implement the Galleri test in the NHS. We believe the decision will include considerations such as NHS budget, political priorities, cost-effectiveness and implementation constraints in addition to an evaluation of the final results. Our commercial leadership is further supported by our high-capacity laboratory which is equipped to process Galleri tests at population screening volumes.
•
Unprecedented clinical studies and real-world experience.
 We designed and executed what we believe is the largest clinical program in genomic medicine to date. We are collecting population-scale clinical data from more than 385,000 participants across nine clinical studies, with more than 21,000 of these participants included in the studies that supported the development and launch of Galleri, and over 175,000 individuals enrolled and an additional approximately 55,000 anticipated to be enrolled in interventional studies (NHS-Galleri and PATHFINDER 2, which support our PMA submission, and the first-of-its kind Galleri-Medicare real-world study). These studies include our foundational case-control CCGA study to develop and validate our MCED technology, multiple large-scale observational studies in asymptomatic individuals, and multiple large-scale interventional studies. Our interventional studies include our NHS-Galleri Trial, which is the first and largest randomized controlled trial of an MCED test, and which enrolled more than 140,000 individuals in just over 10 months. Through these studies and our ongoing collection of real-world data, we have built what we believe is an unprecedented longitudinal dataset of high quality, linked clinical and genomic data. We believe our clinical studies, including our early discovery work, have demonstrated robust and reproducible test performance. Notably, data, including PPV, cancer signal original prediction accuracy, and specificity, from our interventional PATHFINDER study, which involved analysis of diagnostic and care pathways outside of the case-control context, were generally consistent with data from our case-control CCGA study, which is evidence supporting the consistent performance of Galleri. Together with our partners at leading community and academic medical centers in the United States and United Kingdom, we expect to continue to report ongoing and long-term follow-up clinical data from our studies over many years.
•
Our highly-differentiated methylation platform, which enables product opportunities across the cancer care continuum.
 We have taken a scientifically rigorous approach to develop a deep and comprehensive understanding of cancer biology. We built an atlas to characterize the landscape of cell-free nucleic acids (“cfDNA”) across a broad and diverse population and in individuals with and without cancer. We then used this atlas and other data to train our machine learning algorithms to recognize methylation patterns indicative of cancer and accurately predict the cancer signal origin. These efforts supported the development of our proprietary methylation platform on which Galleri is based, and which we will continue to leverage to advance a number of clinical applications across the cancer care continuum. For example, we developed and launched our post-diagnosis RUO offering and are working closely with biopharmaceutical companies to develop products and services to optimize treatment once a cancer has been diagnosed. Potential applications for our technology in a post-diagnosis setting include pre-treatment prognosis, post-treatment prognosis, biomarker discovery, detection of recurrence, and clinical monitoring. We have also published data supporting the use of our technology to enable faster diagnosis and care for patients presenting with non-specific symptoms that are suspicious for cancer.
•
Our intellectual property portfolio.
 We own or license exclusive worldwide commercial rights to intellectual property covering Galleri and our products in development. Specifically, as of December 31, 2024, we have exclusive licenses to approximately 630 granted patents globally, and own or co-own more than 220 issued patents, with more than 820 pending patent applications (licensed, owned, or co-owned) covering methylation and other technologies. In addition, our patents, trade secrets, and know-how provide broad intellectual property coverage for our products, including chemistry, bioinformatics, and machine learning algorithms used in

Our highly experienced and multidisciplinary team.
 Since our founding, we have built an entrepreneurial culture driven to improve outcomes for cancer patients. We are led by a multidisciplinary team with extensive experience across biotechnology, life sciences, public health, genomics, computer science, data science, biostatistics, clinical development, medical affairs, government and regulatory affairs, quality assurance, and laboratory and commercial operations. We believe this confluence of talent from multiple disciplines has enabled us to make significant progress in improving cancer care and will enable us to remain at the forefront of our industry.
Our Strategy
Key elements of our strategy include:
•
Establishing Galleri as the population multi-cancer screening standard and extending commercial leadership in large global markets. 
We believe we have an unprecedented opportunity to establish a new standard of care by adding Galleri to existing single-cancer screenings, and establish and maintain the market leading position in cancer detection. The commercial opportunity for Galleri is significant, with more than 300 million individuals in major global markets over the age of 50, including over 100 million individuals in the United States. Our goal is to address cancer screening globally, beginning in large markets with established health systems, such as the United States and United Kingdom, and extending to other markets over time through both direct market entry and distributors. We will continue to engage with key opinion leaders, healthcare providers, advocacy organizations, regulators, and payors to help drive broader scientific and commercial endorsement worldwide. In addition, we believe Galleri’s performance will drive clinical outcomes and high patient and provider satisfaction that will lead to further awareness and adoption.
•
Expanding access to our products by pursuing FDA approval and reimbursement and coverage from payors. 
Our ability to impact cancer outcomes will be accelerated in markets where we secure reimbursement for our products. Prior to broader coverage and reimbursement in the United States, we will continue our work with clinics and health systems to accelerate utilization, and with self-insured employers and health insurers to offer and cover Galleri. In the United States, we have established private reimbursement from a number of self-insured employers and multiple payors and health systems as of December 31, 2024, but do not currently have broad coverage and reimbursement by government healthcare programs, such as Medicare. We plan to pursue FDA approval to help support broad access for Galleri in the United States. We plan to complete a PMA submission with the FDA in the first half of 2026. We seek to use data from the NHS-Galleri Trial, together with data from our PATHFINDER 2 study, as well as supplemental data from other clinical studies, to support our planned PMA submission for Galleri in the United States. We believe that FDA approval could unlock large commercial payors in the United States and we are working with stakeholders to advance and shape the public reimbursement landscape in the United States to enable coverage of FDA-approved MCED tests by Medicare. Galleri has not been approved or cleared by the FDA and obtaining PMA approval can take several years, if at all, from the time a premarket application is submitted. Moreover, the FDA requirements that will govern MCED tests, as well as the breadth and nature of data we must provide the FDA to support the proposed intended use, may be subject to change, and as such it is difficult to predict what information we will need to submit to obtain approval of a PMA from the FDA for a proposed intended use. Following FDA approval, we also expect to pursue inclusion of Galleri in the USPSTF’s guideline recommendation, although such inclusion is not certain even with FDA approval. In the United Kingdom, we are working with NHS England to complete our NHS-Galleri Trial. The NHS will evaluate the final results from the NHS-Galleri Trial, which are expected to be available in 2026, alongside other factors, before determining whether to implement the Galleri test in the NHS. We believe our work with the NHS and the data generated from our NHS-Galleri Trial, if favorable, could help facilitate adoption in other single-

payor systems around the world and support evidence of clinical utility worldwide. We will continue to invest in clinical evidence generation and work with regulatory bodies and payors in our target markets to expand coverage for early cancer screening and to increase access.
•
Defining, leading, and expanding adoption of MCED.
 We coined the term “multi-cancer early detection” and will continue to drive MCED as a solution to one of healthcare’s most important challenges. Since our inception in 2016, we have established and maintained a leading voice regarding the early detection of multiple cancer types in peer-reviewed literature. As of December 31, 2024, we have published more than 70 manuscripts, including in high profile journals like The Lancet, Nature, Nature Medicine, Cancer Cell, and The Lancet Oncology. We have also presented our data in more than 30 podium and 200 poster presentations at renowned medical conferences, including AACR, ASCO, ESMO, and AAFP. We fund medical education programs for MCED and intend to continue to educate healthcare providers, as well as key opinion leaders, regulators, professional societies, and policymakers on the clinical benefits and public health impact of MCED. In addition, we believe this market development strategy will drive adoption of our products and further awareness of the benefits of MCED testing generally.
•
Leveraging our existing infrastructure to enable and scale our growing business.
 Over the last several years, we have made significant investments to build a scalable infrastructure capable of meeting significant demand while satisfying stringent certification parameters. Our high-capacity laboratory is accredited by the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) and certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) and the New York State Department of Health, which represent one of the most rigorous levels of validation required for laboratory developed tests. With the roll-out of our new version of Galleri, our facility is able to process test volumes in excess of our current forecasts without requiring significant additional investment in capital expenditures. In addition, we engineered custom technology infrastructure and cloud-based tools to enable scalable data collection and analysis capabilities. Our ability to collect, manage, and integrate high-quality genomic and clinical data is central to our business, and our automated laboratory workflows and processes enable high volumes of tests and samples to be processed automatically with high efficiency and speed and low failure rates. As demand for our products increases, we expect to leverage the scale efficiencies of our infrastructure and platform technology, which we believe will positively impact margins over time.
•
Driving cutting edge science and technology to continuously improve existing products and develop new products.
 Our methylation platform and extensive technological infrastructure, together with expansive ongoing data collection, will continue to drive improvements to Galleri and enable the development of additional products. Our technology has broad applicability in cancer detection and management, and findings from our SYMPLIFY study demonstrated the potential of our platform to extend beyond asymptomatic screening, into symptomatic detection. We launched our RUO offering, a part of our precision oncology portfolio, in 2023, which has formed the basis of additional biopharmaceutical partnerships to enable further discovery and execution of new development programs. In addition, these partnerships have generated findings that support expansion into precision oncology applications, including pre- and post-treatment prognosis, recurrence detection, and clinical monitoring. We continually seek to enhance the performance of our products through a comprehensive, rigorous approach to ongoing classifier training, improvement of features, and reduced processing time and cost. Further, we plan to improve our products to enhance performance, offerings, scalability, and/or cost of goods. New products, including enhanced versions of current products, will require the completion of certain clinical development and regulatory activities, such as any required non-inferiority studies using data (for example, clinical data and/or real world evidence data obtained through Galleri’s commercial use) and/or bridging studies, which may be agreed upon with regulatory authorities. We will continue to improve our technologies and launch innovative products across the cancer care continuum.

Improving Cancer Care
The Burden of Cancer and the Benefits of Earlier Detection
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in both the United States and worldwide, with more than 19 million new cases and 10 million deaths globally in 2020. This burden is expected to grow as the global population ages. According to the data in the American Cancer Society’s 
Cancer Facts & Figures 2025
, there will be approximately 2.0 million new cancer cases and 618,000 cancer deaths in the United States in 2025. An analysis published in the AACR’s Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention Journal (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2020; 29(7):1304–1312) estimated that $201 billion was spent on cancer care in the United States in 2020, with some of the costliest treatments targeting late-stage cancers that are highly challenging to treat. The same analysis projected that by 2030, the cost of cancer in the United States would rise to more than $246 billion annually, driven by an aging population and rising costs of care. According to an article published in 
JAMA Oncology
 in February 2023 (JAMA Oncol. 2023; 9(4):465–472), it is estimated that the global economic cost of cancer from 2020 to 2050 will be approximately $25 trillion.
A fundamental driver of cancer mortality today is that most cancers that result in death are diagnosed too late, in advanced stages when they are most challenging to treat. If cancer is detected early, when it is localized, it is more amenable to curative treatment. According to the American Cancer Society, the ability to cure cancer depends on the type and stage of cancer, the type of treatment the patient receives, and other factors. While there is not one cure for cancer and not all cancers may be cured, according to the World Health Organization many cancers can be cured if detected early and treated effectively and some of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer, and colorectal cancer, have high cure probabilities when detected early and treated according to best practices. According to 2006 to 2015 data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute (“SEER”), across all cancers, the five-year cancer-specific survival rate is approximately 89% when localized, compared to 21% when the cancer is metastasized. Historically, a key challenge to early detection is that there has been no mechanism to detect most cancers while individuals are asymptomatic. Detecting cancers at earlier stages could potentially reduce cancer-related five-year mortality by at least 15-24%, according to a model published in the AACR’s 
Cancer

Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention Journal
 in May 2020 (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2020; 29 (5): 895–902).
Treatment costs increase by stage across all cancers, and, according to an article published in the 
Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
 in April 2018, (J Natl Compr. Canc. Netw. 2018 Apr; 16(4):402–410), treating cancers that are in more advanced stages can be up to two to four times more costly than treating cancers at earlier stages. In addition, an analysis published in Data (Data. 2017; 2(30):2–16) estimated that diagnosing cancer early could result in $26 billion (approximately 17% of total treatment costs) in annual cancer treatment cost-savings in the United States.

Our commercially available multi-cancer early detection screening test, Galleri, is transforming cancer care and has the potential to unlock substantial improvements in cancer detection and mortality. 
A fundamental driver of cancer mortality today is that most cancers that result in death are diagnosed too late, in advanced stages when they are most challenging to treat. If cancer is detected early, when it is localized, it is more amenable to curative treatment. Galleri is designed to complement the USPSTF’s recommended screenings, be easy to implement in practice, and improve overall population cancer detection. From a simple

blood draw, Galleri can detect a cancer signal shared by over 50 types of cancer, over 45 of which do not have recommended screening guidelines. We believe Galleri enables the early detection of cancer in asymptomatic individuals by screening for multiple types of cancer, and in clinical studies Galleri has demonstrated an ability to predict the location of the suspected cancer with high accuracy (88%), and high PPVs and low false positive rates. For additional information, see “Business—Our Clinical Studies.” Galleri screening test results can help guide next steps for a diagnosis of cancer by healthcare providers in required follow-up diagnostic testing. We launched Galleri in the United States in mid-2021. As of December 31, 2024, we have sold more than 290,000 commercial tests. In this real-world setting, Galleri has detected deadly cancers in early stages. Our test has been deployed across healthcare systems, employers, payors, and life insurance providers, and for additional at-risk groups such as first responders, including firefighters, and continues to unlock the promise of early cancer detection. 
We developed Galleri with the following critical features necessary to address the requirements of a population-scale MCED screening test: 
Ability to identify a broad range of cancer types

Galleri is able to detect a cancer signal shared across many types of cancer, including the most deadly types of cancer that do not have recommended screens. We believe that Galleri can significantly increase the number of cancer types screened for in the population and has the potential to increase yield of cancers in the United States that are diagnosed through screening from 14% to 49%. 
High PPV and low false positive rate

In clinical studies, Galleri has demonstrated a high PPV of approximately 43% and a low false positive rate of less than 1%. A high PPV, which is enabled in part by a low false positive rate, is important in clinical practice because it represents the probability that a positive test result is a true positive and can give clinicians high confidence and a sense of urgency to initiate confirmatory diagnostic workups. A low false positive rate can help to limit unnecessary workups on patients who do not have cancer. While Galleri is designed to complement the current standard of care screening tests, Galleri’s high PPV of approximately 43% is significantly higher than the PPV of all of the standard of care single-cancer screening tests. Galleri’s low false positive rate of less than 1% is also significantly lower than the false positive rate of all of the standard of care single-cancer screening tests. 
Ability to predict with high accuracy the cancer signal origin and direct diagnostic workup

In our PATHFINDER study, Galleri demonstrated a high (88%) cancer signal origin prediction accuracy for identifying the location of cancer, which supports physician approaches to diagnostic resolution through well-established workup pathways. Cancer signal origin prediction accuracy represents the extent to which first and second origins identified were correct among true positive tests. In our PATHFINDER study, the first workup based on cancer signal origin facilitated a diagnostic resolution in 25 of the 32 participants who had diagnostic resolution (approximately 80%). Importantly, this group of 32 participants consisted of only those who received a cancer signal detected result from both Galleri and an earlier version of our MCED test also being studied in our PATHFINDER study. We also found that Galleri’s cancer signal origin prediction generally facilitated diagnosis in less than three months (median of 79 days) among participants who had a cancer signal detected. Further, Galleri’s cancer signal origin prediction capability enables physicians to limit the use of full body imaging following cancer signal detected results, which can be expensive, not readily accessible to broad patient populations, exposes patients to radiation, and can lead to false alarms and unnecessary ancillary workups. In the commercial setting healthcare providers have self reported to us that Galleri’s signal origin capability enables them to efficiently direct the pathway following a positive test.
Backed by robust analytical and clinical performance

Galleri screening test performance is validated by extensive clinical studies. We have established a broad population-scale clinical evidence program, including the more than 21,000 participants included in the studies that supported the development and launch of Galleri. We believe we established clinical validation using a locked assay and classifier in case-control and intended-use populations. A locked assay means that the assay and classifier are fully specified, with no further adjustments. A locked assay and classifier produce the same result,

within process control limits, when the same input is applied. A case-control study is a type of observational study that interrogates factors associated with diseases or outcomes. These studies include a group of “cases” (
e.g.
, participants with cancer) and a group of “controls” (
e.g.
, participants without cancer). A case-control study can, for example, be used to establish performance characteristics and for clinical validation. Our CCGA study is an example of a case-control study, in that it enrolled participants with a cancer diagnosis (cases) and participants without a cancer diagnosis (controls). Importantly, study design and product development processes were robust enough to enable translation of similar performance from our foundational case control CCGA study to our interventional PATHFINDER study without seeing a degradation of performance. We have shared evidence supporting Galleri’s performance at renowned medical conferences and published results from our studies in leading scientific and medical journals. 
Ability to limit overdiagnosis of indolent cancers
Data across our clinical studies suggests that although Galleri detects cancer signals for some of the most aggressive cancers, detection of cancer signals for indolent cancer types, which people are less likely to die from, is low. For example, data published in JCO Precision Oncology in 2024 demonstrated that prostate cancers that were detected by Galleri were more aggressive and clinically significant as compared to indolent and slow growing cancers. We believe these results demonstrate that the use of MCED tests in a population-based screening program is unlikely to contribute to overdiagnosis of slow-growing prostate cancers that may not need treatment. 
Application to a diverse population

Galleri has been validated in population-scale clinical studies to help detect cancer across broad populations that are diverse in behaviors (such as smoking), non-cancer diseases, environmental exposures, age, gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and other confounding indications and differences. For example, in published data from our CCGA study, we found no differences in performance across racial subgroups. Understanding the signals associated with population diversity is important to our ability to account for biological noise and develop high-specificity tests for a broad testing population. The inclusion of confounding conditions in our studies, such as aging and inflammatory conditions, enables us to discriminate true cancer signals from biological noise. 
We continue to study Galleri in population-scale studies that evaluate the effectiveness of the test in diverse and high-risk populations. For example, we have worked with clinics, fire departments, municipalities, and unions to test thousands of firefighters, who generally have exposure-related increased risk of cancer. We established a research collaboration with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), the largest healthcare system in the United States, and the Veterans Health Foundation to provide Galleri to 10,000 veterans, many of whom are at high risk for cancer, across multiple participating VA sites over a three-year clinical study period. In addition, in our SUMMIT study, we are evaluating Galleri in a population of individuals at high risk for lung and other smoking-related cancers. Additionally, we implemented multiple strategies to enroll a diverse and representative sample for our 140,000 participant NHS-Galleri study to enable trial results to be widely applicable.
Complementary to standard of care screenings

In the United States, the five standard of care single-cancer screening tests (breast, cervical, colorectal, lung cancer, and prostate) have helped to reduce mortality for these specific types of cancer. Galleri expands upon the current standard of care guidelines to screen individuals with a single test for many types of cancer, most of which have no recommended screenings. We envision a world where Galleri is broadly accessible and used routinely alongside current standard of care screenings, potentially annually, to drive significant improvements in patient care and reduce cancer mortality and the cost of cancer care. 
To estimate the potential impact of early cancer detection and mortality reduction, we developed and published a cancer epidemiology forecast model. In 2021, we published modeling data in 
Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention
 (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2021; 30:460–8) that estimated the potential impact of MCED testing on mortality reduction based on test performance in our CCGA-2 study and using 2006 to 2015 SEER data for ages 50-79. Based on this model, we estimate that by adding Galleri to the five standard of care single-cancer screening tests (breast, cervical, colorectal, lung cancer, and prostate), there is potential to

detect many more cancers at an earlier stage, which could translate into the potential to avert approximately 100,000 deaths per year in the United States as measured by five-year survival, or 39% of the five-year deaths expected if not for early detection by Galleri. We believe this model provides helpful context regarding the potential benefits of screening for multiple cancers at once with a singular screening test, like Galleri, in addition to the five standard of care single-cancer screening tests; however, there can be no assurance when or even if Galleri will be added to the USPSTF guidelines or standard of care screening. 
In addition, we estimate that in a population of approximately 107 million individuals between the ages of 50-79 in the United States, adding Galleri to the five standard of care single-cancer screening tests could result in the detection of an additional 460,000 cancer cases. Our model shows that the use of Galleri together with standard of care screenings could lead to the detection of three times as many cancer cases overall as compared to standard of care screenings alone, with only 6.5% more incremental false positives. We estimate that identification of many more cancer cases with a limited number of additional false positives would reduce the cost to diagnose one cancer by approximately 65%. 
Simple to implement and access

Galleri is administered via a simple blood draw that enhances patient access and is easy for healthcare providers to implement. We believe ease of a blood draw can increase compliance by reducing some of the barriers that have limited the adoption of certain individual cancer screening tests, including the time to obtain the screening test as well as access to specialists and specialized equipment. In the commercial setting, healthcare providers have self-reported to us that Galleri’s cancer signal of origin capability enables them to efficiently direct the pathway following a positive test. The test is available through a wide range of in-person and telemedicine care settings in the United States. Galleri is conveniently accessible to patients who can complete the blood draw at physician offices, reference labs, and mobile phlebotomy labs, among other locations. In addition, Galleri can be easily integrated into routine practice, where healthcare providers can order Galleri as part of an annual examination. 
Support Services for Physicians that Drive a Positive Patient Experience 
We have developed a suite of support services to optimize the test experience for healthcare providers and patients. We believe it is important that cancer signal detected patients and their healthcare providers are supported as they navigate follow-ups such as scheduling a confirmatory diagnostic procedure. For all cancer signal detected results, our medical science liaisons connect with the ordering provider via email or phone to offer support in clinical decision making. Clinical care documents are shared with the healthcare provider that describe published clinical guidelines to help guide next steps in the diagnostic work-up. Healthcare providers can additionally elect to access a Galleri experience council—a cohort of physicians (including experts from National Cancer Institute designated cancer centers) with experience with Galleri who can provide peer-to-peer consultations. We also operate an early cancer detection board, analogous to a tumor board, that includes third-party experts across specialties to discuss any challenging cases for which advice is sought. We offer patients a post-cancer signal detected result support center that provides materials they can bring to a referral to ensure the receiving physician understands the cancer signal detected test result to facilitate urgent care for such patients. 
In addition, our software systems support a positive experience for providers and their patients. Our provider portal is designed to allow physicians to order our test and obtain patient consent electronically, which is efficient and helps minimize errors and incomplete user information. We designed our software systems to integrate with third-party electronic medical record systems to streamline test ordering and results delivery. Importantly, for every test we process, we provide a clinically actionable test report, as depicted in the graphic below, that is delivered through our secure web portal to the ordering healthcare providers to show whether or not a cancer signal is detected, and if so, to predict where in the body the cancer signal is located. 
Through commercial and clinical use of Galleri, we’ve collected a number of positive patient testimonials from patients where Galleri detected a cancer signal, including from patients who have self-identified in media stories.
Investment to Enhance Versions of Tests

We seek to continually enhance the performance and features of Galleri. Commercial use and ongoing research programs provide valuable data that we believe can enhance test performance. Real-world evidence is already informing product improvements today. We will leverage even larger datasets to further develop our advanced machine learning algorithms. By further refining and selecting subsets of highly informative regions for cancer signal origin detection to reduce panel size, we could achieve deeper sequencing coverage and lower sequencing costs. We also aim to further improve the sensitivity of our tests by obtaining deeper sequencing coverage and a better understanding of noise and leveraging even larger datasets to further develop our advanced machine learning algorithms. We also continue to research and develop technologies that have the potential to complement methylation through orthogonal biological information, including additional analytes and biofluids such as proteins and urine. New products, including enhanced versions of current products, will require the completion of certain clinical development and regulatory activities, such as non-inferiority studies using clinical study data and real world evidence data obtained through Galleri’s commercial use and bridging studies to measure and evaluate concordance, performance and safety of a subsequent, enhanced version of our product versus the relevant existing product. Any bridging study may use previously collected clinical study data and other samples, and will need to be agreed upon with regulatory authorities. 
Precision Oncology Portfolio 
The precision oncology market is expected to grow significantly in the coming years, and multiple research studies have indicated that liquid biopsies and ctDNA detection will play a major part in this growth. Our precision oncology portfolio currently consists of an RUO-targeted methylation-based platform with customizable classifiers that enables applications for disease prognostication, risk stratification, minimal residual disease (“MRD”) detection and recurrence and relapse monitoring across many cancer types. 
We initiated early collaborations with select, leading biopharmaceutical companies beginning in 2020, and the launch of our RUO offering in early 2023 has unlocked additional partnerships with several leading oncology companies. These partnerships leverage our RUO offering to test applications of biomarkers with the goal of optimizing the use of therapeutic interventions. Partnerships may also include development of customized applications to support clinical studies and companion diagnostic development and commercialization. Our first companion diagnostic partnership was announced in 2022 with AstraZeneca and in 2024, we announced that the first patient has been tested for eligibility with the investigational GRAIL Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (“NSCLC”) ctDNA Assay in AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo’s global TROPION-Lung12 Phase 3 study evaluating adjuvant treatment regimens in patients with Stage I adenocarcinoma NSCLC. We have published or presented early performance data on MCED testing at multiple academic conferences, including ASCO, AACR and ESMO, across different use cases and indications. These data demonstrate the versatility of the platform across multiple applications and areas of clinical unmet need. 
Our RUO offering uses our proprietary targeted methylation platform to analyze cfDNA isolated from peripheral blood for cancer signal interrogation. Our RUO technology estimates tumor burden based on tumor methylation fraction, enabling longitudinal monitoring and surveillance solutions. Data from our studies have demonstrated analytically validated performance, and robust analytical sensitivity, specificity, and precision. For example, in a recent analytical validation study, cfDNA was analyzed from donors with and without cancer. Analytical sensitivity was assessed in 12 different solid tumor types. Results demonstrated strong median limit of detection (“LoD”) of 0.023% based on measures of the abnormally methylated ctDNA fraction. Analytical specificity was 98.5% and overall precision across all replicates was 94.6%. The low input requirements support retrospective research studies. Retrospective studies are generally performed using banked samples stored in a freezer. Banked samples may be subject to reduced cfDNA levels (due to reduced plasma volume, sample degradation, or collection in tubes not optimized for cfDNA stability). As a result, a low limit of detection is important to facilitate performance of retrospective research studies. 
Additional Products in Development 
Our rigorous discovery efforts have already enabled us to build unique technologies and develop a powerful platform for early detection. Moving forward, we will continue to research and develop technologies that have the potential to complement and enhance our capabilities. We have conducted early research and development in areas such as immunology and biofluids such as urine. We also plan to leverage relationships, including with academic and industry partners, to enable bringing potential new applications of our technology to market.

Clinical
Our Clinical Studies
We have built what we believe is one of the largest clinical programs in genomic medicine, which has generated what we believe is an unprecedented longitudinal dataset of high-quality, linked clinical and genomic data. We are collecting population-scale clinical data from more than 385,000 participants in numerous clinical studies, with more than 21,000 of these participants included in the studies that supported the development and launch of Galleri, and over 175,000 individuals enrolled and an additional approximately 50,000 anticipated to be enrolled in interventional studies (NHS-Galleri and PATHFINDER 2, which support our PMA submission, and the first-of-its kind Galleri-Medicare real-world study). The PATHFINDER 2 study and NHS-Galleri Trial are designed to support a PMA submission, with select inclusion criteria (matching the intended use population for Galleri), use of an appropriate assay (developed and commercially available), and enrollment of a sufficient number of participants to facilitate the generation of appropriate data and evidence. This design differs from our other studies, such as our CCGA study, which included participants outside of the intended use population for Galleri, and PATHFINDER study, which enrolled fewer participants and utilized an earlier version of Galleri for initial results. Additionally, we announced plans for a 100,000 individual real world study in the Medicare population, with a focus on racial and ethnic minorities and seniors aged 65 and above from under-served communities. The study seeks to compare up to 50,000 prospectively enrolled Medicare beneficiaries who have received usual care plus an annual Galleri test with a synthetic matched comparator arm of 50,000 beneficiaries who receive usual care alone, for up to three annual testing cycles. GRAIL is responsible for designing and executing this study and is planning to work with leading healthcare systems across the country and other key partners over the next few years. These foundational population-scale studies involve partnerships with numerous leading academic and cancer institutions and large community networks, including, among others, the Cleveland Clinic, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Guardian Research Network, Kettering Health, Mayo Clinic, Sutter Health, and the US Oncology Network. 
Our studies include the collection of blood and, as available and as directed by the protocol, tissue samples, demographic data, patient-reported outcomes data, and clinical data from participants. Clinical information, demographics, and medical data relevant to cancer status are collected from participants at time of enrollment and at regular intervals during a follow-up period. We integrate this information with the genomic data created from sequencing the samples and utilize these data to both train and validate our early cancer detection tests. Importantly, these are longitudinal studies and, in many cases, participant medical data will continue accruing for a number of years, facilitating analyses of longer-term outcomes, and further performance improvements of our products. Our studies are conducted by various medical and oncology centers around the country. 
We were the first to invest in and initiate multiple, large clinical validation studies for multi-cancer early detection. Results from PATHFINDER, our first completed return-of-results study, provided critical data to support launch of Galleri and understand how clinicians implement Galleri into care pathways in clinical practice. We have completed enrollment in six additional studies: PATHFINDER 2, NHS-Galleri, Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas (“CCGA”), SUMMIT, STRIVE, and SYMPLIFY. We are actively enrolling two studies: Galleri-Medicare (“REACH” or “Galleri-Medicare”) and REFLECTION. 
We have presented data and published results from our clinical studies in leading forums, including multiple major medical conferences, such as AACR, ASCO, and ESMO, and leading journals, such as 
The Lancet
,
 Nature
,
 Nature Medicine
,
 Cancer Cell
, and
 The Lancet Oncology
. Data from our studies is expected to support regulatory filings as we pursue PMA approval. 
Importantly, our clinical program was designed to enable test development for population scale screening, and enrollment was managed to enable diversity across multiple characteristics including in behaviors (such as smoking), non-cancer diseases, environmental exposures, age, gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and other confounding indications and differences. Understanding and cataloging this diversity has enabled us to develop tests with high-specificity, cancer signal detection across many cancer types, and accurate cancer signal origin prediction. Long-term follow-up in the studies we have launched in years past will continue to yield critical data that we believe can help define the standard of care in early cancer detection. 
Commercialization

Established Commercial Leadership in a Pre-Reimbursement Setting
We launched Galleri in the United States in mid-2021. As of December 31, 2024, we have sold more than 290,000 commercial tests, including more than 137,000 tests in 2024, and established a number of commercial partnerships, including leading healthcare systems, employers, payors, and life insurance providers. As of December 31, 2024, our commercial organization included approximately 250 personnel supporting our multi-channel strategy. We believe we currently have the largest share of the market for MCED testing, and we continue to build the key components of our commercial infrastructure and capabilities that are required to support rapid, population-scale testing in a post-reimbursement environment.
Our Commercial Strategy in the United States is Focused on Innovative Value-oriented Partnerships
Our strong commercial adoption is underpinned by our ability to demonstrate clinical utility and economic value even before obtaining broad reimbursement coverage. We are driving adoption in the following key channels:
Employers
. We target medium and large self-insured employers with compelling and innovative healthcare offerings that are designed to attract and retain employees and to deepen health equity among employees. Cancer treatment costs now represent the highest spend category for self-insured employers according to the most recent Business Group on Health’s 2023 Large Employers’ Health Care Strategy and Plan Design Survey. Galleri offers earlier cancer detection to help reduce these costs. Our employer customer base includes large tech companies, large life insurance companies, professional services companies, major health systems, and educational institutions, among others.
Physicians and Health Systems
. We believe Galleri is compelling to physicians whose patients are focused on preventive health and wellness as well as to concierge and executive health practices. The physician practices we are targeting are known to offer innovative, cutting-edge health offerings, and market research suggests patient’s expect innovative offerings from their primary care providers. We have evolved our sales strategy to target physicians in the most productive regions. We additionally partner with health systems, typically as part of a comprehensive screening program with patient and physician support services. We believe many of these health systems view Galleri as a key differentiating offering to patients. We have streamlined the implementation of Galleri for these partners, often connecting the health system’s electronic medical record system with our software systems. This bolsters our position as the partner of choice for establishing early cancer detection programs. Many health systems are investing in robust programs in population health management and precision medicine, of which Galleri is a key feature, and have developed novel care navigation pathways. With these novel pathways, a positive test result can result in patients being referred within the health system. We believe our experience with these partners will allow us to rapidly scale upon broad reimbursement for Galleri. 
Life insurance providers
. We have partnered with several leading life insurance providers to provide Galleri to their policyholders. Life insurers are committed to helping customers live longer, healthier, better lives and understand that preventative care and early detection are key to that mission. Galleri is offered by these providers as a preventative health benefit and is not used for underwriting, risk assessment or risk pooling.
Payors
. We have announced pilot or benefit programs with leading payors and continue to engage with other progressive payors. These programs allow for measurement of the clinical utility and economic value of Galleri. These payors include Medicare Advantage plans, which generally must cover all of the services that traditional Medicare covers, but they have the discretion to offer their enrollees additional or supplemental benefits. This also includes early-adopting commercial payors.
First Responders
. We have worked with clinics, fire departments, municipalities, and unions to make Galleri available to firefighters who generally have exposure-related increased risk of cancer and are actively screening their populations and seeking new approaches. 
Reimbursement Landscape for Screening Tests
United States
14
Table
 of 
Contents
Traditional fee-for-service Medicare generally does not cover screening tests, which are considered preventive services, that are performed in the absence of signs or symptoms of illness or injury, unless there is a statutory provision that explicitly authorizes coverage of the test. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 authorizes the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to cover additional preventive services that are not expressly covered by the statute if the service is (a) reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of an illness or disability, (b) recommended with a grade of A or B by the USPSTF, an independent, volunteer panel of experts in the field of prevention, evidence-based medicine and primary care, and (c) appropriate for Medicare beneficiaries under Part A or Part B. CMS establishes coverage through a national coverage determination (“NCD”) process. In its discretion, the USPSTF generally waits for FDA authorization before it considers undertaking reviews of novel technology.
Because MCED is not expressly authorized for coverage by the Medicare statute, one possible pathway for Medicare reimbursement is to first obtain FDA approval and then obtain a grade of A or B recommendation from USPSTF, to enable CMS to issue an NCD. The last cancer screening test to receive a recommendation from USPSTF with a grade A/B and obtain Medicare coverage was LDCT to screen high-risk smokers for lung cancer in 2015. Medicare coverage can also be changed by statute, thus a second possible pathway for Medicare reimbursement would be to amend the Medicare statute to cover MCED. This process would generally require new legislation to expressly authorize CMS to cover FDA-approved early cancer screening and detection tests. We are working with stakeholders to advance and shape the public reimbursement landscape to reflect that additional scope of coverage. Galleri is currently offered as an LDT in our CAP-accredited and CLIA-certified laboratory. We have a Breakthrough Device designation with the FDA and have begun the modular PMA submission process, which we expect to conclude with data from our ongoing pivotal studies. Under our Breakthrough Designation, interactions with the FDA have resulted in an anticipated timeline to submission, which we anticipate making in the first half of 2026. Nonetheless, the FDA requirements that will govern multi-cancer detection tests, as well as the breadth and nature of data we must provide the FDA, to support the proposed intended use, may be subject to change, and as such, it is difficult to predict what information we will need to submit to obtain approval of a PMA from the FDA for a proposed intended use. Following FDA approval and assuming a statutory change in the reimbursement landscape, we plan to pursue broad reimbursement, for example, through Medicare reimbursement, and subsequently pursue inclusion of Galleri in the USPSTF guideline recommendation.
United Kingdom—Commercial agreement with NHS
In November 2020, we established a partnership with NHS England. The NHS-Galleri Trial, which was undertaken as part of the partnership established by our commercial agreement with NHS England, is a large randomized controlled trial taking place across eight regions in England. The trial aims to assist with the United Kingdom’s ambitions for early cancer detection and to assess Galleri for potential population screening on a national scale. The primary objective of the trial is to assess whether implementation of Galleri can reduce the incidence of late-stage cancers through early cancer detection.
The NHS will evaluate the final results from the NHS-Galleri Trial, which are expected to be available in 2026, alongside other factors before determining whether to implement the Galleri test in the NHS. In the event that we proceed with commercial implementation following such results, we expect that our partnership with the NHS would be our first national system implementation. The NHS had previously evaluated results of an early analysis from the first screening test (the prevalent screening round) in the NHS-Galleri Trial to determine whether the results were compelling enough to commence an implementation pilot in England prior to the final trial results. The results of this early analysis represented limited information from only one year of results out of the three-year trial period, and final results from the full three-year period may differ from the early analysis for a variety of reasons. In May 2024, the NHS determined not to initiate the pilot on the basis of those available data. Given that the NHS has a reputation for high evidence standards for new technologies, we anticipate that NHS approval and implementation could expand adoption in the United Kingdom and could also help facilitate adoption in other single payor systems around the world. Our initial commercial version of the Galleri test is UKCA marked.
Other International
In December 2024, we launched the sale of Galleri in Israel using a distributor model. We intend to explore the launch of Galleri in select other international geographies, including through distributors.

Operations
Significant Investments for Scale
We have made significant investments for scale in our CAP-accredited and CLIA-certified laboratory facility in Durham, North Carolina and demonstrated execution with more than 600,000 clinical and commercial individual samples processed through December 31, 2024. We have an established footprint in the United States and United Kingdom, with operations in Durham, North Carolina, Washington, D.C., and London, United Kingdom.
In total we have approximately 46,000 square feet of CAP-accredited, CLIA-certified laboratory space with sufficient capacity to support multiple years of growth at our Durham facility. We have made significant investments to our Durham laboratory to improve the automation, including development of a fully automated laboratory testing platform consisting of robotic work cells connected by a central track system to increase efficiencies and reduce costs. Our lab operates 16 hours a day, seven days a week, and uses automation and other technology to reduce staff exposure to complicated, dangerous, repetitive, or injury-prone work. In 2024, we also launched an updated version of Galleri increasing the amount of laboratory automation, among other improvements. We believe that our current facilities are sufficient to meet our current and anticipated near-term needs.
Supply Chain and Agreements
Our supply chain includes industry leading vendors and we maintain significant supplies on hand of both laboratory consumables and other materials to avoid work stoppages and material delays. We rely on a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, sole suppliers, to provide certain materials for our products and services. For example, Illumina, Inc. is our sole supplier of sequencers and certain laboratory reagents, Madison (who acquired our blood collection tube manufacturer Streck, Inc. in 2023) is our sole supplier of tubes used for sample collection and Twist is the sole supplier of our DNA probes. We rely on standard commercial carriers for the delivery of samples to our laboratory.
Our supply strategy is to maintain raw material and released reagent supplies at levels that ensure our clinical laboratory can maintain continuous operations 365 days a year. We utilize a risk-based approach such that higher risk materials (e.g., sole-sourced or more vulnerable supply chains) have a higher safety stock and lower risk materials (e.g., multi-sourced) may have lower safety stock levels.
Our supply chain consists of commodity materials, multi-source, single-source or sole-source materials, services or equipment. We consider critical suppliers to be those that can impact the quality of GRAIL’s product and/or our quality management system, those with consistent high volume or spend and those who are key to a specific business function.
Mitigation around our supply chain risks is critical to our business and we enable strategies that look across risk pertaining to single or sole-source; supplier financial stability, scalability, business continuity; performance and delivery consistency; quality system adherence; information security; and contract or cost maturity. GRAIL seeks to secure long-term supply agreements and quality agreements where applicable and maintains raw material and released reagent supplies at levels that ensure our clinical laboratory can maintain continuous operations 365 days a year. We employ a safety stock strategy at the part level, ensuring our materials are available, balanced against their shelf life.
 GRAIL sole-source suppliers include Illumina, Inc. who is our sole supplier of sequencers and certain laboratory reagents, Madison, who acquired our blood collection tube manufacturer Streck, Inc. in 2023 and who is our sole supplier of tubes used for sample collection, and Twist who is the sole supplier of our DNA probes. We rely on standard commercial carriers for the delivery of samples to our laboratory. We have entered into supply agreements with various parties, including Illumina, Madison, and Twist. In January 2016, we entered into a supply and commercialization arrangement with Illumina, which agreement was amended and restated in February 2017 and subsequently further amended (“Illumina Supply Agreement”). Pursuant to the Illumina Supply Agreement, Illumina granted us non-exclusive rights to use certain Illumina know-how and technology with Illumina products purchased under the agreement. Under the terms of the Illumina Supply Agreement, regardless of whether our products incorporate any Illumina technology, we were obligated to pay Illumina a high single-digit

royalty, subject to certain reductions and floors, in perpetuity on net sales generated by our products or revenues otherwise generated or received by us, subject to certain exceptions, in the field of oncology. Pursuant to the fourth amendment to the Illumina Supply Agreement, the perpetual royalty payment obligation to Illumina is suspended until December 24, 2026 or any earlier change of control of GRAIL, at which time royalty payments to Illumina will resume, without retroactive effect. In addition, upon the execution of such amendment, we may elect to purchase instruments, supplies, and services from Illumina either pursuant to Illumina’s “Open Offer” universal pricing terms applicable to all of its for-profit oncology customers in the United States since March 2021, as updated, or the pricing terms we had prior to Illumina’s acquisition of us.

Industry Participants
There are other companies, such as Adela, Inc., Clearnote Health, DELFI Diagnostics, Inc., Exact Sciences Corporation, Exai Bio, Inc., Freenome Inc., Guardant Health, Inc., Harbinger Health and Natera, Inc. within the United States and AnchorDx, Anpac Bio-Medical Science Co., Ltd., Burning Rock Biotech Limited, Datar Cancer Genetics, Elypta AB, Gene Solutions JSC, Insighta, Mirxes, Singlera Genomics, Inc. and Seekin, Inc. outside of the United States, among others, that are attempting to develop tests to detect certain types of cancer early, including some that will use cfDNA analyses. A number of these companies, including Guardant Health, Inc., Exact Sciences Corporation, Natera, Inc. and Clearnote Health in the United States and, Insighta, Mirxes and Seekin, Inc. outside of the United States, have announced intentions to develop or launch multi-cancer early detection products. Some of these companies may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, such as larger research and development staff and well-established marketing and sales forces, or may operate in jurisdictions where lower standards of evidence are required to bring products to market. In addition, other established diagnostic, medical technology, biotechnology, or pharmaceutical companies may decide in the future to invest to accelerate discovery and development of similar tests. If any tests are developed by these companies and do not perform to expectations or cause harm or injury to patients, it may result in lower confidence in early cancer detection tests in general, which could potentially adversely affect confidence in our products and services.
Given the numerous and rigorous requirements for a successful cancer detection test, we do not believe many companies would have the financial resources to invest in population-scale clinical studies and rigorous analytics to compete with our products. Further, among companies pursuing an early-detection product, we believe we are substantially differentiated by our robust intellectual property portfolio, extensive research, rigorous and objective approach, and multidisciplinary capabilities, which leverage the power of NGS, population-scale clinical studies, and advanced and trained machine learning algorithms and data science. We believe we are further differentiated by the extent of our investment in our facilities and operational workflows, including our high-capacity laboratory, which we built for rapid, automatic processing of samples and to scale as we grow and process more tests.
Additionally, certain of our other products in development and our precision oncology offerings, could compete against a number of companies that are working to leverage blood-based technologies to improve cancer care. Many companies such as Roche/Foundation Medicine, Inc., Natera, Inc., Guardant, Inc., Tempus AI, Inc., Clearnote Health, NeoGenomics Laboratories, Personalis, Inc., Twist Bioscience Corp. and Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp., among others, currently provide or are developing technologies focused on improving cancer care after a diagnosis of cancer is made, including enabling selection of therapy, monitoring of therapy, or detection of relapsed disease. Unlike with respect to MCED testing, precision oncology is a very competitive space with many industry participants. However, as our precision oncology portfolio leverages our methylation platform, we believe we are differentiated by the extent of the quality of our methylation platform and our investments to develop such platform through our population-scale clinical studies, rigorous analytics and machine learning expertise.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and technology, including by seeking and maintaining patent protection, protecting our trade secrets and other proprietary information, obtaining and maintaining our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, and continually evaluating third-party technologies for further licensing opportunities. We also seek 
17

trademark protection where appropriate to protect the names that identify us as the source of our products and services.
We own certain patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property, and also exclusively license certain patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property from third parties, including the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Our patent portfolio broadly relates to methods, techniques, systems, and chemistry used to generate and analyze data using our proprietary bioinformatics and classifiers, including, for example, cfNA sequencing, marker panels, methylation signatures, bioinformatics techniques and biologically directed machine learning classifiers, which are incorporated into or used for Galleri, our precision oncology portfolio, and a diagnostic aid for cancer (“DAC”). We have also entered into certain supply and commercial agreements with various vendors and suppliers, including Illumina, under which we receive rights to their intellectual property for use in our products. Our material licenses and other agreements are described in more detail below.
As of December 31, 2024, we own or co-own more than 220 issued or granted patents and more than 620 pending patent applications globally, including 45 issued U.S. patents, 176 patents granted across Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Switzerland, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Europe, Finland, France, the United Kingdom, Greece, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Spain, Singapore, Slovenia, Slovakia, Türkiye and Taiwan, and more than 140 pending U.S. non-provisional and provisional patent applications.
We also have exclusive licenses to approximately 630 issued or granted patents and more than 190 pending patent applications globally, including 55 issued U.S. patents and 575 patents granted across Albania, Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Brazil, Canada, Switzerland, China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Eurasia, Europe, Estonia, Spain, Finland, France, the United Kingdom, Greece, Hong Kong, Croatia, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, India, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Monaco, North Macedonia, Macao, Malta, Mexico, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Sweden, Singapore, Slovenia, Slovakia, San Marino, Türkiye, Taiwan, and South Africa, and more than 35 pending U.S. non-provisional and provisional patent applications. We believe these patents cover, and that these patent applications upon grant will cover, various aspects of Galleri, our precision oncology portfolio and future products or improvements to existing products that we may develop.
Of particular importance within our sizeable patent portfolio are patents that relate to various aspects of Galleri and our precision oncology portfolio. For example:
•
with respect to methylation analysis, which is a foundational technology underlying our current products, we own or exclusively license 144 granted patents directed to systems, software, methods, mixtures, or kits for methylation analysis in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Switzerland, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Eurasia, Europe, Spain, Finland, France, the United Kingdom, Greece, Hong Kong, Croatia, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Singapore, Slovenia, Slovakia, Türkiye, Taiwan, the United States, and South Africa. These patents are expected to expire between 2033 and 2040, subject to our payment of applicable maintenance fees and annuities;
•
with respect to our technology for determining cancer type through identification of cancer signal of origin, we own or exclusively license 65 granted patents directed to systems, software, methods, or kits for determining cancer signal of origin in Austria, Australia, Belgium Switzerland, China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Europe, Spain, Finland, France, the United Kingdom, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Monaco, North Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Singapore, Slovenia, Türkiye, Taiwan, and the United States. These patents are expected to expire between 2033 and 2042, subject to our payment of applicable maintenance fees and annuities; and
•
with respect to our assay chemistry and techniques for preparing and optimizing patient samples for analysis, we own or exclusively license 37 granted patents directed to methods, assay panels, compositions, or software for assay chemistry and techniques in Belgium, Switzerland, China, Germany, Europe, France, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. These

patents are expected to expire between 2034 and 2042, subject to our payment of applicable maintenance fees and annuities.
Our patent portfolio also includes granted patents and pending patent applications directed to other technologies that may have varying levels of importance to our current and future products, including, for example:
•
systems, methods, kits, mixtures, and probes for sequencing, library preparation and enrichment (27 patent families with 81 granted patents and 53 pending applications; granted patents expected to expire between 2027 and 2042);
•
methods and nucleic acid constructs for error correction for identifying somatic variants (3 patent families with 54 granted patents and 15 pending applications; granted patents expected to expire between 2030 and 2040);
•
systems and methods for variant based assessment of cancer (12 patent families with 48 granted patents and 56 pending applications; granted patents expected to expire between 2033 and 2041);
•
systems, software, and methods for sequencing based assessment of copy number aberrations in cancer (9 patent families with 91 granted patents and 47 pending applications; granted patents expected to expire between 2028 and 2042);
•
systems, software, and methods for fragment length assessment in cancer detection (11 patent families with 119 granted patents and 92 pending applications; granted patents expected to expire between 2031 and 2040);
•
systems, software, methods, and compositions for fragmentation based assessment of cancer (9 patent families with 47 granted patents and 81 pending applications; granted patents expected to expire between 2030 and 2039); and
•
systems, software, and methods for viral based assessment of cancer (6 patent families with 24 granted patents and 54 pending applications; granted patents expected to expire between 2038 and 2040).
The expiration dates described above may not account for all potentially available patent term adjustments and are subject to our payment of applicable issue fees, maintenance fees and annuities. Patent expiration dates are estimates based on our calculations, taking into account terminal disclaimers and patent term adjustments. We continually assess and prioritize our patent portfolio based on its relevance to our business, while also pursuing new patent filings and grants, which may cause our total number of patents to change over time.
Our in-licensed patents and patent applications, if issued as patents, expire or would be expected to expire, at the earliest, in 2027, absent any potentially available patent term adjustment and assuming our timely payment of applicable issue fees, maintenance fees and annuities. We do not expect the scheduled expiration of patents in the near term to have a material impact on our business. Our owned or co-owned patents and patent applications, if issued as patents, expire or would be expected to expire, at the earliest, in 2037, absent any potentially available patent term adjustment and assuming our timely payment of applicable issue fees, maintenance fees and annuities. The term of these patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained, and in most countries in which we file, is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. A provisional patent application is not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of the filing date of the provisional patent application. If we do not timely file non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. In the United States, patent term adjustments may be available depending upon the time the United States Patent and Trademark Office takes to examine and eventually issue a patent, and the patent term may be shorter than 20 years if we disclaim a portion of the patent term to overcome double patenting rejections. The protection of patents may vary on a country-by-country and claim-by-claim basis, which can vary the scope of protection afforded by such patents. In addition, we must generally pay fees to maintain our patents annually or at other specified intervals, or risk the patent lapsing. We cannot provide any assurance that any of our current or future owned or licensed patent applications will result in the issuance of patents in any jurisdiction, or that any of 
19
Table

Contents
our current or future owned or licensed issued patents will effectively protect any of our products or technology or prevent others from commercializing competitive products or technology. Even if any of our current or future owned or licensed patent applications are granted as issued patents, those patents may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
We recently faced an opposition from anonymous challengers against one of our in-licensed European patents. The patent does not relate to aspects of Galleri or our precision oncology portfolio. The challengers asserted that this granted patent was invalid over prior art, among other arguments. The opposition concluded with the patent claims being maintained in amended form. The challengers have filed an appeal, which is currently pending. An additional opposition was filed on another of our in-licensed European patents relating to Galleri by an anonymous opponent, and this opposition is currently pending. While we believe that these patents are valid, there is a risk that these patents could be invalidated in their entirety, or certain claims of these patents could be amended and narrowed in scope.
License Agreements with the Chinese University of Hong Kong
We have entered into five license agreements with the Chinese University of Hong Kong, each on substantially similar terms and with two dated April 7, 2016 and three dated May 29, 2017. Pursuant to these agreements, the Chinese University of Hong Kong has granted exclusive, worldwide intellectual property licenses to us for the use of certain nucleic acid sequencing and analysis technologies in all fields under one license and in all fields except prenatal diagnostics, prognostications, or analysis under four licenses. The Chinese University of Hong Kong reserves the right to use its technology for internal research and education purposes and for fulfilling governmental contractual obligations (to the extent they exist). Three of the licenses are subject to certain non-exclusive license rights granted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong to a certain third party, solely for such third party’s internal research purposes in the field of cancer detection, cancer prognostication and other analysis for the screening and management of cancer.
To the extent our products use the licensed technology, such as our current Galleri and precision oncology products, we are required to pay the Chinese University of Hong Kong low single-digit percentage royalties on net sales of such products, subject to minimum annual guarantees, which began in 2018. In addition, for any sublicense of the licensed technology, we are obligated to pay the Chinese University of Hong Kong a specified portion of the revenue we receive from sublicensing. Our royalty and sublicense payment obligations with respect to each license for each product containing any licensed technology extends until the expiration or termination of such license, which shall be the later of a low double-digit number of years from our payment of the license issue fee or expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. We are additionally obligated to reimburse the Chinese University of Hong Kong for costs and expenses related to the filing, prosecution, maintenance, and defense of the licensed patents and patent applications.
Under these license agreements, we are obligated to use specified efforts to reach milestones relating to the development and sale of products that use the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s technology, and our failure to do so could result in termination of the license agreements. The Chinese University of Hong Kong may also terminate the agreements under certain other circumstances, such as our uncured material breach of the agreements or cessation of our business. We may terminate the agreements at any time at our convenience, provided we give the Chinese University of Hong Kong a certain period of notice. We can also terminate the agreements for the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s uncured material breach.
Trade Secrets
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Included in our trade secrets are the data from our genomics studies, various aspects of the operation of our laboratories, and various aspects of the algorithms used to process our data. Trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, contractors, and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology via unauthorized means, such as hacking by private or state actors. Although state and federal courts in the United States are generally willing to protect trade secrets, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.

Properties
Our principal office and laboratory is approximately 74,300 square feet and located at 1525 O’Brien Drive, Menlo Park, California. We amended the related lease in June 2017 to add approximately 57,400 square feet at 1605 Adams Drive, Menlo Park, California. Our lease expires in 2026 and we have an option to extend the lease for an additional five years.
In June 2020, we entered into an agreement to lease approximately 200,000 square feet of a building in Durham, North Carolina. Our lease expires in 2033 and we have three separate options to extend the lease, each for an additional five years.
We hold a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation Registration from the CMS and an accreditation from CAP for our laboratory in Durham, North Carolina. We also hold a Clinical Laboratory Certificate of Deemed Status from the State of California Department of Public Health. 
We believe that our facilities are sufficient to meet our current and anticipated near-term needs.
Human Capital
Since our founding, we have built an entrepreneurial culture, driven by our mission to detect cancer early, when it can be cured. This mission statement is an expression of our commitment to improve cancer care and drive better outcomes for patients with cancer. 
We recognize that our employees are key to our ability to achieve this mission and believe our employees have been and will continue to be a primary reason for our growth and success. Recognizing the importance of our human capital, our board of directors retains direct oversight of our human capital and oversees and reviews our culture, policies, and strategies related to human capital management, including recruitment, development, performance management, rewards and employee engagement. 
Employee Base
Our workforce consists of a highly skilled, diverse, and engaged team dedicated to the company’s mission and goals. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 1,000 full-time employees. The majority of our employees are based in the United States at our sites in Menlo Park, California, Durham, North Carolina, and Washington D.C. We also engage with contractors, vendors, and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
We are led by a multidisciplinary team with extensive experience across biotechnology, life sciences, public health, genomics, computer science, data science, biostatistics, clinical development, medical affairs, government and regulatory affairs, quality assurance, and laboratory and commercial operations. We believe this confluence of talent from multiple disciplines has enabled us to make significant progress in improving cancer care and will enable us to remain at the forefront of our industry.

Employees have access to a wide variety of online training programs, individual coaching programs for selected leaders, and mentoring programs. In addition, we offer leadership training through our LEAD program, which aims to build strong leaders who inspire our teams to achieve our corporate goals.
Government Regulations
We are subject to complex and frequently changing national, state, and local laws and regulations that govern various aspects of our business. In many jurisdictions, including the United States, the clinical laboratory and medical device industries must operate in accordance with extensive and complex legal standards, including laws and regulations related to certification, licensing, development, research, testing, manufacturing, laboratory operations, distribution, ordering and billing practices, advertising, promotion, marketing, sales and pricing practices, anti-markup practices, health information privacy and security, and consumer protection and unfair trade practices.
In the United States, the laws and regulations governing the marketing of diagnostic products are evolving, extremely complex, and in some instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. Clinical laboratory tests are regulated under CLIA, as well as by applicable state laws. In 
22
Table
 of 
Contents
addition, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”) defines a medical device to include any instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals. The tests we are developing and marketing are considered by the FDA to be subject to regulation as medical devices. Among other things, pursuant to the FDC Act and its implementing regulations, the FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, marketing and promotion, and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. The FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices are safe and effective for their intended uses, but the FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced certain applicable provisions of the FDC Act and regulations with respect to LDTs. However, the FDA recently issued a final rule amending the FDA's regulations to make explicit that in vitro diagnostic products (IVDs) are devices under the FDC Act, including when the manufacturer of the IVD is a laboratory, and phasing out its enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs. The final rule was effective as of July 5, 2024 and the phaseout policy is set to be implemented on May 6, 2025.
U.S. Regulation
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)
We are required to obtain and hold certain federal and state licenses, certificates, permits and accreditations to offer our products in the United States through our laboratory in Durham, North Carolina. In 1988, Congress passed CLIA, establishing rigorous quality standards for laboratories in the United States that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease or impairment of, or the assessment of the health of, human beings. Such testing may also include procedures to determine, measure, or otherwise describe the presence or absence of various substances or organisms in the body. CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with ongoing requirements intended to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of medical test results. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill federal and state healthcare programs, as well as many commercial third-party payors, for laboratory testing services. We hold a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation from the CMS and an accreditation from CAP for our Durham, North Carolina laboratory, and a Clinical Laboratory Certificate of Deemed Status from the State of California Department of Public Health. In order to obtain a CLIA certification, a laboratory must validate the test (ensure and document that the test provides accurate and reliable test results) and add the applicable specialty or subspecialty to the test menu. Before introducing and reporting patient results from an LDT, a laboratory is required to establish the specifications for a variety of performance characteristics, including accuracy, precision, analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity, reportable range, and reference interval. Such analytical validation is based on, among other things, the specific conditions, staff, and equipment of the particular laboratory.
Prior to offering a new test at our laboratories, we must also satisfy certain notification requirements to change our testing menu, such as notifications to regulatory and accrediting bodies, CMS, the California Department of Public Health Laboratory Field Services, and CAP. At their discretion, any of these entities may inspect our clinical laboratory at any time. In connection with a CLIA certification, laboratories are subject to routine survey and inspection every other year, as well as additional random or “for cause” inspections. Under CLIA, a survey is generally conducted every two years by CMS, a CMS agent (typically a state agency), or, if the laboratory holds a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation, a CMS-approved accreditation organization (for example, CAP). The routine biennial survey includes review of the laboratory’s analytical validation of any LDTs performed by the laboratory.
Penalties for non-compliance with CLIA requirements include a range of enforcement actions, including suspension, limitation or revocation of the laboratory’s CLIA certificate, as well as directed plan of correction, state on-site monitoring, civil monetary penalties, civil injunctive suit or criminal penalties.
CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications and obtain licenses, specify certain quality

control procedures and facility requirements, or prescribe record maintenance requirements. For more information on state licensing and other requirements, see “—State Licensing Laws.”
State Licensing Laws
In addition to the federal certification requirement for laboratories under CLIA, many states require licensure for laboratories under state law. For example, both California and North Carolina require laboratories to maintain in-state licenses to conduct testing in the state. In addition to in-state licensing requirements, certain states require licensing of out-of-state laboratories when specimens are collected or received from patients in such states. The state laboratory licensure requirements establish standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical laboratory, including the training and qualifications required of personnel, quality control, and proficiency testing. Moreover, certain states, such as New York, require state approval of certain tests, including certain tests that have not been cleared or approved by the FDA (such as LDTs), through a premarket submission containing, among other information, documentation relating to device analytical and clinical performance data. The New York State Department of Health also mandates proficiency testing for laboratories granted a permit under New York State law, regardless of whether or not such laboratories are located in New York. We have obtained New York State Department of Health Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program (NYSDOH CLEP) conditional approval for the updated commercial version of our Galleri launched in the fourth quarter of 2024. Clinical laboratory licensing laws in certain states, however, do not apply to laboratories operated for research purposes that do not return patient-specific results for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.
Non-compliance with state laboratory licensure requirements may cause the state agency to suspend, restrict, or revoke a license to operate the clinical laboratory, disapprove a licensure application, assess substantial civil money penalties, require onsite monitoring or impose specific corrective action plans. Certain statutory or regulatory noncompliance may also result in misdemeanor charges under state law. CLIA does not preempt state laws that have established laboratory quality standards that are at least as stringent as the federal law requirements under CLIA.
In addition to laboratory licensing, certain states, including California, impose registration and/or licensing requirements on companies that manufacture medical devices. These laws can apply to a manufacturer before its products are commercialized, including when a company is evaluating its product candidates in clinical trials. Violations of these laws may result in the denial, suspension, or revocation of the registration or license, as well as other fines and penalties, including imprisonment.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
In the United States, laboratory tests, such as Galleri, are subject to regulation by the FDA under the FDC Act and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, medical device development, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, premarket clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, export, import, and product sales and distribution.
Laboratory Developed Tests
Under the FDA’s regulatory framework, in vitro diagnostic devices (“IVDs”), such as Galleri, are a type of medical device, including tests that can be used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases, such as cancer, or other conditions. The FDA considers LDTs to be a subset of IVDs that are intended for clinical use and are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. Although the FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices, including IVDs, are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced certain applicable provisions of the FDC Act and regulations with respect to LDTs, with certain exceptions such as in the case of tests for public health emergencies or where the tests are offered directly to the consumer. Even under its current enforcement discretion policy, the FDA has issued warning letters to and safety communications about in vitro diagnostic device manufacturers for commercializing laboratory tests that were purported to be LDTs but that the FDA alleged failed to meet the definition of an LDT or otherwise were not subject to the FDA’s enforcement discretion policy.
24
Table
 of 
Contents
The FDA has for a number of years stated its intention to modify its enforcement discretion policy with respect to LDTs and impose applicable medical device requirements to LDTs more broadly. Most recently, the FDA proposed an amendment to its regulations in October 2023 that was finalized in May 2024, and became effective on July 5, 2024. This final rule clarifies the FDA’s historical view that LDTs are medical devices subject to the requirements applicable to other IVDs, and the FDA plans to phase in the enforcement of medical device requirements to LDTs over a period of four years.
In connection with the final rule, the FDA established certain new, targeted enforcement discretion policies, including, among others, for LDTs marketed as of the date of publication of the final rule (May 6, 2024), as well as for LDTs that have received approval from New York State’s Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program (“NY CLEP”). Specifically, the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion and not enforce certain medical device requirements (including the requirements for marketing authorization and compliance with certain elements of the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”)) with respect to LDTs that were marketed as of the date of the final rule’s publication, although such products must still comply with certain other FDA requirements, including registration and listing, portions of the QSR, medical device reporting, labeling, and corrections and removals reporting. However, where these tests are modified in certain ways from the version of the test marketed as of the final rule’s publication date, this enforcement discretion policy will no longer apply and the FDA intends to enforce all applicable FDA requirements (including premarket review and marketing authorization requirements) consistent with the phase-in policy. In addition, for LDTs that receive approval from NY CLEP, FDA intends not to enforce marketing authorization requirements when these requirements are phased in more generally at either three and a half or four years following the date of publication of the final rule. However, these tests will still be subject to the remaining medical device requirements, including registration and listing, medical device reporting, and quality system requirements, at the time that such requirements are phased in more generally.
In addition to the FDA’s final rule, Congress has, for over the past decade, considered a number of proposals, which if enacted, would subject LDTs to additional regulatory requirements. Depending on the approach adopted under any potential legislation, certain LDTs (likely those of higher risk) may be required to undergo some form of premarket review of LDTs as IVCTs, potentially with a transition period for compliance and a grandfathering provision.
PMA Pathway
The FDA categorizes medical devices into one of three classes—class I, II, or III—based on the risks presented by the device and the regulatory controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the QSR facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Special controls are established by the FDA for a specific device type and often include specific labeling provisions, performance metrics, and other types of controls that mitigate risks of the device (usually incorrect results for an IVD). While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or another legally marketed device that was cleared through the 510(k) process. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.
Class III devices generally require PMA approval before they can be marketed. Obtaining PMA approval requires the submission of “valid scientific evidence” to the FDA to support a finding of a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. A PMA must provide complete analytical and clinical performance data 
25
Table

Contents
and also information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDC Act to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. As part of the FDA’s review of a PMA, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with QSR requirements, which impose requirements related to design controls, manufacturing controls, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. The user fee costs and the length of the FDA review time for obtaining PMA approval are significantly higher than for a 510(k) notification or a de novo classification.
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
Investigational Device Exemption Process
. Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support PMA supplements. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”) regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting, and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin 
26
Table

Contents
the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping, and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
. The FDA has established programs to support and expedite the development of devices that meet criteria for Breakthrough Device designation, which can be voluntarily requested by sponsors. The program offers manufacturers of certain devices an opportunity to interact with the FDA more frequently and efficiently as they develop their products with the goal of expediting commercialization of such products to help patients have more timely access, as well as use of post-market data collection, when scientifically appropriate, to facilitate expedited and efficient development and review of the device, opportunities for efficient and flexible clinical study design, and priority review of premarket submissions. The program is available to medical devices that meet certain eligibility criteria, including that the device provides more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions, and constitutes a device (i) that represents a breakthrough technology, (ii) for which no approved or cleared alternatives exist, (iii) that offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives, or (iv) the availability of which is in the best interest of patients.
Postmarket Regulation
. After a device is cleared or approved by the FDA for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•
establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
•
QSR requirements, which currently require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•
labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products;
•
requirements related to promotional activities;
•
approval of certain modifications to PMA approved devices and their manufacturing processes;
•
medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•
correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act that may present a risk to health;
27
Table
 of 
Contents
•
complying with the laws and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database
•
the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
•
post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Device manufacturing processes subject to FDA oversight are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which currently cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation, and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. Manufacturers are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. A failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its approval or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
FDA Enforcement Powers
. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, including the following:
•
issuance of warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•
requesting or requiring recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
•
imposing operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•
refusing or delaying requests for marketing authorization of new products or modified products;
•
withdrawing marketing authorizations that have already been granted;
•
refusal to grant export approvals for our products; or
•
criminal prosecution.
Federal and State Physician Self-Referral Prohibitions
We are subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. The Stark Law generally prohibits us from billing, presenting, or causing to be presented a claim for any clinical laboratory services or other designated health services payable by the Medicare or Medicaid programs when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has an ownership interest in, or compensation arrangement with, us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition. The Stark Law contains several exceptions, including an exception for compensation paid to a physician for personal services rendered by the physician provided that several conditions are met, including that the payment is set at fair market value for the services furnished and the terms of the arrangement be set out in writing and signed by the parties. These prohibitions apply regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, and thus no finding of intent is required for a violation.
Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following:
•
denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition;
28
Table
 of 
Contents
•
refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law;
•
monetary penalties; and
•
exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
In addition, violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government.
Many states, including California, also have laws restricting physicians from referring persons for certain services to entities in which the referring physician has a financial interest, which may apply regardless of whether the payor for such claims is Medicare or Medicaid. For example, we are subject to the California Physician Ownership and Referral Act of 1993 (“PORA”). PORA, which applies regardless of payor type, generally prohibits physicians from referring individuals for certain services, including laboratory or diagnostic services, if the physician or his or her immediate family has a financial interest in the entity receiving the referral. PORA would generally prohibit us from billing an individual or any governmental or private payor for any laboratory or diagnostic services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has an investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, us, unless the arrangement falls under one of the statutory exceptions. Further, certain violations of PORA are a misdemeanor, and violations generally could result in civil penalties, criminal fines, and disciplinary action by the applicable governmental agency. Finally, other states have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply, which may differ from those imposed by federal and California law.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse
Our business operations, including any relationship we may form with physicians, healthcare providers or other potential customers or business partners, must comply with various healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a felony for a person or entity, including a laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit, or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any federal healthcare program, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The Anti-Kickback Statute contains certain statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain interactions if specific requirements are met. If an arrangement meets the provisions of a safe harbor, it is deemed not to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. An arrangement must fully comply with each element of an applicable safe harbor in order to qualify for protection. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor, however, does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued if the arrangement is determined by the government not to be abusive. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may result in imprisonment, fines and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. Actions that violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or any similar laws may also incur liability under the Federal False Claims Act.
Although the Anti-Kickback Statute applies only to federal healthcare programs, a number of states have passed statutes substantially similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. For example, California has enacted the PORA (see “—Federal and State Physician Self-Referral Prohibitions” above) and a Medi-Cal Anti-Kickback Statute, Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14107.2, that prohibit conduct similar to that prohibited by the Anti-Kickback Statute. Violations of PORA and Section 14107.2 are both punishable by imprisonment and fines. Many other states have all-payor statutes that extend the provisions of the state anti-kickback statute to not only governmental payors, but also private payors and self-pay patients.
Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce healthcare referrals or induce the purchase, prescribing or ordering of particular products or services. Law enforcement authorities and the courts have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose of any remuneration exchanged between healthcare providers and actual or 
29
Table

Contents
potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-Kickback Statute, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases. Investigation or challenge under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and analogous state laws of any relationship we may form with physicians, healthcare providers or other potential customers or business partners could lead to sanctions that could have a negative effect on our business.
In addition, other healthcare fraud and abuse laws could have an effect on our business. For example, in 2018, Congress enacted the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (“EKRA”), which establishes an all-payor anti-kickback prohibition for, among other things, knowingly and willfully paying or offering any remuneration directly or indirectly to induce a referral of an individual to a clinical laboratory. Violations of EKRA may result in fines, imprisonment, or both.
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties law prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare program beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by a federal healthcare program from a particular provider or supplier. Penalties for violating the Civil Monetary Penalties law may include exclusion from federal healthcare programs and substantial fines.
The Federal False Claims Act prohibits a person from knowingly submitting (or causing to be submitted) a claim, making a false record or statement in order to secure payment, or retaining an overpayment by the federal government. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party known as the “relator” who has knowledge of the alleged fraud. These types of actions are also known as qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. It is not uncommon for qui tam lawsuits to be filed by employees, third parties or consultants of healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories. Several states have also enacted similar false claims laws.
Further, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created two federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters, in addition to the privacy and security regulations described below under “—Privacy Regulation.” The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from government-sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.
Similar foreign laws and regulations may apply to us if we offer our products in foreign jurisdictions in the future.
While we intend fully to comply with applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws, and similar laws of other states and countries as we commercialize products, it is possible that some of our arrangements or arrangements we may enter into in the future could become subject to regulatory scrutiny, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be found to be in compliance with these laws following any such regulatory review.
Transparency Laws
The Sunshine Act was enacted by Congress in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) and was amended in 2018 by the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act. The Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS certain data on payments and other transfers of 
30

value made to U.S.-licensed physicians (as defined by statute), teaching hospitals, and certain non-physician practitioners, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse-midwives. The data are sent to CMS for public disclosure on the Open Payments.
Additional International Regulation and Product Approval
We may have to obtain or submit approvals, markings, notifications, certifications or satisfy other premarket requirements from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions prior to marketing our products in those countries and territories. The laws and regulations in other jurisdictions vary from those in the United States and may be easier or more difficult to satisfy, and they are subject to change, in some cases frequently. Certain regulatory authorities regulate LDTs and IVDs differently than the United States, and our products may need to satisfy additional requirements to be offered commercially within the jurisdictions.
Foreign Regulation
Medical devices (including IVDs) are subject to extensive regulation, such as premarket review, marketing authorization or certification, by similar agencies or notified bodies in other countries. Regulatory requirements and approval or certification processes are not harmonized and vary from one country to another. International regulators and notified bodies are independent and not bound by the findings of the FDA.
Regulation of In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices in the European Union
We are or may become subject to new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning medical devices proposed and enacted in various foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union (“EU”). The EU has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling, and adverse event reporting for IVDs. Until May 25, 2022, IVDs were regulated by Directive 98/79/EC (“EU IVDD”), which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/746 (“EU IVDR”). The EU IVDR became effective on May 26, 2022. However, to prevent disruption in the supply of IVDs on the EU market, “progressive” roll-out of the EU IVDR was adopted and subsequently extended following the adoption of several regulations. It provides for a tiered grace period for most devices depending on the risk classification of the device. Galleri currently benefits from the grace period applicable to Class C IVDs, and therefore must only be fully compliant with the EU IVDR requirements by December 31, 2028 subject to compliance with the transitional provisions. Galleri has been assessed in accordance with the EU IVDD whose regime is described below. However, as of May 26, 2022 and regardless of the tiered grace period, some of the EU IVDR requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the EU IVDD with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance and vigilance requirements. Pursuing marketing of IVDs in the EU will notably require that our devices be certified under the new regime set forth in the EU IVDR by the end of the transitional period at the latest.
In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 
Under the EU IVDD, an IVD may be placed on the market only if it conforms the essential requirements set out in the EU IVDD including the requirement that an IVD must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of IVDs and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended 
31

performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence.
In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation 
The regulatory landscape related to IVDs in the EU recently evolved. On April 5, 2017, the EU IVDR was adopted with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety. The EU IVDR establishes a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for IVDs and ensures a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Unlike the EU IVDD, the EU IVDR is directly applicable in EU member states without the need for member states to implement it into national law. This aims at increasing harmonization across the EU.
The EU IVDR became effective on May 26, 2022. IVDs lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU IVDD prior to May 26, 2022 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the EU IVDR, in particular the obligations described below.
All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (“FSCAs”) must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland, and also generally applicable in Türkiye.
Regulations Related to Clinical Laboratories in the European Union
The EU does not have an overarching law or regulation that governs the legal framework surrounding the operations of clinical laboratories in a way that would be analogous to CLIA in the United States. However, EU member states’ laws may affect how our business as a diagnostic testing service provider is carried out.
Other laws and guidelines that impact clinical laboratories’ work include the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine, the Declaration of Helsinki adopted by the World Medical Association and related codes of conduct and guidelines issued by the relevant research ethics committees.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
Regulation of In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices in the United Kingdom
Following Brexit, EU laws no longer apply directly in Great Britain. The regulations on IVDs in Great Britain continue to be based largely on the EU IVDD, which preceded the EU IVDR, as implemented into national law by the Medical Devices Regulation 2002 (“UK MDR”). However, under the terms of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, the EU IVDR does apply to Northern Ireland. Consequently, there are currently different regulations in place in Great Britain as compared to both Northern Ireland and the EU, respectively. The United Kingdom government has passed the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in favor of the Secretary of State or an “appropriate authority” to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human medicines, clinical trials and medical devices.
Since January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has become the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for Great Britain. All IVDs are required to be registered with the 
32
Table
 of 
Contents
MHRA, and since January 1, 2022, manufacturers based outside the UK have been required to appoint a UK responsible person that has a registered place of business in the UK to register devices with the MHRA.
Under the powers granted by the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, on December 16, 2024, the UK government published an amendment to the UK MDR to clarify and strengthen the post-market surveillance (PMS) requirements for medical devices in Great Britain. This amendment will come into force on June, 16 2025 and aims to facilitate greater traceability of incidents and trends enabling the MHRA to act swiftly when needed to address safety issues and support the entire health system in better protecting patients. In addition, the MHRA launched a consultation from November 14, 2024 to January 5, 2025 on proposed changes to the pre-market requirements for medical devices in Great Britain. The MHRA has stated that it will incorporate feedback to this consultation in drafting new UK legislation on pre-market requirements for medical devices in Great Britain. The new legislation is expected to be implemented in 2026 and aims to enable greater international collaboration and practices, with more patient-centered, proportionate requirements for medical devices which are responsive to technological advances.
Under the UK MDR, in order to be lawfully placed on the Great Britain market, class A (non-sterile) IVDs need to be “UKCA” self certified, and other IVDs need to be “UKCA” certified by a UK approved body. However, certain IVDs in compliance with either the EU IVDD or IVDR can continue to be placed on the Great Britain market until the sooner of certificate expiration or June 30, 2030.
Coverage and Reimbursement
We are pursuing payment for our products through a diverse and broad range of channels, including sales to self-insured employers, integrated health systems, healthcare providers, life insurance companies, and patients, as well as, where available, through coverage and reimbursement by government healthcare programs and commercial third-party payors.
United States
In the United States, there is no uniform coverage for clinical laboratory tests. The extent of coverage and rate of payment for covered services varies from payor to payor. Obtaining coverage for tests like ours that involve genomic sequencing can be particularly challenging.
Medicare is the single largest healthcare payor in the United States, and a particularly significant payor for many cancer-related laboratory services given the demographics of the Medicare population, a large portion of which includes elderly individuals. Many other U.S. payors look to the Medicare policies as a benchmark and model for their own. Medicare provides two main forms of insurance coverage: traditional Medicare fee-for-service, administered by the federal government and its contractors, and Medicare Advantage, where coverage is provided by private insurers approved by CMS that must follow federal rules and guidelines.
Generally, Medicare will not cover screening tests, which are considered preventive services, that are performed in the absence of signs or symptoms of illness or injury, except if explicitly authorized by statute. CMS, the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, authorizes certain additional preventive services including certain screening tests that are not expressly covered by statute if the service is (a) reasonable and necessary for the prevention or early detection of an illness or disability, (b) recommended with a grade of A or B by the USPSTF, an independent, volunteer panel of experts in the field of prevention, evidence-based medicine and primary care, and (c) appropriate for Medicare beneficiaries under Part A or Part B. CMS establishes coverage through an NCD process. In making the NCD determination, CMS may also consider, among other things, the relationship between predicted outcomes and expenditures for such services, and take into account the results of such an assessment in making such determination. In its discretion, the USPSTF generally waits for FDA authorization before it considers undertaking review of novel technology.
Galleri could be considered a screening test under Medicare and, accordingly, is unlikely to be covered by Medicare without pursuing the CMS NCD-related measures described above. These processes may take multiple years to complete as currently, coverage decisions for preventive services are not made prior to FDA authorization. Even if we pursue these processes, it is possible that Galleri will never become eligible for Medicare coverage and reimbursement. We are evaluating opportunities for nearer-term reimbursement through Medicare 
33

Advantage plans, while generating evidence to meet the requirements of the traditional Medicare path. Medicare Advantage plans generally must cover all of the services that traditional Medicare covers (except hospice care), but they have the discretion to offer their enrollees additional, or supplemental, benefits not otherwise covered under traditional Medicare, including those benefits referred to as optional supplemental benefits, for which enrollees may elect to pay extra to receive coverage. Obtaining such coverage may, however, involve lengthy negotiations with individual Medicare Advantage plans, and there is no guarantee that we will receive such coverage. We also intend to continue to pursue coverage and reimbursement from private payors for our products. Many of these private payors must cover certain services required by federal and state laws, such as preventive health services that have received a rating of A or B by the USPSTF. Like Medicare Advantage plans, private payors have discretion to extend greater coverage than recognized under traditional Medicare, but obtaining coverage from such payors generally involves lengthy negotiations, and there is no guarantee that we will receive such coverage. State Medicaid programs make individual coverage decisions for diagnostic tests and have taken steps to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, meaning that, even if Galleri receives coverage through private payors, there is no guarantee that it will be covered by individual state Medicaid programs.
If eligible for reimbursement, laboratory tests such as ours generally are classified for reimbursement purposes under CMS’s Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (“HCPCS”) and the American Medical Association’s (“AMA”) Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) coding systems. We and payors must use those coding systems to bill and pay for our diagnostic tests, respectively. These HCPCS and CPT codes are associated with the particular product or service that is provided to the individual. Accordingly, without an HCPCS or CPT code applicable to our tests, the submission and payment of claims would be a significant challenge. Once CMS creates an HCPCS code or the AMA establishes a CPT code, CMS establishes payment rates and coverage rules under traditional Medicare, and private payors establish rates and coverage rules independently. Under Medicare, payment for laboratory tests is generally made under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”) with payment amounts assigned to specific HCPCS and CPT codes.
In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”), which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services are paid under Medicare. Under PAMA (as amended by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020), laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the CLFS and Physician Fee Schedule and receive at least $12,500 in Medicare revenues for CLFS services during a data collection period are subject to certain reporting requirements. CMS uses the data reported, which includes certain private payor payment rates for each test the laboratory performs, the volume of tests paid at each rate, and the HCPCS code associated with the test, to calculate a weighted median payment rate for each test, which is used to establish revised Medicare CLFS reimbursement rates for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (“CDLTs”). If the test is an advanced diagnostic laboratory test (“ADLT”), the test will be paid based on an actual list charge for an initial period of three quarters before being shifted to the weighted median private payor rate reported by the laboratory performing the ADLT. Laboratories offering ADLTs are subject to recoupment if the actual list charge exceeds the weighted median private payor rate by a certain amount. Accordingly, if our tests receive Medicare coverage in the future, the reimbursement rate we receive for such tests may be affected by payment rates made by private payors for such tests.
The revised reimbursement methodology described above generally results in relatively lower reimbursement amounts under Medicare for clinical laboratory services than has been historically reimbursed. Any reductions to reimbursement rates resulting from the new methodology are limited to 0% in 2023 and 15% per test per year in each of 2024 through 2026.
In addition, PAMA codified Medicare coverage rules for laboratory tests by requiring any local coverage determination to be made following the local coverage determination process. PAMA also authorizes CMS to consolidate coverage policies for clinical laboratory tests among one to four laboratory-specific MACs. These same contractors may also be designated to process claims if CMS determines that such a model is appropriate. It is unclear whether CMS will proceed with contractor consolidation under this authorization.
General Coverage and Reimbursement Considerations

Across jurisdictions, a decision to provide coverage for a product from a government payor, such as Medicare, or other third-party payor does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, coverage and reimbursement for products, and services that utilize such products, can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance or at all.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, including clinical laboratory tests, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In certain foreign markets, the government controls the coverage and pricing of many healthcare products, including IVDs and clinical laboratory tests. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be cleared or approved by regulators for sale (or certified by a notified body), or for any procedure that utilizes such product, it may be necessary to conduct health economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the products. The cost of such studies would be in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals or certifications. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available products, they may not cover the product after approval (or certification) as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. Tests such as ours that will cover a large population and could potentially generate a significant number of false-positive results on an absolute basis may face incremental scrutiny in obtaining reimbursement from third-party payors given the additional costs of further diagnostic workup.
The marketability of Galleri may suffer if government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on medical products and services pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for our tests, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our products, decrease our revenue and adversely impact sales of, and pricing of and reimbursement for, our products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments, and fraud and abuse changes.
The implementation of the ACA in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The ACA included, among other things, provisions governing enrollment in federal and state healthcare programs, reimbursement matters, and fraud and abuse. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, U.S. Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures, if any, will impact our business.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, resulted in reductions in payments to Medicare providers, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced CMS payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover Medicare overpayments to providers from three to five years.

In the EU, on December 13, 2021, Regulation No 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment (“HTA”) amending Directive 2011/24/EU, was adopted. The Regulation entered into force in January 2022 and has been applicable since January 2025, with phased implementation based on the type of product (i.e., certain high-risk medical devices as of 2026). The Regulation intends to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including certain high-risk medical devices and provides the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. It will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the highest potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement.
We believe that there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels and in foreign jurisdictions, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our products. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenue and impact sales of and reimbursement for our products.
Data Privacy and Security Regulation
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.

The Spin-Off
Illumina acquired the common stock of GRAIL that it did not own and completed its acquisition of GRAIL on August 18, 2021 (the “Acquisition”). The Acquisition was subject to various legal challenges, including by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. These proceedings spanned more than three years and resulted in several orders, including hold-separate arrangements imposed by the European Commission. Following the European Commission’s decision on October 12, 2023 ordering Illumina to divest GRAIL, Illumina completed the divestiture via a Spin-Off on June 24, 2024 (the “Distribution Date”).
Immediately prior to the Distribution Date, GRAIL, LLC was converted into a Delaware corporation and renamed GRAIL, Inc. To effect the Spin-Off, Illumina distributed 85.5% of the shares of GRAIL’s common stock owned by Illumina to Illumina’s stockholders, and GRAIL became an independent, publicly traded company. Illumina retained 14.5% of GRAIL’s common stock. Also on the Distribution Date, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and several other agreements with Illumina related to the Spin-Off. These agreements govern the relationship between Illumina and us after completion of the Spin-Off and allocated between Illumina and us various assets, liabilities and obligations, including those related to employees and compensation and benefits plans and programs and tax-related assets and liabilities.
