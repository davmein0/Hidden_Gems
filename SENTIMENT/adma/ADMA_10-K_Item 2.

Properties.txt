* Pursuant to a shared services agreement, as amended, with Areth, LLC ("Areth") for office, warehouse space and related services pursuant to which the Company pays Areth monthly lease payments of $10,000. Areth is a
        company controlled by Dr. Jerrold B. Grossman, our Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Adam S. Grossman, our President and Chief Executive Officer.

We also have ten plasma collection centers in leased facilities mainly in the southeastern part of the U.S., which require lease payments through the respective lease terms that expire at various dates through 2033
        (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report).

We believe that our leased and owned properties are adequate to meet our current and future needs.
