Risk Factors

Summary of Risk Factors

Below is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional
                    discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading “Risk Factors” and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Form 10-K and
                    our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock.

•

Although we achieved net income on a GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2024 for the first time, we may not be able to maintain profitability and continue to generate positive cashflows in the future.

•

We contract with third parties for the filling, packaging, testing and labeling of the drug substance we manufacture, and we also obtain source plasma from certain third parties. This reliance on third parties carries the
                            risk that the services and raw materials upon which we rely may not be performed in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or according to our specifications, which could delay the availability of our finished drug product
                            and could adversely affect our commercialization efforts and our revenues.

•

The estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market and revenue growth included in our filings may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, our business could
                            fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.

•

Both of our business segments and our facilities, as well as our suppliers and contractors, are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, which, depending on the outcome of such inspections,
                            could result in certain regulatory actions, including the issuance of observations, notices, citations, warning letters or other enforcement actions.

•

Business interruptions could adversely affect our business.

•

Although we have received approval from the FDA to market ASCENIV as a treatment for PIDD, our ability to market or seek approval for ASCENIV for alternative indications could be limited unless additional clinical trials are
                            conducted successfully and the FDA approves a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) or other required submission for review.

•

With the approval of ASCENIV, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in further developing and expanding commercial operations, collecting and procuring an adequate supply of high-titer antibody RSV plasma or
                            balancing our research and development activities with our commercialization activities.

•

We depend on third-party researchers, developers and vendors to develop, manufacture, supply materials for or test our products and product candidates, as well as for other pre-and post-approval services, and such parties’
                            performance is, to some extent, outside of our control.

•

We may be unable to successfully expand our manufacturing processes to fulfill demand for our products or increase our production capabilities through the addition of new equipment, including if we do not obtain requisite
                            approval from the FDA.

•

Our products, and any additional products for which we may obtain marketing approval in the future, could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we could be subject to substantial
                            penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products following approval.

•

Historically, a few customers have accounted for a significant amount of our total revenue and accounts receivable and the loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
                            operations and financial condition.

•

Issues with product quality and compliance could have a material adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.

•

If physicians, payers and patients do not accept and use our current products or our future product candidates, our ability to generate revenue from these products will be materially impaired.

•

Our accruals for U.S. Medicaid rebates and other liabilities related to the sale of our immunoglobulin products are estimates based on historical experience and other assumptions. These estimates are subject to change based
                            on actual results and other factors. Any such change could have a material effect on our business, financial position and operating results.

•

Our long-term success may depend on our ability to supplement our existing product portfolio through new product development or the in-license or acquisition of other new products, product candidates and label expansion of
                            existing products, and if our business development efforts are not successful, our ability to maintain profitability may be adversely impacted.

•

Our ADMA BioCenters operations collect information from donors in the United States that subjects us to consumer and health privacy laws, which could create enforcement and litigation exposure if we fail to meet their
                            requirements.

•

Our senior secured credit facility with Ares Capital Corporation and certain of its affiliates (“Ares”) is subject to acceleration in specified circumstances, which may result in Ares taking possession and disposing of any
                            collateral.

•

If we are unable to protect our patents, trade secrets or other proprietary rights, if our patents are challenged or if our provisional patent applications do not get approved, our competitiveness and business prospects may
                            be materially damaged.

•

Cyberattacks and other security breaches could compromise our proprietary and confidential information or otherwise penetrate our network, which could harm our business and reputation.

•

Our ability to continue to produce safe and effective products depends on the safety of our plasma supply, testing by third parties and the timing of receiving the testing results, and the manufacturing processes we have in
                            place to counter transmittable diseases.

•

We could become supply-constrained and our financial performance would suffer if we cannot obtain adequate quantities of FDA-approved source and high-titer plasma with proper specifications or other necessary raw materials.

•

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) may be limited.

•

Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate and realization of our net deferred tax assets may result in volatility of our operating results and materially impact our financial condition or financial results.

•

The market price of our common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.

Risk Factors

Described below are various risks and uncertainties that may affect our business. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. You should recognize that other significant
                    risks and uncertainties may arise in the future, which we cannot foresee at this time. Also, the risks that we now foresee might affect us to a greater or different degree than expected. Certain risks and uncertainties, including ones
                    that we currently deem immaterial or that are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also affect our business. If any of the risks described below actually occur, our business, financial
                    condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and the section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” before you decide to
                    invest in our securities.

Risks Relating to our Business

Although we achieved net income on a GAAP basis for the year ended December 31, 2024 for the first time, we may not be able to maintain profitability  andcontinue to
                    generate positive cash flows in the future.

We have a history of losses through December 31, 2023, and we may not be able to maintain profitability. Although we achieved net income of $197.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, for the years
                    ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred net losses of $28.2 million and $65.9 million, respectively. From our inception in 2004 through December 31, 2024, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $308.6 million. We may not be
                    able to maintain profitability in 2025 or beyond, and if we are unable to continue to consistently achieve positive cash flows we may need to finance our operations through additional equity or debt financings or corporate collaboration
                    and licensing agreements. If, in the future, our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance, analyst estimates or the expectations of investors, or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, our
                    stock price may decline. Any sustained or increased profitability or financial performance may contribute to increased scrutiny from the investment community and applicable federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities and
                    government bodies. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that as our business continues to grow our operating expenses will increase accordingly as we:

•

expand commercialization and marketing efforts;

•

expand our research and development programs;

•

implement additional internal systems, controls and infrastructure;

•

hire additional personnel; and

•

expand production capacity at the Boca Facility.

As a result, we will need to continue to generate significant revenues in order to maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or maintain profitability in the future.

Pandemics, or a resurgence of a pandemic, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted certain aspects of our business and operations. The resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, or a future pandemic or health epidemic, could adversely affect our
                      business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. These adverse effects include, but are not limited to, the potential adverse effects on the global economy, our manufacturing processes, including our supply chain,
                      our submissions or applications to the FDA and our employees. The ultimate impact will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response, each of
                      which is unforeseeable and difficult to predict.

We contract with third parties for a portion of the filling, packaging, testing and labeling of the drug substance we manufacture, and also obtain plasma from certain
                    third parties. This reliance on third parties carries the risk that the services and raw materials upon which we rely may not be performed in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or according to our specifications, which could
                    delay the availability of our finished drug product and could adversely affect our commercialization efforts and our revenues.

Third parties may not perform as agreed or in accordance with FDA requirements. Any significant problem that our third-party providers experience could delay or interrupt our supply of finished drug product
                    until the service provider cures the problem or until we locate, negotiate for, validate and receive FDA approval for an alternative provider (when necessary), if one is available. Failure to obtain the needed services, raw materials
                    and products meeting the necessary quality standards or at all could have a material and adverse effect on our products, business, financial condition and results from operations.

Although we are utilizing our FDA-approved fill/finish suite that we built at the Boca Facility for a portion of our finished drug product and although we receive our raw material plasma from our ADMA
                    BioCenters plasma collection facilities, we also intend to continue to utilize third parties to supplement our fill/finish process for final drug product and to supply raw material source and high-titer RSV plasma. Any failure by us,
                    our contract fill/finishers, or other third parties involved in the process for producing our products or product candidates to comply with the applicable manufacturing and regulatory requirements, including quality requirements, could
                    place us and them at risk of regulatory enforcement actions, recalls and other adverse consequences, could adversely impact our products, and could adversely impact patients receiving our products, which may negatively impact our
                    business and our ability to produce and supply products to meet commercial and clinical needs.

Our anticipated reliance on a limited number of third-party contractors exposes us to the following risks:

•

we may be unable to identify contractors on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential service providers is limited and the FDA must inspect and qualify any contract manufacturers for current cGMP compliance
                              as part of our marketing application;

•

a new fill/finisher would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, the production of our products and product candidates;

•

a pandemic, or the resurgence of a pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or a cyberattack or data breach, could adversely affect our contractors’ operations, supply chain or workforce;

•

our contracted fill/finishers’ resources and level of expertise with plasma-derived biologics may be limited, therefore they may require a significant amount of support from us in order to implement and maintain the
                              infrastructure and processes required to deliver our finished drug product;

•

our third-party contractors might be unable to timely provide finished drug product or raw material plasma in sufficient quantity or in accordance with our specifications to meet our commercial needs;

•

contractors may not be able to execute our inspection procedures and required tests appropriately;

36

Table of Contents

•

contractors are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other government regulations, and we do not have control over
                              third-party providers’ compliance with these regulations;

•

contractors may fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, placing them and us at risk of regulatory enforcement actions, recalls and other adverse consequences, and which place our patients at risk, which may
                              negatively impact our business and their ability to supply products to meet our development, clinical and commercial needs;

•

our third parties could breach or terminate their agreements with us; and

•

our contract fill/finishers may have unacceptable or inconsistent drug product quality success rates and yields, and we have no direct control over our contract fill/finishers’ ability to maintain adequate quality control,
                              quality assurance and qualified personnel.

Each of these risks could delay or prevent production, the completion of our finished drug product and the release of finished drug product by us or the FDA, which could result in higher costs or adversely
                    impact our revenues. These risks could also result in the delay in obtaining clinical supplies, which would delay our development programs. In addition, our contract fill/finishers and our other third-party vendors may source their
                    materials and supplies globally and are therefore subject to supply disruptions in the event of fire, weather related events such as hurricanes, wind and rain, international conflicts, strikes, embargoes, trade and sanction requirements
                    and limits, other acts of God or force majeure events or global health occurrences and emergencies.

The estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market and revenue growth included in our filings may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we
                    compete achieve the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.

Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. In particular, the size and growth of
                    the overall U.S. IVIG and source plasma markets and the potential market opportunity for an
 S. pneumoniae
 hyperimmune globulin are subject to significant variables that can be difficult to
                    measure, estimate or quantify. Additionally, we anticipate receiving FDA approval by mid-2025 for the PAS for our innovative yield enhancement production process, which has demonstrated an ability to increase production yields by
                    approximately 20% from the same starting plasma volume, potentially driving significant increases to financial targets beginning in the second half of 2025, if approved. Although our financial targets for 2025 and 2026 described in Part
                    1,
