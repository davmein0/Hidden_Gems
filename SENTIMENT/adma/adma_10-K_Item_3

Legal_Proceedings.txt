Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form
        10-K. The various sections of this discussion contain a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be materially affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this Annual
        Report.  See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”  Our actual results may differ materially.

OVERVIEW

Our Business

ADMA Biologics, Inc. (the “Company,” “ADMA,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is an end-to-end commercial biopharmaceutical company dedicated to manufacturing, marketing and developing specialty biologics for the treatment of
        immunodeficient patients at risk for infection and others at risk for certain infectious diseases. Our targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disorder or who may be
        immune-suppressed for medical reasons.

Through our ADMA BioManufacturing business segment, we currently have three products with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approval, all of which are currently marketed and commercially available: (i)
        ASCENIV (Immune Globulin Intravenous, Human – slra 10% Liquid), an Intravenous Immune Globulin (“IVIG”)  product indicated for the treatment of Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency (“PI”), also known as Primary Immunodeficiency Disease (“PIDD”) or
        Inborn Errors of immunity in adults and adolescents, for which we received FDA approval on April 1, 2019 and commenced first commercial sales in October 2019; (ii) BIVIGAM (Immune Globulin Intravenous, Human), an IVIG product indicated for the
        treatment of PI, and for which we received FDA approval on May 9, 2019 and commenced commercial sales in August 2019;  and (iii) Nabi-HB (Hepatitis B Immune Globulin, Human), which is indicated for the treatment of acute exposure to blood
        containing HBsAg and other listed exposures to Hepatitis B. We seek to develop a pipeline of plasma-derived therapeutics, including a product based on our most recently approved patent application under U.S. Patent Nos. 10,259,865 and 11,084,870
        related to methods of treatment and prevention of 
S. pneumonia
 infection for an immunoglobulin manufactured to contain standardized antibodies to numerous serotypes of 
S.
          pneumoniae
. We have successfully completed production of a pilot-scale batch and are conducting animal studies for our
 S. pneumoniae
 hyperimmune globulin program, SG-001. Our products and product
        candidates are intended to be used by physician specialists focused on caring for immune-compromised patients with or at risk for certain infectious diseases.

We manufacture these products at our FDA-licensed, plasma fractionation and purification facility located in Boca Raton, Florida with a peak annual processing capability of up to 600,000 liters (the “Boca Facility”).
        Based on current production yields, our completed and ongoing supply chain enhancements and capacity expansion initiatives, we believe this facility has the potential to produce sufficient quantities of our immune globulin (“IG”) products
        representing projected annual revenues greater than $490 million in 2025 and $605 million in 2026. These revenue targets translate to potential fiscal year 2025 and 2026 Adjusted Net Income exceeding $175 million and $235 million, respectively, and
        Adjusted EBITDA exceeding $225 million and $305 million, respectively. The foregoing financial targets do not account for the potential FDA approval of our innovative yield enhancement production process described below.

In December 2024, we successfully submitted a 
Prior Approval Supplement (the “PAS”)
 for potential approval of our innovative yield enhancement production process. Following FDA
        review of the submission, we anticipate receiving FDA approval by mid-2025, with potential revenue and earnings accretion expected in the second half of the year. This innovative process has demonstrated an ability to increase production yields by
        approximately 20% from the same starting plasma volume, potentially driving significant increases to financial targets, if approved.

Through our ADMA BioCenters subsidiary, we currently operate ten source plasma collection facilities in the U.S., all of which hold FDA licenses. This business unit, which we refer to as our Plasma Collection Centers
        business segment, provides us with the blood plasma required for the manufacture of our products, and also allows us to sell certain quantities of source and hyperimmune plasma to third-party customers for further manufacturing. In addition, three
        of our FDA-approved plasma collection centers also have approvals from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (“MFDS”), as well as FDA approval to operate a Hepatitis B immunization program. A typical plasma collection center, such as those
        operated by ADMA BioCenters, can collect approximately 30,000 to 50,000 liters of source plasma annually, which may be sold for different prices depending upon the type of plasma, quantity of purchase and market conditions at the time of sale.
        Plasma collected from ADMA BioCenters’ facilities that is not used to manufacture our products is sold to third-party customers in the U.S. and in other locations outside the U.S. where we are approved under supply agreements or in the open “spot”
        market.

From time to time we may provide contract manufacturing services for certain third-party clients. We also provide laboratory contracting services to certain customers and may provide contract filling, labeling and
        packing services utilizing our FDA-approved in-house fill-finish capabilities.

For the year ended December 31, 2024 we achieved net income of $197.7 million, the first time in our history that we achieved net income on a GAAP basis, and generated positive cash flow from operations of $118.7
        million. Our improved operating results are primarily the result of the substantial revenue growth and continued physician, patient and payer acceptance of ASCENIV.

Our Products

ASCENIV

ASCENIV is a plasma-derived IVIG that contains naturally occurring polyclonal antibodies, which are proteins that are used by the body’s immune system to neutralize microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, and prevent
        against infection and disease. We manufacture ASCENIV under HHS License No. 2019 using a process known as fractionation. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has issued a permanent, product-specific-J-code for ASCENIV.  Under the
        Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (“HCPCS”), the J-code (J1554) became effective April 1, 2021. As part of our proprietary manufacturing process for ASCENIV, we leverage our unique, patented plasma donor screening methodology and tailored
        plasma pooling design, which blends normal source plasma and plasma from donors tested to have high levels of neutralizing antibody titers to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (“RSV”) using our proprietary microneutralization testing assay. With our
        patented testing methods and assay, we are able to identify the high-titer or “hyperimmune” plasma that meets our internal and required specifications for ASCENIV. This type of high-titer plasma is typically found in less than 10% of the total
        donor collection samples we test.

ASCENIV is approved for the treatment of PIDD or PI, a class of inherited genetic disorders that causes a deficient or absent immune system in adults and adolescents (12 to 17 years of
          age). Our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in 59 PIDD patients met the primary endpoint of no Serious Bacterial Infections (“SBI”) reported during 12 months of treatment. Secondary efficacy endpoints further demonstrated the benefits of ASCENIV in
          the low incidence of infection, therapeutic antibiotic use, days missed from work, school and daycare and unscheduled medical visits and hospitalizations. We believe this clinical data together with the FDA approval for the treatment of PIDD
          better positions ADMA to potentially further evaluate ASCENIV in immune-compromised patients infected with or at-risk for RSV infection or potentially other respiratory viral pathogens at an appropriate time. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our
          plans have been delayed.  In the future however, we may elect to work with the FDA and the immunology and infectious disease community to design an appropriate clinical trial to evaluate the use of ASCENIV in this patient population. Following
          FDA approval in April 2019, commercial sales of ASCENIV commenced in October of 2019 and in
 2023 we commenced manufacturing ASCENIV at the 4,400 Liter production scale. This expansion has improved the product’s margin profile and increased
        plant production capacity as fewer batches are needed to support our revenue goals
. 
ASCENIV’s prescriber and patient base continued to expand during 2024, which drove record utilization and pull-through for
        this product. These elevated demand trends have sustained into 2025, and ADMA currently expects that this product’s rapid growth will continue throughout 2025 and beyond.

We anticipate filing our supplemental Biologics License Application (“sBLA”) in mid-2025, with potential FDA approval in the first half of 2026 for the expansion of ASCENIV’s label to include the pediatric setting for
        patients who are two years and older.

BIVIGAM

BIVIGAM is a plasma-derived IVIG that contains a broad range of antibodies similar to those found in normal human plasma. These antibodies are directed against bacteria and viruses and help to protect PI patients
        against serious infections. BIVIGAM is a purified, sterile, ready-to-use preparation of concentrated human Immunoglobulin G antibodies indicated for the treatment of PI, a group of genetic disorders. This includes, but is not limited to, the
        humoral immune defect in common variable immunodeficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, congenital agammaglobulinemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and severe combined immunodeficiency. These PIs are a group of genetic disorders. Based on recent
        estimates, these disorders are no longer considered to be very rare, with as many as one in every 1,200 people in the United States having some form of PI.

On May 9, 2019, the FDA approved the Prior Approval Supplement (the “PAS”) for the use of our IVIG manufacturing process, thereby enabling us to re-launch and commercialize this product in the U.S. We resumed
        production of BIVIGAM during the fourth quarter of 2017 and commercial production is ongoing, using our FDA-approved IVIG manufacturing process under U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) License No. 2019. The commercial re-launch
        and first commercial sales for this product commenced in August of 2019.

On April 28, 2021, we announced that the FDA granted approval for our expanded plasma pool production scale process, allowing for a 4,400-liter plasma pool for the manufacture of our BIVIGAM IVIG product. This
        increased IVIG plasma pool scale, which allows us to produce BIVIGAM at an expanded capacity utilizing the same equipment, release testing assays and labor force, has had a favorable impact on our gross margins, manufacturing efficiencies and
        operating results.

On December 12, 2023, we announced that the FDA approved the expansion of BIVIGAM’s label in the U.S. to now include the pediatric setting for those two years of age and older.

Nabi-HB

Nabi-HB is a hyperimmune globulin that is rich in antibodies to the Hepatitis B virus. Nabi-HB is a purified human polyclonal antibody product collected from plasma donors who have been previously vaccinated with a
        Hepatitis B vaccine. Nabi-HB is indicated for the treatment of acute exposure to blood containing HBsAg, prenatal exposure of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers, sexual exposure to HBsAg-positive persons and household exposure to persons with
        acute Hepatitis B virus infection in specific, listed settings. Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus, which is a major global health problem. The Hepatitis B virus can cause chronic infection
        and places people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Nabi-HB has a well-documented record of long-term safety and effectiveness since its initial market introduction. The FDA approved Nabi-HB on March 24, 1999.  Production of
        Nabi-HB at the Boca Facility has continued under our leadership since the third quarter of 2017. In early 2018, we received authorization from the FDA for the release of our first commercial batch of Nabi-HB for commercial distribution in the U.S.
        and we continue to manufacture Nabi-HB under HHS License No. 2019.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
        accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
        expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and assumptions, including those described below. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
        circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these
        estimates.

70

Table of Contents

Some of the estimates and assumptions we have to make under U.S. GAAP require very difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, we have identified those
        as critical accounting estimates, which are considered critical to an understanding of our historical financial condition and results of operations and are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our future results of operations and
        financial condition. Critical accounting estimates include rebates and potentially certain other deductions from gross revenues, assumptions used in the fair value of awards granted under our equity incentive plans and estimates related to the
        valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets. For a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Deductions for Rebates and Chargebacks

Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions which are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. These deductions primarily consist of rebates, distribution fees,
        chargebacks and sales allowances. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations, some of which are contractual in nature and do not require extensive judgment to be exercised by management, while other estimates require complex or
        subjective matters of knowledge and judgment when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on net revenues for a reporting period.

Prior to 2024, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations have not been material to our overall business. While we have some historical sales and rebate experience from our two
        primary immunoglobulin products, ASCENIV and BIVIGAM, since their FDA approvals in 2019, our historical experience is not extensive. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of
        our future experience, our results could be materially affected. Estimates that are most at risk for material adjustment are those associated with U.S. Medicaid rebates because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual and
        its ultimate settlement, an interval that can generally take up to several years or more. These estimates may change from time to time based on changes in utilization, payer and channel mixes. During 2024, we engaged a third-party specialist to
        assist in the evaluation of our accrual for U.S. Medicaid rebates related to the sale of our immunoglobulin products. As a result of this evaluation, we recognized a reduction in this accrual and a corresponding increase to net revenues of $12.6
        million during the year ended December 31, 2024 (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We considered several qualitative factors when evaluating our rebate accrual, such as the absence of a statutory limitation on the rebate amounts
        drug manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs and general uncertainty that pharmaceutical manufacturers have historically seen with government payors often submitting lagged claims many periods after the initial dispensing of a product to an
        end patient. There was additional new information that arose during June 2024 that suggested our liabilities for certain payor claims were successfully resolved, which resulted in the $12.6 million adjustment to the accrual for U.S. Medicaid
        rebates in June 2024. Additional changes in estimate assumptions surrounding U.S. Medicaid and other rebate obligations could materially impact our revenues and our results of operations in the future.

Stock-Based Compensation

All equity-based payments, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), are recognized at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, and compensation expense is recognized on a
        straight-line basis over the grantee’s requisite vesting period. For the purpose of valuing stock options granted to our employees, directors and executive officers, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We also use the Black-Scholes model
        when determining additional compensation cost resulting from the modification to previously issued option grants. The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options, which have no
        vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The Company’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the underlying Black-Scholes assumptions can materially affect the fair
        value estimate. To determine the risk-free interest rate, we utilize the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant with a term consistent with the term of our awards. The expected term of the options granted is in accordance with
        U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletins 107 and 110 and is based on the average between vesting terms and contractual terms. The expected dividend yield reflects our current and expected future policy for
        dividends on our common stock. The expected stock price volatility for our stock options was calculated by examining the historical volatility of our common stock since our common stock became publicly traded. We will continue to analyze the
        expected stock price volatility and expected term assumptions and will adjust our Black-Scholes option pricing assumptions as appropriate. Any changes in the foregoing Black-Scholes assumptions, or our election to utilize an alternative method for
        valuing stock options granted to employees, directors and executive officers, could potentially impact our stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations.

Deferred Tax Assets

Prior to December 31, 2024, we maintained a full valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets, and as a result we have historically not recorded an income tax benefit in the accompanying consolidated
        financial statements despite continued losses through December 31, 2023. This valuation allowance reflected our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we would generate sufficient taxable income in the future to be able to utilize
        our deferred tax assets. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies. We consider all positive and
        negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize our deferred tax assets, and we considered cumulative losses in recent years to be a significant type of negative evidence. As of December 31, 2024, we
        determined that it is more-likely-than-not that our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized. As a result, we recorded a release of the valuation allowance associated with these deferred tax assets, which was due in part to achieving
        three years of cumulative taxable income and projected taxable income that is more than sufficient to realize our federal and state deferred tax assets, and we recorded a deferred income tax benefit in the amount of $84.3 million for the year ended
        December 31, 2024 (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).

Revenues

We recorded total revenues of $426.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $258.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $168.2 million, or 65%. Excluding the $12.6 million
        adjustment we recorded in the second quarter of 2024 to decrease our accrual for estimated U.S. Medicaid rebates (which had the effect of increasing net revenues by $12.6 million), revenue increased by approximately $155.6 million, or 60%. This
        increase is primarily related to increased sales of ASCENIV, as we continue to experience increased physician, payer and patient acceptance and utilization of this product, as well as sales increases for some of our other IG products. The revenue
        increase also includes an increase in sales of normal source plasma (“NSP”) and hyperimmune Hepatitis B plasma by our Plasma Collection Centers business segment in the amount of $2.2 million.

Cost of Product Revenue and Gross Profit

Cost of product revenue was $206.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $169.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to volume-driven increases in
        product revenue costs related to our increased sales of IG products and plasma of $39.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a reduction in other manufacturing costs, mainly unabsorbed manufacturing expenses, of $5.1 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we had gross profit of $219.6 million, as compared to $88.9 million for the prior year, which represents a gross margin for fiscal 2024 of 51.5%, as compared to 34.4% for fiscal
        2023. Excluding the $12.6 million adjustment we recorded in the second quarter of 2024 to reduce our accrual for estimated U.S. Medicaid rebates, our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2024 was approximately $207.0 million, representing a
        gross margin of approximately 50.0%. The improvement in gross margin is mainly driven by a significantly more favorable mix of higher margin IG sales in 2024 as compared to 2023, along with the reduction in other manufacturing costs. We expect to
        see further shifts in our revenue mix toward higher margin IVIG products in fiscal 2025.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development (“R&D”) expenses totaled $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the absence of
        expenditures in 2024 related to the BIVIGAM post-marketing commitments, for which we incurred $1.7 million of expenses in 2023, partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with our ASCENIV pediatric study in the amount of $0.3 million.

Plasma Center Operating Expenses

Plasma center operating expenses, which primarily consists of compensation, benefits and travel for plasma center management and administrative staff, along with certain initial opening, marketing and start-up costs,
        were essentially unchanged at $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to approximately $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Amortization of Intangibles

Amortization expense mainly pertains to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in a 2017 acquisition transaction and was $0.4 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023,
        respectively. The intangible assets acquired in 2017 became fully amortized in June of 2024.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $74.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $15.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2023, and reflects an increase in
        stock-based compensation expense of $6.4 million in 2024, largely due to the higher valuation of grants awarded in 2024 and to additional compensation expense recognized for the modification of certain outstanding equity awards. The increase in
        SG&A also reflects increases in employee-related costs, including salaries and wages, benefits, relocation and recruiting, in the aggregate amount of $4.8 million, software maintenance expense of $1.2 million, consulting and professional fees
        of $0.9 million, audit and tax fees of $0.6 million, insurance expense of $0.6 million and temporary labor expense of $0.7 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased from 22.9% in fiscal 2023 to 17.4% in fiscal 2024.

Income from Operations

Our operating income was $139.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $117.4 million increase in operating income was mainly due to the
        improved gross profit, driven by both the year-over-year revenue growth and the shift in revenue mix toward significantly higher margin IVIG products, partially offset by $13.3 million of higher total operating expenses. The higher gross profit
        also reflects the foregoing adjustment to our accrual for estimated U.S. Medicaid rebates which increased our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 by $12.6 million.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $13.9 million, as compared to $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Prior to the refinancing of our senior debt on December 18, 2023 (see
        “Liquidity and Capital Resources”), our outstanding debt principal balance throughout 2023 ranged between $155.1 million and $158.6 million. The refinancing transaction reduced our debt principal to $135.0 million as of December 31, 2023, and we
        made additional principal payments on this indebtedness of $30.0 million on each of August 14, 2024 and December 19, 2024, reducing our debt principal balance to $75.0 million as of December 31, 2024. In addition, the stated interest rate on our
        debt during 2024 was approximately 10.1%, as compared to approximately 13.9% during 2023. We also incurred lower expense related to the amortization of debt discount in 2024 in the amount of $1.6 million. We expect our interest expense to continue
        to decline in 2025 due to the reduced debt principal balance and potential further repayments on our outstanding debt.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

As a result of the prepayment we made on our senior debt on December 19, 2024, we incurred a prepayment penalty in the amount of $0.45 million and recorded a partial write-down of unamortized debt discount of
        approximately $0.8 million, for a loss on this partial extinguishment of debt in the amount of $1.2 million. In connection with the foregoing refinancing of our senior debt in December of 2023, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt in the
        amount of $26.2 million, which is comprised of a prepayment penalty paid to our previous lender in the amount of $11.1 million, and the write-off of unamortized discount related to the retired indebtedness in the approximate amount of $15.1 million
        (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Other Income, Net

Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1.9 million, as compared to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is mainly due to an increase in interest income of $0.5 million
        in 2024 resulting from higher average cash balances in 2024.

Income Tax Benefit

We recorded a total income tax benefit of $72.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, with no comparable amount for the year ended December 31, 2023. The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2024 includes a
        deferred tax benefit of $84.3 million related to the release of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, partially offset by current income tax expense of $12.3 million, which reflects federal and state income tax liabilities
        that are not fully sheltered by NOLs due to limitations from prior ownership changes and other limitations on net operating loss carryforwards under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (see “Risk Factors - Our ability to use our net
        operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) may be limited.” appearing elsewhere in this report and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We expect that we will record income tax expense in 2025 and beyond as we expect to continue to
        generate additional taxable income for the foreseeable future.

Net Income/Loss

Our net income was $197.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to a net loss of $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an improvement of $225.9 million. The increase was primarily due
        to the increase in operating income of $117.4 million, lower interest expense of $11.1 million discussed above, a reduced loss on the extinguishment of debt as compared to fiscal 2023 and the income tax benefit of $72.0 million. The foregoing
        change in estimate in our accrual for Medicaid rebates favorably impacted our net after-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2024 by approximately $11.4 million.

Revenues

We recorded total revenues of $258.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $154.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $104.1 million, or approximately 68%. The increase
        is primarily related to increased sales of our immunoglobulin products, mainly ASCENIV and BIVIGAM, generated by our Boca Facility manufacturing operations in 2023 of $105.8 million, as we continue to experience increased physician, payer and
        patient acceptance and utilization of ASCENIV and expand our customer base for BIVIGAM, partially offset by a decrease in sales of plasma in our Plasma Collection Centers business segment of $1.5 million. During 2023, we began utilizing a
        substantial majority of the plasma collected at our plasma collection facilities for our IVIG production, with significantly less emphasis on plasma sales to third-party customers.

Cost of Product Revenue and Gross Profit

Cost of product revenue was $169.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $118.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is primarily attributable to volume-driven increases in
        product revenue costs related to the increased sales of our immunoglobulin products of $54.9 million. Cost of product revenue was also impacted by the inventory losses of $2.1 million related to the June 2023 IT disruption, partially offset by a
        decrease in other manufacturing expenses of approximately $6.2 million in 2023, mainly due to a shorter planned shutdown of the Boca Facility in 2023 as compared to 2022.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had gross profit of $88.9 million, as compared to $35.3 million for the same period of a year ago. This gross profit increase of $53.7 million was primarily due to the revenue
        increases and the supply chain and manufacturing enhancements at the Boca Facility which include producing at the increased 4,400 liter scale, along with the reduction in other manufacturing costs discussed above as we elected to extend our
        otherwise-routine plant shutdown in the first quarter of 2022 in order to complete certain projects. We also experienced a more favorable sales mix in 2023 toward our higher margin products and benefitted from price increases for ASCENIV and
        BIVIGAM that were implemented late in 2022. As a result, we achieved a gross margin of 34.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Research and Development Expenses

R&D expenses totaled $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is primarily due to lower expenditures attributable to a
        third-party service provider in connection with an R&D project that was completed in early 2023.

Plasma Center Operating Expenses

Plasma Center Operating Expenses decreased from $17.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 to $4.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. As a result of our now having ten plasma centers in operation, we
        were able to more than double the number of liters of plasma collected, with a corresponding reduction in the cost per liter, in 2023 as compared to 2022, coupled with the changes in the market price of normal source plasma and its impact on the
        net realizable value of our plasma inventory, the amount of plasma center costs we capitalized into inventory increased by approximately $43.2 million in 2023. This amount was largely offset by increases in donor fees of $12.8 million,
        compensation, benefits and temporary labor of $3.9 million, softgoods and supplies of $5.0 million, donor testing expenses of $4.8 million, depreciation of $0.8 million, software maintenance expense of $0.9 million, janitorial, security and
        utilities expense of $0.5 million, travel expenses of $0.1 million, advertising expense of $0.2 million, repairs and maintenance expense of $0.2 million and rent of $0.2 million.  In addition, our plasma center collections and operating costs were
        unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.7 million due to the temporary closing of our plasma collection centers attributable to an IT disruption occurring in June 2023, of which all systems have since been fully restored.

Amortization of Intangibles

Amortization expense mainly pertains to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in a 2017 acquisition transaction and was $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $6.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase reflects higher
        expenses for employee-related costs including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, travel, relocation and recruiting of $2.4 million, data services and market intelligence fees in support of the continued ASCENIV and BIVIGAM
        commercialization efforts in the amount of $1.8 million, marketing and advertising expenses of $1.0 million, insurance expense of $0.6 million, software maintenance expense of $0.6 million and state and local taxes of $0.2 million.

Income/Loss from Operations

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had operating income of $21.6 million, as compared to an operating loss of $39.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $61.0 million improvement in operating results
        was mainly due to the improved gross profit of $53.7 million, largely driven by the year-over-year revenue growth and shift in revenue mix toward higher margin IVIG products, and the lower total operating expenses of $7.3 million.

Interest Expense

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $25.0 million, as compared to $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is mainly due to approximately $51.8 million of additional debt
        principal resulting from the refinancing of our senior credit facility on March 23, 2022, additional debt principal resulting from interest payments made “in kind” in the form of additional indebtedness of approximately $6.8 million, as well as an
        increase in the stated interest rate on our senior debt from 10.75% in 2022 to as high as 14.4% at certain points in fiscal 2023 as a result of increases in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). We expect our interest expense to decrease
        in 2024 as a result of the refinancing transaction we completed in December of 2023 (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”), which resulted in a lower debt principal balance and a reduction in the interest rate.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

In connection with the foregoing refinancing of our senior debt in December of 2023, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $26.2 million, which is comprised of a prepayment penalty paid to our
        previous lender in the amount of $11.1 million, and the write-off of unamortized discount related to the retired indebtedness in the approximate amount of $15.1 million (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”).

In connection with the refinancing of our senior credit facility on March 23, 2022, we incurred a loss on the extinguishment of debt in the amount of $6.7 million as a result of the redemption premium we paid to retire
        our previously existing credit facility in the amount of $2.0 million, and the write-off of unamortized debt discount of $4.7 million related to that facility (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.3 million, as compared to other expense, net, of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is mainly due to an increase in interest
        income of approximately $1.6 million in 2023 due to higher interest earned on our cash balances in 2023.

Net Loss

Our net loss was $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $65.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $37.7 million decrease in net loss was mainly due to the improvement in
        operating income/loss of $61.0 million and the $1.9 million increase in other income/expense, partially offset by a higher loss on extinguishment of debt of $19.5 million and higher interest expense of $5.7 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”), Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss)

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income (loss) are important non-GAAP financial measures used by our management and Board of Directors to assess our operating performance. We use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and
        Adjusted net income (loss) as key performance measures because we believe that they facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period that exclude, in the case of Adjusted net income (loss), items that are expected to be
        non-recurring, and in the case of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, potential differences driven by the impact of variations of non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, as well as, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, stock-based compensation or
        certain one-time and non-recurring items. In addition, we believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net loss and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies and other parties in evaluating companies
        in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt-service capabilities. See below for a reconciliation of our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income (loss) to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated
        and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Because EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income (loss) are measures not deemed to be in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income
        (loss) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry, because other companies may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income (loss) in a different manner than we calculate
        these measurements. 
Although the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as one of several financial measures to assess its operating performance, its use is limited as it excludes certain significant operating expenses. EBITDA,
          Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income (loss) are not intended to represent cash flows for the periods presented, nor have they been presented as an alternative to operating income/loss, net income/loss or as an indicator of operating
          performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table presents the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years
          ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

        Adjusted EBITDA increased by $67.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period of a year ago. The improvement is driven primarily by an increase in operating income in 2023 of $61.0 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At December 31, 2024, we had working capital of $275.9 million, primarily consisting of $170.2 million of inventory, cash and cash equivalents of $103.1 million and $50.0 million of accounts receivable, partially
        offset by current liabilities of $55.5 million, as compared to working capital at December 31, 2023 of $207.2 million, primarily consisting of $172.9 million of inventory, cash and cash equivalents of $51.4 million and accounts receivable of $27.4
        million, partially offset by current liabilities of $49.8 million. Although we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $308.6 million since inception, we had positive cash flow from operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 of
        $118.7 million and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Prior to fiscal 2024, we funded our operations over the previous few years primarily from the sale of our equity securities and debt financings. Our
        material cash requirements are primarily comprised of:

•

The collection and procurement of raw material source plasma, which includes plasma donor fees and plasma center supplies, and other raw materials necessary to maintain and scale up our manufacturing operations;

•

Employee compensation and benefits;

•

Capital expenditures for equipment upgrades and capacity expansion at the Boca Facility and to maintain our plasma collection facilities;

•

Interest on our debt;

•

Marketing programs, medical education and continued commercialization efforts;

•

Boca Facility maintenance, improvements, repairs and supplies;

•

Conducting required post-marketing clinical trials for ASCENIV; and

•

Continuous improvements and updates to our IT infrastructure, laboratory equipment and assays, and facilities and engineering equipment.

As we continue to onboard new staff and expand production at the Boca Facility, we may also decide to use cash on hand, in whole or in part, to purchase additional real estate to add redundancies, expand operations and prepare for future growth
        opportunities. In addition, our end-to-end production cycle time from procurement of raw materials to commercial release of finished product can take between seven and 12 months or potentially longer, requiring substantial inventories of raw
        material plasma and other manufacturing and laboratory testing materials and single use disposables.

78

Table of Contents

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we had pre-tax income and GAAP net income of $125.7 million and $197.7 million, respectively. We currently anticipate, based upon our projected revenue and expenditures, that our
        current cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable, along with our projected future operating cash flow, will be sufficient to fund our operations, as currently conducted, through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2026. However, our
        current outlook with respect to cash flows and profitability may change based upon several factors, including the continued success of our commercial efforts with respect to the sale of our products and the continued acceptability of our immune
        globulin products by physicians, patients or payers, and whether or not the assumptions underlying our projected revenues and expenses are correct. If we are unable to maintain positive cash flow throughout fiscal 2025, we may choose to raise
        additional capital. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue to maintain positive cash flow throughout fiscal 2025 and elect to raise additional capital, we may decide to do so through public or private equity offerings or debt financings,
        or we may enter into a corporate collaboration or licensing arrangement.  The sale of additional equity securities or debt financings, if convertible, could result in dilution to our stockholders and, in such event, the value and potential future
        market price of our common stock may decline.

ADMA continues to evaluate a variety of strategic alternatives, and the exploration of value-creating opportunities remains a top corporate priority.

On December 18, 2023 (the “Ares Closing Date”), we and all of our subsidiaries entered into a senior secured credit facility (the “Ares Credit Agreement”) with Ares Capital Corporation and certain
          credit funds affiliated with Ares Capital Corporation (collectively, “Ares”). The Ares Credit Agreement provided for a total of $135.0 million in senior secured credit facilities (the “Ares Credit Facility”) consisting of (i) a term loan in the
          aggregate principal amount of $62.5 million and (ii) a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $72.5 million (collectively, the “Ares Loans”), both of which were fully drawn on the Ares Closing Date. The Ares Credit
          Facility has a maturity date of December 20, 2027 (the “Ares Maturity Date”). On the Ares Closing Date, we used the proceeds from the Ares Loans, along with a portion of our existing cash on hand, to terminate and pay in full all of the
          outstanding obligations under our previous senior credit facility (the “Hayfin Credit Facility”) with Hayfin Services LLP (“Hayfin”) including the outstanding principal in the amount of $158.6 million, a prepayment penalty in the amount $11.1
          million, an exit fee of $1.6 million, all accrued and unpaid interest outstanding on the Hayfin Credit Facility as of the Ares Closing date, as well as certain fees and expenses related thereto. In connection with the payoff and termination of
          the Hayfin Credit Facility, we also wrote off $15.0 million of unamortized debt discount related to the Hayfin Credit Facility. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of the Hayfin Credit Facility in the amount
          of $26.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which is mainly comprised of the write-off of unamortized debt discount and the prepayment penalty.

On August 14, 2024, we repaid $30.0 million against the revolving credit facility and the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2024 was $42.5 million. On December
          19, 2024 we repaid $30.0 million against the term loan and the outstanding balance on the term loan as of December 31, 2024 was $32.5 million. In connection with the repayment against the term loan, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt
          in the approximate amount of $1.2 million, which is comprised of a prepayment penalty in the amount of $0.45 million and a partial write-off of unamortized discount attributable to the term loan in the amount of $0.8 million.

Borrowings under the term loan bear interest at the adjusted Term SOFR for a three‑month tenor in effect on the day that is two business days prior to the first day of the applicable calendar quarter
          plus 6.50% (the “Initial SOFR Term Loan Applicable Margin”). Borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at the adjusted Term SOFR for a three‑month tenor in effect on the day that is two business days prior to the first day of the
          applicable calendar quarter

plus

3.75% (the “SOFR Revolving Facility Applicable Margin”). On the Ares Closing Date, the interest rate on the term loan was
          approximately 11.9% and the interest rate on the revolving facility was approximately 9.1%, representing a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 10.4%. As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate on the term loan was approximately 10.9%
          and the interest rate on the revolving facility was approximately 8.3%, representing a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 9.4%.

Table of Contents

On the Ares Maturity Date, we are required to pay Ares the entire outstanding principal amount underlying the Ares Loans and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Prior to the Ares Maturity Date,
          there are no scheduled principal payments on the Ares Credit Facility, and we are required to make quarterly interest payments during the term of Ares Credit Facility of approximately $1.8 million. We may prepay the outstanding principal under
          the revolving facility, together with any accrued but unpaid interest on the prepaid principal amount, at any time and from time to time upon three business days’ prior written notice with no prepayment premium. However, in the event that we pay
          down an aggregate amount under the revolving facility that is greater than 50% of revolving facility commitment of $72.5 million, we will still be required to pay interest on 50% of this amount, or $36.3 million, through the term of Ares Credit
          Facility. We may prepay the outstanding principal on the term loan, together with any accrued but unpaid interest on the prepaid principal amount, at any time and from time to time upon three business days’ prior written notice, subject to the
          payment to Ares of a prepayment premium equal to (i) the present value as of such date of all remaining required interest payments on the principal amount being repaid plus 1.5% of the prepaid principal amount, if prepaid on or prior to the first
          anniversary of the Ares Closing Date, (ii) 1.5% of the prepaid principal amount, if prepaid after the first anniversary of the Ares Closing Date and on or prior to the second anniversary of the Ares Closing Date, or (iii) 1.0% of the prepaid
          principal amount, if prepaid on or prior to the third anniversary of the Ares Closing Date.

In connection with the closing of the Ares Credit Facility, we incurred fees and expenses related to the transaction of approximately $2.7 million, including a $1.7 million original issue discount
          payable to Ares, all of which was deducted from the Ares loan proceeds. In addition, we are also required to pay Ares an exit fee of $1.7 million upon the earlier of any prepayment date or the Ares Maturity Date, and this obligation has been
          accrued as a separate liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 in the amount of $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively. As a result, we recognized an aggregate debt discount of $4.4 million as of the Ares
          Closing Date, and the weighted-average effective interest rate on the Ares Loans as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 10.81% and 11.39%, respectively. In connection with the prepayment of the term loan on December 19, 2024, we also paid a pro
          rata portion of the exit fee in the amount of $0.4 million.

All of our obligations under the Ares Credit Agreement are secured by a first-priority lien and security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets, including intellectual
          property and all of the equity interests in our subsidiaries. The Ares Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and conditions that are customarily required for similar
          financings. The negative covenants include certain financial covenants, including maximum total leverage ratios and a $15.0 million liquidity covenant, and also restrict or limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other
          things and subject to certain exceptions contained in the Ares Credit Agreement, incur new indebtedness; create liens on assets; engage in certain fundamental corporate changes, such as mergers or acquisitions, or changes to our or our
          subsidiaries’ business activities; make certain Investments or Restricted Payments (each as defined in the Ares Credit Agreement); engage in certain affiliate transactions; or enter into, amend or terminate any other agreements that have the
          impact of restricting our ability to make loan repayments under the Ares Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the Ares Credit Agreement.

Events of default on the Ares Loans include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material
        judgments, cross-defaults to material contracts and events constituting a change of control. If there is an event of default, we will incur an increase in the rate of interest on the Ares Loans of 2% per annum.

On March 23, 2022 (the “Hayfin Closing Date”), we and all of our subsidiaries entered into the Hayfin Credit Agreement with Hayfin. The Hayfin Credit Agreement, as amended, provided for a senior secured term loan
        facility in a principal amount of up to $175.0 million, composed of (i) a term loan made on the Hayfin Closing Date in the principal amount of $150.0 million (the “Hayfin Closing Date Loan”), and (ii) a delayed draw term loan in the principal
        amount of $25.0 million (the “Hayfin Delayed Draw Loan” and, together with the Hayfin Closing Date Loan, the “Hayfin Loans”). The Hayfin Delayed Draw Loan was not drawn prior to our termination of the Hayfin Credit Agreement. The Hayfin Credit
        Facility had a maturity date of March 23, 2027 (the “Hayfin Maturity Date”), subject to acceleration pursuant to the Hayfin Credit Agreement, including upon an Event of Default (as defined in the Hayfin Credit Agreement).

On the Hayfin Closing Date, we used $100.0 million of the Hayfin Closing Date Loan to terminate and pay in full all of the outstanding obligations under our previous senior credit facility with Perceptive (see Note 7
        to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We also used $2.0 million of the Hayfin Closing Date Loan proceeds to pay a redemption premium to Perceptive and used approximately $1.0 million of the Hayfin Closing Date Loan proceeds to pay certain fees
        and expenses incurred in connection with this transaction. In addition, a $1.8 million upfront fee payable to Hayfin was paid “in kind” and was added to the outstanding principal balance in accordance with the terms of the Hayfin Credit Agreement.

Borrowings under the Hayfin Credit Agreement bore interest at the adjusted Term SOFR for either a one-month or three-month tenor, as elected by us, and subject to a floor of 1.25%, plus an applicable margin of 9.5%
        (the “Applicable Margin”); provided, however, that upon, and during the continuance of, an Event of Default, the Applicable Margin would increase by an additional 3% per annum. On May 1, 2023 the Hayfin Credit Agreement was amended to reduce the
        Applicable Margin from 9.5% to 8.5%. On the last day of each calendar month prior to the Ares Closing Date we paid accrued interest to Hayfin. On the Hayfin Closing Date, December 31, 2022 and the Ares Closing Date, the stated interest rate on the
        Hayfin Loans was 10.75%, approximately 13.7% and approximately 13.9%, respectively. We were also permitted to pay “in kind” a portion of the interest on the Hayfin Loans for each monthly interest period in an amount equal to 2.5% per annum, which
        was added to the principal amount of the outstanding debt under the Hayfin Credit Facility. From the Hayfin Closing Date through December 31, 2022, $3.0 million of interest was paid in kind and added to the balance of the outstanding Hayfin Loans.
        For the year ended December 31, 2023, $3.8 million of interest was paid in kind and added to the balance of the outstanding Hayfin Loans.

On the Ares Closing Date, we paid Hayfin the entire outstanding principal amount underlying the Hayfin Loans and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as an exit fee of 1.0% of the outstanding principal
        amount being paid. In accordance with the terms of the Hayfin Credit Agreement, we also paid Hayfin the early prepayment fee in the amount equal 7.0% of the prepaid principal amount, or $11.1 million.

All of our obligations under the Hayfin Credit Agreement were secured by a first-priority lien and security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets, including intellectual property and all
        of the equity interests in our subsidiaries. The Hayfin Credit Agreement contained certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and conditions that are customarily required for similar financings. The negative
        covenants restricted or limited our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things and subject to certain exceptions contained in the Hayfin Credit Agreement, incur new indebtedness; create liens on assets; engage in certain
        fundamental corporate changes, such as mergers or acquisitions, or changes to our or our subsidiaries’ business activities; make certain Investments or Restricted Payments (each as defined in the Hayfin Credit Agreement); change our fiscal year;
        pay dividends; repay other certain indebtedness; engage in certain affiliate transactions; or enter into, amend or terminate any other agreements that have the impact of restricting our ability to make loan repayments under the Hayfin Credit
        Agreement. In addition, we were required (i) at all times prior to the Hayfin Maturity Date to maintain a minimum cash balance of $6.0 million; and (ii) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, report IVIG product and related revenues for the
        trailing 12-month period that exceed the amounts set forth in the Hayfin Credit Agreement, which ranged from $75.0 million for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2022 to $110.0 million for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2023. As of the
        Ares Closing Date and December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants contained in the Hayfin Credit Agreement.

On December 9, 2022, we completed an underwritten public offering whereby we issued 24,125,873 shares of our common stock. Net proceeds after underwriting discounts and expenses associated with the offering were
        approximately $64.6 million and were used to accelerate commercialization and production activities, complete plasma center buildouts and obtain FDA approvals, to conclude post‑FDA marketing approval research and development projects, and for
        working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities

Cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $118.7 million, as compared to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is mainly due to substantially higher net income. The
        improvement in cash flow from operations in 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was mainly due to the improvement in our operating results, driven by higher revenues and gross margins, and a lower increase in inventories. The

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $8.6 million and is mainly comprised of equipment purchases and other capital expenditures at the Boca Facility. Cash used in investing
        activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $5.0 million, which was primarily comprised of capital expenditures of $3.0 million for equipment purchases and facilities upgrades at the Boca Facility, and $1.8 million to complete the buildout
        of our plasma collection facilities. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $13.9 million, which consisted of $8.7 million for the construction and buildout of several new plasma collection facilities and
        $5.2 million for equipment purchases and upgrades to the Boca Facility. While we do not have any firm commitments for material capital expenditures in 2025, we expect our total capital expenditures will be between $12.0 million and $18.0 million
        for fiscal 2025.

Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $58.3 million and was primarily composed of an aggregate of $60.0 million of debt principal payments during the year. Net cash used in
        financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $39.0 million, as we reduced our outstanding debt principal by $23.6 million with the refinancing of our senior debt on December 18, 2023 and paid approximately $12.7 million to exit the
        Hayfin Credit Facility. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $108.9 million, as we received approximately $47.0 in net proceeds from the refinancing of our senior credit facility in March of 2022 and
        $64.6 million in net proceeds from the December 9, 2022 public offering of our common stock.

Effect of Inflation

Inflation impacted a number of facets of our business during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 at each of our business segments. Disruptions in the global economy have impeded global supply chains,
        resulted in longer lead times and delays in procuring certain raw materials, and resulted in inflationary cost increases in certain raw materials, labor and transportation. We also experienced price increases for, among other items, consumable
        supplies, services for repairs and maintenance of our facilities, utilities, shipping and freight charges, fuel surcharges and labor costs, among other expenses. Based upon the macroeconomic environment, publicly available information and reports
        from the U.S. government, we expect this trend to subside somewhat in 2025, however we cannot predict the extent to which future domestic and global economic conditions including, but not limited to, supply chain constraints or geopolitical
        conditions, including the continuing conflicts in Europe and in the Middle East and surrounding areas, could have a significant impact on our future results of operations. In addition, some of our third-party inventory purchase agreements provide
        for scheduled price increases that are tied to various consumer price indices, which have resulted in higher than historical percentage price increases and could result in higher source plasma and other raw material and supplies costs in 2025 and
        beyond. Also, in a higher inflationary environment, we may not be able to raise the prices of our products to keep up with the rate of inflation.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates. Our senior credit facility with Ares requires quarterly payments of interest based on the adjusted Term SOFR plus the Applicable Margin. We
        currently do not utilize any derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps or caps, to mitigate this risk. As of December 31, 2024, we had $75.0 million outstanding under our senior credit facility that is subject to a variable
        interest rate. As a result, the effect of a hypothetical, instantaneous and unfavorable change of 100 basis points in the interest rate would have an approximate $0.8 million annualized negative impact on our earnings and cash flows.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. The term “disclosure
        controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
        files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
        to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
        officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their
        objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our Chief
        Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Annual Report on
        Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Management of ADMA Biologics, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in
      Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s
      Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
      accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
      assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of our Company are being made only in
      accordance with authorizations of management and Directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our Company’s assets that could have a
      material effect on the financial statements.

Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
      regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
      or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
      procedures may deteriorate.

Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
      Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 based on those criteria.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited the consolidated
      financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has also issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Their report appears on page F-3 of this Annual Report on
      Form 10-K.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

ADMA Biologics, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited ADMA Biologics, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal
              control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on 
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our
              opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
              Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
              Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated 
balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
              for 
the year ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II - valuation and qualifying accounts(collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated 
March

              18, 2025 
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
              control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
              Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
              Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
              standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial
              reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
              assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over
                Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
                to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
                over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
                provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
                made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
                that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
              reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
              compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ADMA Biologics, Inc.:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of ADMA
              Biologics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for 
the period ended December 31, 2024, and the
              related notes and financial statement schedule II - valuation and qualified accounts (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
              financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
              Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
              Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
              Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
              Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
              standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures
              to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
              regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
              the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the
                current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial
                statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we
                are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Valuation of the U.S. Medicaid rebate accrual for immunoglobulin products

As disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
              recognizes immunoglobulin product revenue net of estimated rebates. The amount of these rebate are based on contractual agreements and historical experience. These estimated rebates include U.S. Medicaid rebates, which, the Company accrues
              for in the same period the product is sold, however, third-party reporting and payments of the rebate amount occur on a time lag. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had recorded $4.2 million of accrued rebates included in accrued expenses
              and other liabilities on the balance sheet, of which a portion related to Medicaid rebates.

We identified the estimate of rebate accruals for U.S. Medicaid claims as a
              critical audit matter. The evaluation of historical claims experience, current sales volumes and the claims processing time lag associated with U.S. Medicaid reporting rebate amounts involved subjective auditor judgement. The key assumptions
              made included the historical percentage of U.S. Medicaid rebates paid to gross sales and assumption that the historical patterns will be indicative of future patterns.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this
              critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s process to estimate the U.S. Medicaid rebate accrual, including historical claims experience, current
              sales volumes and the claims time lag. We evaluated the U.S. Medicaid rebate accrual by (1) obtaining an understanding of the estimation methodology, (2) recalculating management’s estimate of the accrual by utilizing current gross sales and
              the historical revenue and rebates paid data and(3) testing the appropriateness of the assumptions of using a certain number of months of historical data and that historical results are indicative of future expectations by reviewing the
              Company’s historical trends.

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of ADMA Biologics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, and the related
              consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes 
and financial statement schedule
              II – valuation and qualifying accounts (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
              December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
              consolidated financial statements. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the
              U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
              about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

1.

ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS

ADMA Biologics, Inc. (“ADMA” or the “Company”) is an end-to-end commercial biopharmaceutical company dedicated to manufacturing, marketing
          and developing specialty biologics for the treatment of immunodeficient patients at risk for infection and others at risk for certain infectious diseases. The Company’s targeted patient populations include immune-compromised individuals who
          suffer from an underlying immune deficiency disorder or who may be immune-suppressed for medical reasons.

ADMA operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries ADMA BioManufacturing, LLC (“ADMA BioManufacturing”) and ADMA BioCenters Georgia Inc.
          (“ADMA BioCenters”). ADMA BioManufacturing was formed in January 2017 to facilitate the acquisition of certain assets held by the Company’s former third-party contract manufacturer, which included the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
          (“FDA”)-licensed BIVIGAM and Nabi-HB immunoglobulin products, and an FDA-licensed plasma fractionation manufacturing facility located in Boca Raton, FL (the “Boca Facility”). ADMA BioCenters is the Company’s source plasma collection business with

ten
 plasma collection facilities located throughout the U.S., all of which hold an approved license with the FDA.

The Company has 
three

          FDA-approved products, all of which are currently marketed and commercially available: (i) 
ASCENIV (Immune Globulin Intravenous, Human – slra 10% Liquid), an intravenous immune globulin (“IVIG”) product indicated for the treatment of Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency (“PI”), also known as Primary
            Immunodeficiency Disease (“PIDD”) or Inborn Errors of Immunity, for which the Company received FDA approval on April 1, 2019 and commenced first commercial sales in October 2019; (ii) BIVIGAM (Immune Globulin Intravenous, Human), an IVIG
            product indicated for the treatment of PI, and for which the Company received FDA approval on May 9, 2019 and commenced commercial sales in August 2019;  and (iii) Nabi-HB (Hepatitis B Immune Globulin, Human), which is indicated for the
            treatment of acute exposure to blood containing Hepatitis B surface antigen (“HBsAg”) and other listed exposures to Hepatitis B. In addition to its commercially available immunoglobulin products, the Company generates revenues from the sale of
            intermediate by-products that result from the immunoglobulin production process and from time to time provides contract manufacturing and laboratory services for certain clients. The Company seeks to develop a pipeline of plasma-derived
            therapeutics, and its products and product candidates are intended to be used by physician specialists focused on caring for immune-compromised patients with or at risk for certain infectious diseases
.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of consolidation and basis of presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ADMA and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared
          in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). All intercompany balances have
          been eliminated in consolidation. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting
          Standards Board (the “FASB”). 

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
comprehensive income (loss) was equal to the net income (loss) amounts presented for the respective periods in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 
In addition, certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Specifically, the disaggregation of some of the Company’s accrued expenses and other current liabilities
            (see Note 6) and deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as the rate reconciliation for U.S. federal income taxes (see Note 11), as of December 31, 2023 have been adjusted to conform to the presentation as of December 31, 2024
.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
          and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
          Significant estimates include rebates and chargebacks deducted from gross revenues, assumptions used in the fair value of awards granted under the Company’s equity incentive plans and the valuation allowance for the Company’s deferred tax assets.

Table of Contents

ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The
            Company engaged a third-party specialist to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s accrual for U.S. Medicaid rebates related to the sale of the Company’s immunoglobulin products. As a result of this evaluation, the Company recognized a
            reduction in this accrual and a corresponding increase to net revenues of $
12.6
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The
            Company considered several qualitative factors when evaluating its rebate accrual, such as the absence of a statutory limitation on the rebate amounts drug manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs and general uncertainty that pharmaceutical
            manufacturers have historically seen with government payors often submitting lagged claims many periods after the initial dispensing of a product to an end patient. There was additional new information that arose during June 2024 that suggested
            the Company’s liabilities for certain payor claims were successfully resolved, which resulted in the $
12.6
 million adjustment to the
            accrual for U.S. Medicaid rebates in June 2024.

Cash and cash equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

The Company regularly maintains cash and cash equivalents at third-party financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
          Corporation insurance limit. Although the Company monitors the daily cash balances in its operating accounts and adjusts the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted, and there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s
          business, if one or more of the financial institutions with which the Company has deposits fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets. To date, the Company has not experienced a loss or lack of access to
          its deposited cash or cash equivalents; however, the Company cannot provide assurance that access to its cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets in the future.

Accounts receivable

Accounts receivable is reported at realizable value, net of allowances for
            contractual credits and doubtful accounts in the amount of $
0.2
 million and $
0.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are recognized in the period the related revenue is recorded. The Company extends credit to its customers
            based upon an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition and credit history. Evaluations of the financial condition and associated credit risk of customers are performed on an ongoing basis.

Inventories

Raw materials inventory consists of 
normal source plasma (“NSP”) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (“RSV”) high titer plasma collected at the Company’s plasma collection
              facilities or purchased from third parties, along with

various materials purchased from suppliers, used in the production of the Company’s products. Work-in-process and finished goods inventories (see Note 3) reflect the cost
          of raw materials as well as costs for direct and indirect labor, primarily salaries, wages and benefits for applicable employees, as well as an allocation of overhead costs related to the Boca Facility including utilities, property taxes, general
          repairs and maintenance, consumable supplies and depreciation. The allocation of Boca Facility overhead to inventory is generally based upon the estimated square footage of the Boca Facility that is used in the production of the Company’s
          products relative to the total square footage of the facility. 

Inventories, including plasma intended for resale and plasma intended for internal use in the Company’s manufacturing, commercialization
          or research and development activities, are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method. For both the Company’s immune globulin products and plasma intended for resale and internal use, net
          realizable value is generally determined based upon the consideration the Company expects to receive when the inventory is sold, less costs to deliver the inventory to the recipient. The estimates for net realizable value of inventory are based
          on contractual terms or upon historical experience and certain other assumptions, and the Company believes that such assumptions are reasonable. Inventory is periodically reviewed to ensure that its carrying value does not exceed its net
          realizable value, and adjustments are recorded to write down such inventory, with a corresponding charge to cost of product revenue, when the carrying value or historical cost exceeds its estimated net realizable value. In addition, costs
          associated with the production of engineering lots that would not qualify as immediately available for commercial sale are charged to cost of product revenue and not capitalized into inventory.

ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Property and equipment

Assets comprising property and equipment (see Note 4) are stated at cost
            less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset’s estimated useful life. Land is not depreciated. The buildings have been assigned a useful life of 
30 years
. Property and equipment other than land and buildings have useful lives ranging from 
3
 to 
15 years
. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
            lesser of the lease term or their estimated useful lives.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired by the Company. Goodwill at December 31, 2024
          and 2023 was $
3.5
 million, all of which is attributable to the Company’s ADMA BioManufacturing business segment. There were 
no
 changes to the carrying amount of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The Company
          has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If the
          Company concludes that this is the case, then it must perform a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. An impairment charge is recorded to the extent the reporting unit’s carrying value
          exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1 of each year. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment assessments
          as of October 1, 2024, 2023 and 2022 did not result in any impairment charges related to goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Impairment of long-lived assets

The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets,
          whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If indicators of impairment exist, projected future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to its carrying amount to determine
          whether the asset’s carrying value is recoverable. Any resulting impairment is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset in excess of fair value and a charge to operating results. For the years ended December 31, 2024,
          2023 and 2022, the Company determined that there was 
no
 impairment of its long-lived assets. 

Revenue recognition

Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are comprised of (i) revenues from the sale of the Company’s immunoglobulin
          products, ASCENIV, BIVIGAM and Nabi-HB, (ii) product revenues from the sale of human plasma collected by the Company’s Plasma Collection Centers business segment, (iii) contract manufacturing and laboratory services revenue, (iv) revenues from
          the sale of intermediate by-products and (v) license and other revenues primarily attributable to the out-licensing of ASCENIV to Biotest AG (“Biotest”) in 2012 to market and sell this product in Europe and selected countries in North Africa and
          the Middle East. Biotest has provided the Company with certain services and financial payments in accordance with the related Biotest license agreement and is obligated to pay the Company certain amounts in the future if certain milestones are
          achieved. Deferred revenue is amortized into income over the term of the Biotest license, representing a period of approximately 
22 years
.

Product revenue is recognized when the customer is deemed to have control over the product and the performance obligation is satisfied.
          Control is determined based on when the product is shipped or delivered and title passes to the customer. Revenue is recorded in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange. Revenue from the sale of the
          Company’s immunoglobulin products is recognized when the product reaches the customer’s destination, and is recorded net of estimated rebates, 
wholesaler distribution and related
            fees, customer incentives, including prompt pay discounts, wholesaler chargebacks, group purchasing organization fees and reimbursements for patient assistance. These estimates are based on contractual arrangements, historical experience and
            certain other assumptions, and while the Company believes that such estimates are reasonable, they are subject to change based on future developments and other factors.

ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For revenues
            associated with contract manufacturing and the sale of intermediates, control transfers to the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied when the customer takes possession of the product from the Boca Facility
.

Product revenues from the sale of human plasma collected at the Company’s plasma collection centers are recognized at the time control of
          the product has been transferred to the customer
 and the performance obligation is satisfied, which generally occurs at the time of shipment from
            one of the Company’s plasma collection facilities or from a third-party warehouse that is utilized by the Company. Product revenues are recognized at the time of delivery if the Company retains control of the product during shipment
.

For all of the Company’s product revenues, payment from the customer is typically due within 
90 days
 of sale.

Cost of product revenue

Cost of product revenue includes costs associated with the manufacture of
            the Company’s FDA approved products and intermediates and for the collection of human source plasma, as well as expenses related to conformance batch production, process development and scientific and technical operations when these operations
            are attributable to marketed products. When the activities of these operations are attributable to new products in development, the expenses are classified as research and development expenses.

Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses consist of clinical research organization
            costs, costs related to clinical trials, post-marketing commitment studies for BIVIGAM and ASCENIV and salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees directly related to research and development activities. All research and
            development costs are expensed as incurred.

Plasma center operating expenses

Plasma center operating expenses consist of certain general and administrative plasma center costs, initial opening, marketing and
          start-up costs, rent expense, maintenance, utilities and compensation and benefits for administrative staff.

Advertising and marketing expenses

Advertising and marketing expense includes cost for promotional materials and trade show expenses for the marketing of the Company’s
          products and expenses incurred for attracting donors to the Company’s plasma collection centers. All advertising and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred.  Advertising and marketing expenses were $
2.7
 million, $
3.3
 million and $
2.2
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Stock-based compensation

The Company follows recognized accounting guidance which requires all equity-based payments, including grants of stock options and
          restricted stock unit awards (“RSUs”), to be recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense based on their fair values at the date of grant. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and directors with service-based
          vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis over the associated vesting period of the award based on the grant date fair value of the award. Stock options granted to employees under the Company’s equity incentive plans generally
          have a 
four-year
 vesting period and a term of 
10 years
. RSUs granted to employees also have a 
four-year
 vesting period. For milestone-based equity
          awards, 
which were awarded to 
two

            of the Company’s executive officers in September of 2021 and vested during fiscal 2022,
 the Company would periodically assess the probability of vesting for each milestone-based award and adjust compensation expense based on its
          probability assessment. Pursuant to ASU No. 2016-09, 
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)
, the Company has elected not to establish a forfeiture rate, as stock-based
          compensation expense related to forfeitures of unvested equity awards is fully reversed at the time of forfeiture.

ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Income taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in
          the consolidated financial statements or its tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting
          amounts at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not generate
          sufficient taxable income to utilize its deferred tax assets (see Note 11). The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities for all tax years since 2020 and for previous periods as it relates to the Company’s net
          operating loss carryforwards.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income or loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average
          number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing net income or loss attributable to common stockholders as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, if any, by the weighted
          average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common stock includes the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants (using
          the treasury stock method) 
and upon the vesting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”). Potentially dilutive common stock in the diluted net
            earnings (loss) per share computation is excluded to the extent that it would be anti-dilutive. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows:

Fair value of financial instruments

The carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments,
            including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are shown at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The debt outstanding under the Company’s senior notes payable (see
            Note 7) also approximates fair value, based on a Level 3 classification under the fair value hierarchy, due to the variable interest rate on this debt.

On December 18, 2023 (the “Ares Closing Date”), the Company
            and all of its subsidiaries entered into a new senior secured credit facility (the “Ares Credit Agreement”) with Ares Capital Corporation and certain credit funds affiliated with Ares Capital Corporation (collectively, “Ares”). The Ares Credit
            Agreement provided for a total of $
135.0
 million in senior secured credit facilities (the “Ares Credit Facility”) consisting of (i) a
            term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $
62.5
 million and (ii) a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount
            of $
72.5
 million (collectively, the “Ares Loans”), both of which were fully drawn on the Ares Closing Date. The Ares Credit Facility
            has a maturity date of 
December 20, 2027
 (the “Ares Maturity Date”). On the Ares Closing Date, the Company used the proceeds from
            the Ares Loans, along with a portion of its existing cash on hand, to terminate and pay in full all of the outstanding obligations under the Company’s previous senior credit facility (the “Hayfin Credit Facility”) with Hayfin Services LLP
            (“Hayfin”) including the outstanding principal in the amount of $
158.6
 million, a prepayment penalty in the amount $
11.1
 million, an exit fee of $
1.6

            million, all accrued and unpaid interest outstanding on the Hayfin Credit Facility as of the Ares Closing date, as well as certain fees and expenses related thereto. In connection with the payoff and termination of the Hayfin Credit Facility,
            the Company also wrote off $
15.0
 million of unamortized debt discount related to the Hayfin Credit Facility. As a result of this
            transaction, the Company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of the Hayfin Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2023 in the amount of $
26.2

            million, which is mainly comprised of the write-off of unamortized debt discount and the prepayment penalty.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On August 14, 2024, the Company repaid $
30.0

                million against the revolving credit facility and the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2024 was $
42.5

                million, with an additional $
30.0
 million of availability through the Ares Maturity Date. The Company is required to pay an
                unused commitment fee of 
0.5
% per annum for this availability. 

On December 19, 2024 the Company repaid $
30.0

              million against the term loan and the outstanding balance on the term loan as of December 31, 2024 was $
32.5
 million. In connection
              with the repayment against the term loan, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt in the approximate amount of $
1.2

              million, which is comprised of a prepayment penalty in the amount of $
0.5
 million and a partial write-off of unamortized discount
              attributable to the term loan in the amount of $
0.8
 million.

Borrowings under the term loan bear interest at the adjusted
            Term SOFR for a 
three-month
 tenor in effect on the day that is 
two
 business days prior to the first day of the applicable calendar quarter plus 
6.50
%.
            Borrowings under the revolving facility initially bear interest at the adjusted Term SOFR for a 
three-month
 tenor in effect on the
            day that is 
two
 business days prior to the first day of the applicable calendar quarter plus 
3.75
%. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the interest rate on the term loan was approximately 
10.85
% and 
11.88
%, respectively, and the interest rate on
            the revolving facility was approximately 
8.34
% and 
9.13
%, respectively.

On the
            Ares Maturity Date, the Company is required to pay Ares the entire outstanding principal amount underlying the Ares Loans and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Prior to the Ares Maturity Date, there are 
no
 scheduled principal payments on the Ares Credit Facilities. After giving effect to the principal payments made during the year ended December 31,
            2024, the Company is required to make 
quarterly
 interest payments to Ares of approximately $
1.8
 million. The Company may prepay the outstanding principal under the revolving facility, together with any accrued but unpaid interest on the prepaid principal amount,
            at any time and from time to time upon 
three
 business days’ prior written notice with 
no
 prepayment premium. However, in the event the Company pays down an aggregate amount under the Revolving Facility that is greater than 
50
% of the $
72.5
 million commitment
            amount, the Company will still be required to pay interest on 
50
% of this amount, or $
36.3
 million, through the term of Ares Credit Facility. The Company may prepay the outstanding principal on the term loan, together with any accrued but unpaid interest on
            the prepaid principal amount, at any time and from time to time upon 
three
 business days’ prior written notice, subject to the
            payment to Ares of a prepayment premium equal to (i) the present value as of such date of all remaining required interest payments on the principal amount being repaid plus 
1.5
% of the prepaid principal amount, if prepaid on or prior to the first anniversary of the Ares Closing Date, (ii) 
1.5
% of the prepaid principal amount, if prepaid after the first anniversary of the Ares Closing Date and on or prior to the second anniversary of the Ares Closing Date, or (iii) 
1.0
% of the prepaid principal amount, if prepaid on or prior to the third anniversary of the Ares Closing Date. 

In connection with
            the closing of the Ares Credit Facility, the Company incurred fees and expenses related to the transaction of $
2.8
 million, including
            a $
1.7
 million original discount payable to Ares, all of which was deducted from the Ares loan proceeds. In addition, the Company is
            also required to pay Ares an exit fee of $
1.7
 million upon the earlier of any prepayment date or the Ares Maturity Date, and this
            obligation was accrued as a separate liability in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. As a result, the Company recognized an aggregate debt discount of $
4.4
 million as of the Ares Closing Date, and the weighted-average effective interest rate on the Ares Loans was 
10.81
% and 
11.39
% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This
            debt discount was recorded as a reduction to the face amount of the debt and is being amortized as interest expense over the term of the debt using the interest method. In connection with the prepayment of the term loan on December 19, 2024,
            the Company also paid a pro rata portion of the exit fee in the amount of $
0.4
 million, and the balance of the exit fee liability as
            of December 31, 2024 is $
1.3
 million.

All of the Company’s obligations under the Ares Credit Agreement are secured by a first-priority lien and security interest in substantially all
              of the Company’s tangible and intangible assets, including intellectual property and all of the equity interests in the Company’s subsidiaries. The Ares Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants,
              negative covenants and conditions that are customarily required for similar debt financings. The negative covenants include certain financial covenants, including maximum total leverage ratios and a $
15.0
 million minimum liquidity covenant, and also restrict or limit the Company’s ability and the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to, among other things and subject
              to certain exceptions contained in the Ares Credit Agreement, incur new indebtedness; create liens on assets; engage in certain fundamental corporate changes, such as mergers or acquisitions, or changes to the Company’s or the Company’s
              subsidiaries’ business activities; make certain Investments or Restricted Payments (each as defined in the Ares Credit Agreement); engage in certain affiliate transactions; or enter into, amend or terminate any other agreements that have the
              impact of restricting the Company’s ability to make loan repayments under the Ares Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2024 the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the Ares Credit Agreement.

Events of Default on the Ares Loans include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of
            representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments, cross-defaults to material contracts and events constituting a change of control. If there is an event of default, the Company will incur an increase in the
            rate of interest on the Ares Loans of 
2
% per annum.

On 
March 23, 2022 (the “Hayfin Closing Date”), the Company and all of its subsidiaries entered into the Hayfin Credit
              Agreement with Hayfin. The Hayfin Credit Agreement provided for a senior secured term loan facility in a principal amount of up to
 $
175.0

            million, 
composed of (i) a term loan made on the Hayfin Closing Date in the principal
              amount of
 $
150.0
 million
 (
the “Hayfin Closing Date
                Loan”), and (ii) a delayed draw term loan in the principal amount of 
$
25.0
 million (the “
Hayfin 
Delayed Draw Loan
” 
and, together with the Hayfin Closing Date Loan, the “Hayfin Loans
”). 
The Hayfin Delayed Draw Loan was not drawn prior to the Ares Closing Date. The Hayfin Credit Facility had a maturity date of 
March 23, 2027
 (the “Hayfin Maturity Date”), subject to acceleration pursuant to the Hayfin Credit Agreement, including upon an Event of Default
              (as defined in the Hayfin Credit Agreement).

On the
        Hayfin Closing Date, the Company used $
100.0
 million of the Hayfin Closing Date Loan to terminate and pay in full all of the outstanding
        obligations under the Company’s previously existing credit facility (the “Perceptive Credit Facility”) with Perceptive Credit Holdings II, LP (“Perceptive”). The Company also used $
2.0
 million of the Hayfin Closing Date Loan proceeds to pay a redemption premium to Perceptive and used approximately $
1.0
 million of the Hayfin Closing Date Loan proceeds to pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with this transaction. In addition, a $
1.8
 million upfront fee payable to Hayfin was paid “in kind” and was added to the outstanding principal balance in accordance with the terms of the Hayfin Credit Agreement. In
        connection with the retirement of the Perceptive Credit Facility and all of the obligations thereunder, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of $
6.7
 million, consisting of the write-off of unamortized discount related to the Perceptive indebtedness and the redemption premium paid to Perceptive.

Borrowings under the Hayfin Credit Agreement bore
            interest, at the Company’s election, at the adjusted Term SOFR for a 
one-month
 tenor, subject to a floor of 
1.25
%, plus an applicable margin of 
9.5
%
            (the “Applicable Margin”); provided, however, that upon, and during the continuance of, an Event of Default, the Applicable Margin would increase by an additional 
3
% per annum. On May 1, 2023 the Hayfin Credit Agreement was amended to reduce the Applicable Margin from 
9.5
% to 
8.5
%. On the last day of each calendar month prior to the Ares
            Closing Date, the Company paid accrued interest to Hayfin. The rate of interest in effect as of the Hayfin Closing Date, December 31, 2022 and the Ares Closing Date was 
10.75
%, approximately 
13.7
% and approximately 
13.9
%, respectively. The Company was also permitted to pay “in kind” a portion of the interest on the Hayfin Loans for each monthly interest period
            in an amount equal to 
2.5
% per annum, which was added to the principal amount of the outstanding debt under the Hayfin Credit
            Facility. From the Hayfin Closing Date through December 31, 2022, $
3.0
 million of interest was paid in kind and added to the balance
            of the outstanding Hayfin Loans. For the year ended December 31, 2023, $
3.8
 million of interest was paid in kind and added to the
            balance of the outstanding Hayfin Loans.

On the Ares Closing Date, the Company
            paid Hayfin the entire outstanding principal amount underlying the Hayfin Loans and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, as well as the exit fee of 
1.0
% of the outstanding principal amount paid. This exit fee had been recorded separately as a non-current liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
            2022. In accordance with the terms of the Hayfin Credit Agreement, the Company also paid Hayfin the early prepayment fee in the amount equal to 
7.0
%
            of the prepaid principal amount of $
158.6
 million, or $
11.1
 million.

All of the Company’s obligations under the Hayfin Credit Agreement were secured by a first-priority lien and security interest in substantially all of the Company’s tangible and intangible assets,
          including intellectual property, and all of the equity interests in the Company’s subsidiaries. The Hayfin Credit Agreement contained certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and conditions that are
          customarily required for similar debt financings. The negative covenants restricted or limited the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things and subject to certain exceptions contained in the Hayfin Credit Agreement,
          incur new indebtedness; create liens on assets; engage in certain fundamental corporate changes, such as mergers or acquisitions, or changes to the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ business activities; make certain Investments or Restricted
          Payments (each as defined in the Hayfin Credit Agreement); change its fiscal year; pay dividends; repay certain other indebtedness; engage in certain affiliate transactions; or enter into, amend or terminate any other agreements that have the
          impact of restricting the Company’s ability to make loan repayments under the Hayfin Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company was required (i) at all times prior to the Hayfin Maturity Date to maintain a minimum cash balance of $
6.0
 million; and (ii) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, report IVIG product and related revenues for the trailing 12-month period that exceed
          the amounts set forth in the 
Hayfin
 Credit Agreement, which ranged from $
75.0
 million for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022 to $
110.0
 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. As of the Ares Closing Date and December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the 
Hayfin
 Credit Agreement. 

           As consideration for the Hayfin
          Credit Agreement, on the Hayfin Closing Date the Company issued to various entities affiliated with Hayfin warrants to purchase an aggregate of 
9,103,047

          shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Hayfin Warrants”). The Hayfin Warrants have an exercise price equal to $
1.6478
 per share,
          which is equal to the trailing 
30
-day Volume Weighted-average Price of the Company’s common stock on the business day immediately
          prior to the Hayfin Closing Date. The Hayfin Warrants were valued by the Company at approximately $
9.6
 million as of the Hayfin Closing
          Date and have an expiration date of 
March 23, 2029
 (see Note 8). As consideration for the foregoing amendment to the Hayfin Credit
          Agreement on May 1, 2023, the Company issued additional warrants to the lenders to purchase 
2,391,244
 shares of the Company’s common
          stock at an exercise price of $

 per share (the “Hayfin Second Amendment Warrants”). The Hayfin Second Amendment Warrants were
          valued at approximately $
5.6
 million and have an expiration date of 
May 1, 2030
.

As a result of the upfront fee and exit fee paid or payable to Hayfin, the expenses incurred by the Company  in connection with this transaction and
            the value of the Hayfin Warrants and Hayfin Second Amendment Warrants, the Company recognized a discount on the Hayfin Loans in the amount of $
13.9

            million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and an additional debt discount in the year ended December 31, 2023 in the amount of $
5.7

            million. The Company records debt discount as a reduction to the face amount of the debt, and the debt discount is amortized as interest expense over the life of the debt using the interest method. As of the Ares Closing Date, $
15.0
 million of the aggregate debt discount associated with the Hayfin Credit Facility was unamortized, and this amount is reflected in the loss on
            extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2023. Based on the fair value of the Hayfin Warrants and the aggregate amount of fees and expenses associated with obtaining the Hayfin Credit Facility, the effective interest rate on the
            Hayfin Loans as of the Hayfin Closing Date and as of December 31, 2022 was approximately 
13.0
% and 
16.1
%, respectively
.

Equity Incentive Plans

 On June 21, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved the ADMA Biologics, Inc. 2022 Compensation Plan (the “2022 Equity Plan”), which replaced the Company’s Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Compensation
                  Plan (the “2014 Plan”). Approval of the 2022 Equity Plan resulted in approximately 
18
 million additional shares of the
                  Company’s common stock being reserved for future awards. The 2022 Equity Plan provides for the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) or a Committee of the Board (the “Committee”) to grant awards to grantees and to determine the
                  exercise price, vesting term, expiration date and all other terms and conditions of the awards, including acceleration of the vesting of an award at any time. Any options granted under the 2022 Equity Plan are intended to be Incentive
                  Stock Options (“ISOs”), unless specified by the Committee to be Non-Qualified Options (“NQOs”) as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. ISOs and NQOs may be granted to employees, consultants or Board members at an option price not less
                  than the fair market value of the common stock subject to the stock option agreement. Shares issued in connection with the exercise of stock options or the vesting of RSUs are newly issued shares.

For the years ended December 31,
                  2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted options to purchase an aggregate of 
1,531,635
, 
1,826,380
 and 
1,194,032

                  shares, respectively, of common stock to employees and directors under the 2022 Equity Plan and 2014 Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2024, options to purchase 
2,020,142
 shares of common stock were exercised, for which 
32,076

                  shares were withheld to cover the aggregate exercise prices and payroll taxes, and the Company received aggregate net exercise proceeds of $
7.5

                  million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, options to purchase 
3,814,122
 shares of common stock were exercised, for
                  which 
2,109,722
 shares were withheld to cover the aggregate exercise prices and 
259,867
 shares were withheld to cover payroll taxes, and the Company received aggregate net exercise proceeds of $
1.1
 million.

The fair value of
                stock options granted was determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options, which have no vesting
                restrictions and are fully transferable. The Company’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and changes in the underlying Black-Scholes assumptions can materially affect the fair
                value estimate. To determine the risk-free interest rate, the Company utilized the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant with a term consistent with the term of the awards granted by the Company. The expected term of
                all options granted is in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletins 107 and 110, which is based on the average between vesting terms and contractual terms as the Company had a limited history of option exercises prior to the middle of
                fiscal 2023. The expected dividend yield reflects the Company’s current and expected future policy for dividends on the Company’s common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the expected stock price volatility for
                the Company’s stock options was calculated by examining the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock since the stock became publicly traded in the fourth quarter of 2013.

one
 of the Company’s non-employee directors received modifications to their outstanding stock option and RSU awards in connection with their departure from the Company or

          Financial Officer and General Manager, ADMA BioCenters, whereby Mr. Lenz’s outstanding equity awards were modified in connection with his transition to a consulting role. Under the terms of the consulting agreement, Mr. Lenz remained eligible to
          participate in the Company’s equity compensation plans with respect to continued vesting of the subject awards as set forth in the agreement. In addition, the post-termination exercise period for Mr. Lenz’s vested stock options was extended from

90 days
 to 
two years

          from the date of the consulting agreement (or earlier, if such options’ 
10-year
 expiration date occurs sooner than 
March 31, 2026
). In connection with this modification, the Company recorded $
1.6
 million of additional compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

General Legal Matters

From time to time the Company is or may become subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising in connection with the normal
          course of its business. Management does not expect that the outcome of any such claims or actions will have a material effect on the Company’s liquidity, results of operations or financial condition.

IT Systems Disruption

On June 19, 2023, the Company experienced an IT systems disruption, which rendered certain of the Company’s IT technology
          systems inaccessible for less than 
one
 week. The Company’s investigation of the disruption has essentially been completed with the
          assistance of third-party consultants, and no definitive root cause was identified. At the time of the disruption, the Company was in production of 
two

          batches of BIVIGAM, and after a prolonged hold time, it was deemed to be a prudent GMP quality decision to discard these 
two

          in-process production batches as these batches were no longer viable for further production or had any alternative use. As a result, the Company recorded a one-time, non-recurring charge of $
2.1
 million in the second quarter of 2023 for this inventory, which is reflected in Cost of product revenue in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ending
          December 31, 2023. In addition, the Company’s Plasma center operating expenses were adversely impacted by approximately $
0.7
 million
          due to the temporary closing of the Company’s plasma collection centers while their IT systems were restored.

 The Company carries appropriate insurance for these types of instances. During each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and
          2023, the Company’s cybersecurity insurer paid the Company an aggregate of $
0.2
 million for approved restoration-related costs. 
          During the first quarter of 2025, the Company’s cybersecurity insurer paid the Company $
0.4
 million in business interruption loss
          coverage.

Vendor Commitments

Pursuant to the terms of a Plasma Purchase Agreement dated as of November 17, 2011 (the “2011 Plasma Purchase Agreement”), the Company
          agreed to purchase from its former contract manufacturer an annual minimum volume of source plasma containing antibodies to RSV to be used in the manufacture of ASCENIV. The Company must purchase a to-be-determined and agreed upon annual minimum
          volume from the counterparty, and under the original 2011 Plasma Purchase Agreement the Company was permitted to also collect high-titer plasma from up to 
five
 wholly-owned ADMA plasma collection facilities. During 2015, the Company amended the 2011 Plasma Purchase Agreement to (i) allow the Company to collect its raw material high-titer
          plasma from any number of wholly-owned ADMA plasma collection facilities and (ii) allow the Company to purchase its raw material high-titer plasma from other third-party collection organizations, in each case, provided that the annual minimum
          volumes from the Company’s former contract manufacturer were met, thus allowing the Company to expand its reach for raw material supply as it executes its commercialization plans for ASCENIV. On December 10, 2018, the Company’s former contract
          manufacturer assigned its rights and obligations under the 2011 Plasma Purchase Agreement to Grifols Worldwide Operations Limited (“Grifols”) as its successor-in-interest, effective January 1, 2019. Effective October 1, 2024, the Company entered
          into an Amended and Restated Plasma Purchase Agreement with Grifols (the “A&R Grifols Agreement”) with a term expiring in 
September 2039
,
          after which it may be renewed for 
two
 additional multi-year periods if agreed to by the parties. Pursuant to the A&R Grifols
          Agreement, Grifols supplies, on a non-exclusive basis, to ADMA BioManufacturing a minimum of 
35,000
 liters of RSV plasma annually to
          be used in the manufacture of ASCENIV, with an escalating price per liter depending on the volume supplied in a given 
12-month
 period,
          with a minimum annual price increase every 
12 months
.  Additionally, Grifols will be entitled to receive a fixed bonus payment in the
          event that a specified liter amount of high-titer plasma is supplied to the Company in any 
12-month
 period during the term of the
          A&R Grifols Agreement.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Effective August 6, 2024, the Company entered into a Plasma Purchase Agreement with KEDPlasma LLC (“KEDPlasma”) with a term expiring in 
July 2031
, after which it may be renewed for an additional 
five-year
 period if agreed to by the parties (the “KEDPlasma Agreement”).  Pursuant to the KEDPlasma Agreement, KEDPlasma supplies, on a non-exclusive basis, to ADMA BioManufacturing a minimum of 
35,000
 liters of RSV plasma annually commencing with the 
12-month

          period ending July 31, 2026, with an escalating price per liter depending on the volume supplied in a given 
12-month
 period. The price
          per liter of high-titer plasma supplied pursuant to the KEDPlasma Agreement is also scheduled to increase on an annual basis. Additionally, KEDPlasma will be entitled to receive a fixed bonus payment in the event that a specified liter amount of
          RSV plasma is supplied to the Company in any 
12-month
 period during the term of the KEDPlasma Agreement. 

On June 6, 2017, the Company entered into a Plasma Supply Agreement with its former contract manufacturer, pursuant to which the counterparty supplies, on an exclusive basis subject to certain exceptions, to ADMA BioManufacturing an annual
          minimum volume of hyperimmune plasma that contain antibodies to the Hepatitis B virus for the manufacture of Nabi-HB. The Plasma Supply Agreement has a 
10-year

          term. On July 19, 2018, 
the Plasma Supply Agreement was amended to provide, among other things, that in the event the counterparty elects not to supply in excess of ADMA BioManufacturing’s
            specified amount of Hepatitis B plasma and ADMA BioManufacturing is unable to secure Hepatitis B plasma from a third party at a price that is within a low double- digit percentage of the price that ADMA BioManufacturing pays to the
            counterparty, then the counterparty shall reimburse ADMA BioManufacturing for the difference in price ADMA BioManufacturing incurs. On December 10, 2018, the Company’s former contract manufacturer assigned its rights and obligations under the
            Plasma Supply Agreement to Grifols, effective January 1, 201

Post-Marketing Commitments

 In connection with the FDA approval of ASCENIV on April 1, 2019, the Company is required to perform a pediatric study to evaluate the
          safety and efficacy of ASCENIV in children and adolescents, for which patient enrollment has been successfully completed. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred expenses related to this study in the amount of $
1.2
 million, $
1.0
 million and $
0.5
 million, respectively. The Company expects to incur expenses of approximately $
1.0
 million to complete this study, which is required to be completed by June of 2026.

 In connection with the FDA approval of the BLA for BIVIGAM on December 19, 2012, Biotest committed to perform two additional
          post-marketing studies, a pediatric study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BIVIGAM in children and adolescents, and a post-authorization safety study to further assess the potential risk of hypotension and hepatic and renal impairment in
          BIVIGAM-treated patients with primary humoral immunodeficiency. These studies were required to be completed by June 30, 2023. Both studies have been completed and the study reports have been submitted to the FDA. ADMA had assumed the remaining
          obligations, and the costs of the studies were expensed as incurred as research and development expenses. The Company did 
no
t incur
          any expenses related to this commitment for the year ended December 31, 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred expenses related to these studies of $
1.7
 million and $
2.2
 million, respectively.

Other Commitments

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications with its employees, licensors, suppliers and service
            providers. Further, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers who are, or were, serving at the Company’s request in such capacities. The Company’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as of December 31, 2024. The
            Company does not anticipate recognizing any significant losses relating to these arrangements.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company has federal and state (post-apportioned basis) net operating losses (“NOLs”) of $
265.6
 million and $
204.0
 million, respectively. Approximately
            $
33.4
 million and $
62.0

            million of the foregoing Federal and state NOLs, respectively, will expire at various dates from 
2029
 through 
2043
, if not limited by triggering events prior to such time. 
Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, changes in ownership of the
          Company, in certain circumstances, would limit the amount of federal NOLs that can be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income. In particular, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 382”) imposes limitations on an
          entity’s ability to use NOLs upon certain changes in ownership. If the Company is limited in its ability to use its NOLs in future years in which it has taxable income, then the Company will pay more taxes than if it were otherwise able to fully
          utilize its NOLs. The Company may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in ownership of the Company’s capital stock that the Company cannot predict or control that could result in further limitations being
          placed on the Company’s ability to utilize its Federal NOLs. 
The annual amount of Federal NOLs that expire each year is as follows (in thousands):

A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. When determining the amount of net
          deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, the Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and
          carry-forward periods and the feasibility of ongoing tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent
          the evidence may be objectively verified.

ADMA BIOLOGICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 As of December 31, 2024, the Company believes it is more-likely-than-not that the Company’s federal and state deferred tax assets will be
          realized. The Company recorded a release of its valuation allowance associated with federal and state deferred tax assets which was due in part to achieving three years of cumulative taxable income and projected taxable income that is more than
          adequate to realize the Company’s federal and state deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company reversed the federal and state valuation allowance recorded as of December 31, 2023 of $
88.0
 million and $
13.4
 million, respectively, resulting in a
          tax benefit to the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2024.

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company is required to determine whether a tax position of the Company is more likely than not to be
          sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount
          of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Derecognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in the Company recording a tax liability that would reduce net assets. The amount of the
          liability for which an exposure exists is measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position. Components
          of the liability are classified as either a current or a long-term liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on when the Company expects each of the items to be settled. The Company does 
no
t have any unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and does not anticipate a significant change in unrecognized tax benefits
          during the next 12 months. 

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions. All net operating losses and tax credits
          generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. The Company’s income tax returns are open to examination for tax years 2007 through 2023.

LEASE OBLIGATIONS

The Company leases certain properties and equipment for its ADMA BioCenters and ADMA BioManufacturing subsidiaries, which leases provide
          the right to use the underlying assets and require lease payments through the respective lease terms which expire at various dates through 2033. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material
          restrictive covenants. Upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, 
Leases (Topic 842)
 effective January 1, 2019, the Company elected the package of practical expedients, which permits the Company to not reassess
          under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. In addition, the Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, 

The Company determines if an arrangement is an operating lease or a financing lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on
            the balance sheet and lease expense for such leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. All other leases are recorded on the balance sheet with assets representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease
            term and lease liabilities representing the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the
            lease term and include options to extend or terminate the lease when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. The present value of the lease payments is determined using the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate as of the lease
            commencement date. There were no new material leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2024. For the lease liabilities recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company used discount rates of 
13
% to 
16
%, representing a weighted
            average discount rate of 
13.02
%, to determine the present value of its lease obligations. The Company’s operating lease expense is
            recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is reflected in Plasma center operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Aggregate lease expense for
            the Company’s operating leases for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
2.4
 million, $
2.4
 million and 
$
2.1
 million
, respectively. Aggregate
            cash paid on these leases for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
2.4
 million, $
2.4
 million and $
1.8
 million,
            respectively.

SEGMENTS

The Company is engaged in the manufacture, marketing and development of specialty plasma-derived biologics.  The Company’s ADMA
          BioManufacturing operating segment reflects the Company’s immunoglobulin manufacturing, commercial and development operations in Boca Raton, FL.  The Plasma Collection Centers operating segment consists of 
ten
 plasma collection facilities located throughout the United States, all of which are operational, collecting plasma and currently holding FDA
          licenses. The Company defines its operating segments as those business units whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Corporate information
          included in the reconciliations below generally consists of certain unallocated general and administrative overhead expenses and interest expense on the Company’s senior debt (see Note 7). The Company’s CODM is its President and Chief Executive
          Officer. For the Company’s two operating segments, the CODM uses income/loss before taxes as the measure of segment profit to determine the allocation of resources for each segment. Transactions between the 
two
 operating segments consist solely of the transfer of raw material plasma inventory at cost from the Plasma Collection Centers segment to the ADMA
          BioManufacturing segment with no markup or intercompany profit. Income tax benefit/expense is recorded at the Corporate entity and is not allocated to the operating segments. 
Summarized financial information concerning reportable segments is
