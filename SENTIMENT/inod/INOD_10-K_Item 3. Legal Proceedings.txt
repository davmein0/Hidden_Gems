For a summary of our Significant Accounting Estimates and Policies, please refer to Note 1 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included elsewhere in this Report.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP (“GAAP”), we provide certain non-GAAP financial information. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results. In some respects, management believes non-GAAP financial measures are more indicative of our ongoing core operating performance than their GAAP equivalents by making adjustments that management believes are reflective of the ongoing performance of the business.
We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial information provides investors with greater transparency by providing investors a more complete understanding of our financial performance, competitive position, and prospects for the future, particularly by providing the same information that management and our Board of Directors use to evaluate our performance and manage the business. However, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures that we present may differ from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin
We define Adjusted Gross Profit as revenues less direct operating costs attributable to Innodata Inc. and its subsidiaries in accordance with U.S. GAAP, plus depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, non-recurring severance and other one-time costs. 
31

Table of Contents
We define Adjusted Gross Margin by dividing Adjusted Gross Profit over total U.S. GAAP revenues. 
We use Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin to evaluate results of operations and trends between fiscal periods and believe that these measures are important components of our internal performance measurement process. 
The following table contains a reconciliation of Gross Profit and Gross Margin in accordance with the U.S. GAAP attributable to Innodata Inc. and its subsidiaries to Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands).

Adjusted EBITDA
We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to Innodata Inc. and its subsidiaries in accordance with U.S. GAAP before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets (which derives EBITDA), plus additional adjustments for loss on impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, stock-based compensation, income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, non-recurring severance, and other one-time costs. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate core results of operations and trends between fiscal periods and believe that these measures are important components of our internal performance measurement process.

Direct operating costs were $103.4 million and $55.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $47.9 million or approximately 86%. The cost increase was primarily due to increased headcount to support higher volumes from an existing customer.

Direct operating costs as a percentage of total revenues were approximately 61% and 64% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in direct operating cost as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to higher revenues in all segments and lower direct operating costs in the Synodex segment, offset in part by higher direct operating costs in the DDS and Agility segments.

The decrease in direct operating costs was primarily due to the effect of our cost optimization initiatives completed in 2023 which resulted in cost efficiencies for the Synodex segment. The reduction was primarily due to lower direct labor costs of $0.9 million and lower depreciation and amortization of capitalized developed software of $0.1 million, offset in part by higher cloud service subscriptions of $0.1 million. Direct operating costs for the Synodex segment as a percentage of segment revenues were approximately 73% and 89% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in direct operating costs of the Synodex segment as a percentage of Synodex segment revenues was due to a decrease in direct operating costs and higher revenues.
Direct operating costs for the Agility segment were approximately $9.4 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $0.7 million or approximately 8%. The increase was primarily due to higher content costs of $0.8 million, higher depreciation and amortization of capitalized developed software of $0.2 million, offset in part by lower direct labor costs of $0.2 million including severance, primarily due to the effect of our cost optimization initiatives completed in 2023 and a favorable impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations of $0.1 million.

It involved a quantitative goodwill impairment test and estimated the fair value based on a combination of the income approach (estimates of future discounted cash flows) and the market approach (market multiples for similar companies) using unobservable inputs (Level 3). The income approach uses a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method that utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate the segment’s fair value. The future cash flows of the segment were projected based on the Company’s estimates of future revenues, operating income, and other factors such as working capital and capital expenditure. As part of the DCF analysis, the Company projected revenue and operating profits and assumed long-term revenue growth rates in the terminal year. The market approach utilizes multiples of revenues and earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) to estimate the segment’s fair value. The market multiples used for the segment were based on a group of comparable companies’ market multiples applied to the Company’s revenue. The Company concluded that there is no impairment of goodwill.
Income Taxes
Income taxes primarily consist of a provision for foreign taxes recorded by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries in accordance with local tax regulations.

Table of Contents
We recorded a benefit from income taxes of $4.2 million and provision for income taxes of approximately $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the third and fourth quarters of 2024, the Company determined it was more likely than not that the Company would be able to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets in the United States and the United Kingdom, resulting in the release of the valuation allowance. In reaching this determination, the Company considered the growing trend of profitability over the last three years in the United States, as well as its expectations regarding the generation of future taxable income.
The effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2024 are disproportionate primarily due to the effect of a stock-based compensation adjustment, the release of the valuation allowance from our U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits, offset in part by IRS section 162 (m) adjustments and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) provisions.
The effective income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2023 are disproportionate primarily due to the minimal pre-tax income and valuation allowance recorded on the deferred taxes of the U.S., Canadian, German and the U.K. subsidiaries, tax effects of foreign operations, IRS section 162 (m) adjustments, offset in part by the effect of stock-based compensation.
The reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate with the Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are summarized in the table below:

Despite access to overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, we intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings and profits in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes that we would have to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted foreign earnings and profits amounted to approximately $53.9 million at December 31, 2024. If such foreign earnings and profits are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances.
We have a remaining valuation allowance on all the deferred tax assets of our Canadian and German subsidiaries. Our Canadian subsidiaries also have research and development credits available to reduce taxable income in future years, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes.

Net Income (Loss)
We had a net income of $28.7 million and a net loss of $0.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $29.6 million change was a result of higher revenues in all segments and lower direct operating costs and selling and administrative expenses in the Synodex segment, offset in part by higher direct operating costs and selling and administrative expenses in the DDS and Agility segments of $24.1 million; a change in income tax provision resulting from the release of the valuation allowance on our U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets of $5.4 million and interest income of $0.1 million from the refund of a court fee deposit for our Indian subsidiary’s service tax case for the current fiscal year.
Net income for the DDS segment was $25.4 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $25.2 million increase was primarily attributable to higher revenues, offset in part by higher direct operating costs and selling and administrative expenses of $19.8 million; a change in income tax provision resulting from the release of the valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets of $5.3 million and interest income of $0.1 million from the refund of a court fee deposit for our Indian subsidiary’s service tax case for the current fiscal year. 
Net income for the Synodex segment was $1.9 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $1.7 million increase was primarily due to lower direct operating costs and selling and administrative expenses and higher revenues in the current fiscal year. 
Net income for the Agility segment was $1.3 million and a net loss of $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $2.6 million change was due to higher revenues offset in part by higher direct operating costs and selling and administrative expenses of $2.5 million and a change in income tax provision resulting from the release of the valuation allowance on our United Kingdom subsidiary’s deferred tax assets of $0.1 million in the current fiscal year.
Adjusted Gross Profit and Margin
Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, please see the description of “Non-GAAP Financial Measures – Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin” above.
Adjusted gross profit was $73.1 million and $36.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $36.6 million increase in adjusted gross profit was primarily due to higher revenues in all segments and lower direct operating costs for the Synodex segment, offset in part by higher direct operating costs in the DDS and Agility segments. Adjusted gross margin was 43% and 42% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in adjusted gross margin was primarily due to higher revenues in all segments and lower direct operating costs for the Synodex segment, offset in part by higher direct operating costs in the DDS and Agility segments in the current fiscal year.
Adjusted gross profit for the DDS segment was $55.3 million and $22.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $32.4 million increase in adjusted gross profit for the DDS segment was due to higher revenues, offset in part by higher direct operating costs. Adjusted gross margin for the DDS segment was 39% and 37% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the adjusted gross margin for the DDS segment as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher revenues, offset in part by higher direct operating costs in the current fiscal year.
Adjusted gross profit for the Synodex segment was $2.6 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $1.2 million increase in adjusted gross profit in the Synodex segment was due to lower direct operating costs and higher revenues. Adjusted gross margin for the Synodex segment was 33% and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the adjusted gross margin for the Synodex segment as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to lower direct operating costs and higher revenues in the current fiscal year.

Adjusted gross profit for the Agility segment was $15.2 million and $12.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $3.0 million increase in adjusted gross profit for the Agility segment was due to higher revenues, offset in part by higher direct operating costs. Adjusted gross margin for the Agility segment was 71% and 69% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the adjusted gross margin for the Agility segment as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to higher revenues, offset in part by higher direct operating costs in the current fiscal year.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, please see the description of “Non-GAAP Financial Measures – Adjusted EBITDA” above.
Adjusted EBITDA was $34.6 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $24.7 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA was due to higher net income, higher depreciation and amortization, offset in part by a change in income tax provision resulting from the release of the valuation allowance on our U.S. and United Kingdom deferred tax assets, and lower non-recurring severance in the current fiscal year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the DDS segment was $27.8 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $21.4 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA in the DDS Segment was due to higher net income, higher depreciation and amortization, offset in part by a change in income tax provision for the period resulting from the release of the valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the current fiscal year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the Synodex segment was $2.3 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $1.3 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA in the Synodex segment was due to higher net income, offset in part by lower stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization in the current fiscal year. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the Agility segment was $4.5 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The $2.0 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA in the Agility segment was due to the net income in the current period compared to the net loss in the comparative period, higher depreciation and amortization, offset in part by lower non-recurring severance, lower stock-based compensation and a change in income tax provision for the period resulting from the release of the valuation allowance on our United Kingdom deferred tax assets in the current fiscal year.

On December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $46.9 million, of which $17.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and $29.0 million was held in the United States. Despite the passage of the new tax law under which we may repatriate funds from overseas after paying the toll charge, it is our intent, as of December 31, 2024, to indefinitely reinvest the overseas funds in our foreign subsidiaries due to the withholding tax that we would have to incur on the actual remittances.
40

Table of Contents
We have used, and plan to use, our cash and cash equivalents for (i) capital investments; (ii) the expansion of our operations; (iii) technology innovation; (iv) product management and strategic marketing; (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital; and (vi) possible business acquisitions. As of December 31, 2024, we had working capital of approximately $41.5 million, as compared to working capital of approximately $9.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in working capital of $32.4 million is primarily due to higher cash balances driven by collections from higher revenues and cash proceeds from stock option exercises of $6.7 million. Accounts receivable increased by $12.9 million compared to the prior year as of the year ended December 31, 2024.
Proceeds from stock option exercises for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $6.7 million.
We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2024. 
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy our financial needs for at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements.
On April 4, 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as lender, and Innodata Inc., Innodata Synodex, LLC, Innodata docGenix, LLC and Agility PR Solutions LLC as co-borrowers. On July 21, 2023, Innodata Services, LLC signed a Joinder Agreement to join the Credit Agreement as a co-borrower. On August 5, 2024, we entered into a second amendment (to the Credit Agreement (together with the Credit Agreement, the “Amended Credit Agreement”). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a secured revolving line of credit (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) up to an amount equal to the lesser of the borrowing base and $30.0 million (the “Maximum Credit”) and provides that a Borrower may request an increase to the Revolving Credit Facility’s Maximum Credit of up to, but not to exceed, $50.0 million, subject to the approval of the Lender. The Revolving Credit Facility’s borrowing base is calculated on the basis of (i) 85% of eligible accounts (other than eligible foreign accounts and unbilled accounts), plus (ii) the lesser of (a) 80% of eligible accounts that are unbilled accounts and (b) 30% of all eligible accounts, plus (iii) the lesser of (a) 85% of eligible foreign accounts, (b) 20% of all eligible accounts and (c) $4.0 million, minus (iv) certain other reserves and adjustments. As of December 31, 2024, such borrowing base calculation equaled approximately $22.3 million. The Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires the Borrowers, on a consolidated basis, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10 to 1.00. Except as set forth in the Credit Agreement, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the daily simple secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus 2.25%. We did not utilize the Revolving Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2024 or during the subsequent period through the filing date of this Report.
On August 8, 2024, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-281379) (the “Form S-3”) with the SEC. The Form S-3, which includes a base prospectus, allows us to offer and sell, from time to time, in one or more offerings, common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants or units up to an aggregate public offering price of $50.0 million. On September 16, 2024 we filed Amendment No. 1 to the Form S-3. The Form S-3 was declared effective by the SEC on October 10, 2024. The Form S-3 is intended to preserve our flexibility to raise capital from time to time, if and when needed.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $35.0 million resulting from our net income of $28.7 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $6.2 million and an increase in working capital of $0.1 million. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details.
Cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $5.9 million resulting from our net loss of $0.9 million, adjusted for non-cash expenses of $9.9 million and a decrease in working capital of $3.1 million. Refer to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Table of Contents
Our days’ sales outstanding were 45 days and 50 days for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We calculate DSO by first dividing the total revenues for the period by average net accounts receivable, which is the average of net accounts receivable at the beginning of the period and net accounts receivable at the end of the period, to yield an amount we refer to as the “accounts receivable turnover”. Then we divide the total number of days within the period reported by the accounts receivable turnover to yield DSO expressed in number of days.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash used in our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $7.7 million. These capital expenditures were principally for the purchase of technology equipment including servers, network infrastructure and workstations, and expenditures for capitalized developed software. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted of $4.6 million for the DDS segment, $2.1 million for the Agility segment and $1.0 million for the Synodex segment. 
Cash used in our investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $5.1 million consisting of capital expenditures of $5.6 million offset in part by proceeds from sale of investments of $0.5 million. These capital expenditures were principally for the purchase of technology equipment including servers, network infrastructure and workstations, and expenditures for capitalized developed software. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2024 amounting to $5.6 million consisted of $2.9 million for the DDS segment, $1.8 million for the Agility segment and $0.9 million for the Synodex segment. 
For calendar year 2025, we anticipate that capital expenditures for ongoing technology, equipment, new platform development, and infrastructure upgrades will approximate to $11.0 million, a portion of which we may finance.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $6.1 million, primarily from proceeds of stock option exercises of $6.7 million, offset in part by payment of long-term obligations of $0.5 million and withholding taxes on net settlement of restricted stock awards of $0.1 million.
Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2.9 million primarily from proceeds of stock option exercises of $3.3 million, offset in part by payment of long-term obligations of $0.4 million.
Inflation, Seasonality and Prevailing Economic Conditions
Although most of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenue is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros. In addition, a significant portion of our expenses, primarily labor expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Germany, Canada and Israel, are incurred in the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. For financial reporting purposes, we translate all non-U.S. denominated transactions into U.S. dollars in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Thus, we are exposed to the risk that fluctuations in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a direct impact on our revenues and our results of operations. 
The Philippines and India have at times experienced high rates of inflation as well as major fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Philippine peso and the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar. Canada has also experienced fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate notional amount of our hedges was $22.5 million consisting of approximately $10.7 million against the Canadian dollar, $6.7 million against the Philippine peso and $5.1 million against the Indian rupee. 
Fluctuations in exchange rates also affect the value of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries. We do not currently intend to hedge these assets.

Table of Contents
Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits of our employees. We are exposed to high inflation in wage rates in the countries in which we operate. We generally perform work for our customers under project-specific contracts, requirements-based contracts or long-term contracts. We must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed-price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services to our customers. 
Our quarterly operating results are subject to certain fluctuations. We experience fluctuations in our revenues and earnings as we replace and begin new projects, which may have some normal start-up delays, or we may be unable to replace a project entirely. These and other factors may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, as some of our Asian facilities are closed during holidays in the fourth quarter, we typically incur higher wages, due to overtime, that reduces our margins. 
Our Synodex subsidiary experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues. Typically, revenue is lowest in the third quarter of the calendar year and highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. The seasonality is directly linked to the number of life insurance applications received by the insurance companies.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management and director authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. 
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) -

This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Shareholders and Board of Directors
Innodata Inc.
Ridgefield Park, New Jersey
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innodata Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Measurement of the provision for income tax expenses
Description of Matter
The Company is subject to income taxes in multiple tax jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain due to complexities of transfer pricing, changing tax laws, and is involved in various tax litigations with respective tax authorities. Uncertainties arise primarily from certain ongoing tax litigations and open tax years for its foreign subsidiaries. As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2024, the Company has recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $1.0 million for uncertain tax positions.
We identified measurement of accruals for the income tax exposures as a critical audit matter, as the amounts involved are material, and the determination of provision for taxes requires the Company to make judgments on tax issues and develop estimates regarding the Company’s exposure to tax risks. Further, auditing management judgments on whether the tax positions are probable of being sustained in tax assessments involves a high degree of subjectivity.
How the matter was addressed in our audit:
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
●
Obtaining an understanding of management’s process of estimating the provision for income taxes including assessment of uncertain tax positions and those related to interpretation of tax laws and its application in the estimation of tax liabilities including uncertain tax positions.
●
Testing the completeness of ongoing tax litigation by obtaining direct confirmations from external tax consultants for select geographies. Also tested the arithmetical accuracy of various computation.
●
Involving tax professionals with specialized skill and knowledge in domestic and international taxes, who assisted in:
●
Reviewing and evaluating the Company’s data including assumptions used to determine the amount of tax benefit/expense to be recognized and tested the accuracy of the calculations
●
inspecting the correspondences and assessment orders with applicable tax authorities
●
evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax laws, underlying facts and their potential impact on uncertain tax positions.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
1.          Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Estimates and Policies 
Description of Business
 - Innodata Inc. (Nasdaq: INOD) (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a leading data engineering company. The Company’s mission is to help the world’s most prestigious companies deliver the promise of ethical, high-performing artificial intelligence (“AI”), which the Company believes will contribute to a safer and more prosperous world.
The Company was founded on a simple idea: engineer the highest quality data so organizations across broad industry segments could make smarter decisions. Today, the Company believes it is delivering the highest quality data for some of the world’s most innovative technology companies to use to train the AI models of the future.
AI holds the promise that computers can perceive and understand the world, enabling products and services that would have been previously unimaginable and impossible with traditional coding. AI learns from data, and the highest-performing AI will have learned from the highest-quality data. The Company believes that it can contribute meaningfully by harnessing its capabilities, honed over 35+ years, in collecting and annotating data at scale with consistency and high accuracy.
The Company is also helping companies deploy and integrate AI into their operations and products and providing innovative AI-enabled industry platforms, helping ensure that its customers’ businesses are prepared for a world in which machines augment human activity in ways previously unimaginable. 
The Company developed its capabilities and honed its approaches progressively over the last 35+ years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately nine years ago, the Company formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to its large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, the Company began packaging the capabilities that emerged from its R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights.
The Company’s historical core competency in high-quality data, combined with these R&D efforts in applied AI, created the foundation for the evolution of the Company’s offerings, which include AI Data Preparation, AI Model Deployment and Integration, and AI-Enabled Industry Platforms.
AI Data Preparation
For several of the world’s large technology companies, the Company supports their efforts at building generative AI foundation models. For these companies, the Company provides or is poised to provide a range of scaled data solutions and services. The Company’s scaled data solutions include providing instruction data sets for fine-tuning LLMs to understand prompts, to accept instruction, to converse, to apparently reason, and to perform the myriad of incredible feats that many of us have now experienced. The Company also provides reinforcement learning and reward modeling, services which are critical to provide the guardrails against toxic, bias and harmful responses, and model evaluation services. 
For social media companies, financial services companies, and many others, the Company collects or creates training data, annotates training data, and trains AI algorithms for working with images, text, video, audio, code and sensor data.

In addition, because collecting real-world data is often impracticable (due to data privacy regulations or rarity of cohorts and outliers), the Company creates high-quality synthetic data that maintains all of the statistical properties of real-world data, using a combination of domain specialists and machine technologies that leverage large language models (LLMs).
AI Model Deployment and Integration
The Company helps businesses leverage the latest AI technologies to achieve their goals. The Company develops custom AI models (where it selects the appropriate algorithms, tunes hyperparameters, trains and validates the models, and updates the models as required). The Company also helps businesses fine-tune their own custom versions of the Company’s proprietary models and third-party foundation models to address domain-specific and customer-specific use cases.
For the Company’s customers that provide products and solutions that require intensive text data processing and analytics, in addition to deploying and integrating AI models, the Company often provides a range of data engineering support services including data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data extraction, data compliance, and master data management.
The Company’s customers span a diverse range of industries and a wide range of AI use cases, benefiting from the short time-to-value and high economic returns of the Company’s AI solutions and platforms.
AI-Enabled Industry Platforms
The Company’s AI-enabled industry platforms address specific, niche market requirements the Company believes it can innovate with AI/ML technologies. The Company deploys these industry platforms as software-as-a-service (SaaS) and as managed services. These platforms benefit from the Company’s technology infrastructure, its industry-specific knowledge, its strong customer relationships and experience merging technology with the business processes of its customers. To date, the Company has built an industry platform for medical records data extraction and transformation (which the Company brands as “Synodex
®
”) and an industry platform for public relations (which the Company brands as “Agility PR Solutions”). The Company is in development with an additional AI-enabled industry platform to serve financial services institutions.
The Company’s Synodex industry platform transforms medical records into useable digital data organized in accordance with its proprietary data models or customer data models. 
The Company’s Agility industry platform provides marketing communications and public relations professionals with the ability to target and distribute content to journalists and social media influencers world-wide and to monitor and analyze global news (print, web, radio and TV) and social media.
The Company’s operations are presently classified and reported in 
three
 reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility.
Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
The non-controlling interests in the docGenix limited liability company at December 31, 2023 had call and put options that can be settled in cash or stock. Accordingly, this is presented in temporary equity in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) non-controlling interest guidance. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates 
- In preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those related to the allowance for credit losses and billing adjustments, useful life of long-lived assets, useful life of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, valuation of deferred tax assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, pension benefit plan assumptions, litigation accruals and estimated accruals for various tax exposures.
Revenue Recognition 
- The Company’s revenue is recognized when services are rendered or goods are delivered to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services or goods as per the agreement with the customer. In cases where there are agreements with multiple performance obligations, the Company identifies each performance obligation and evaluates whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the agreement at the agreement’s inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at agreement inception are combined. For agreements with distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation proportionately based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation, if any, and then evaluates how the services are performed for the customer to determine the timing of revenue recognition.
For the Digital Data Solutions (DDS) segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered or resources utilized in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. Revenue from agreements billed on a time-and-materials basis is recognized as services are performed. Revenue from fixed-fee agreements, which is not significant to overall revenues, is recognized based on the proportional performance method of accounting, as services are performed, or milestones are achieved.
For the Synodex segment, revenue is recognized primarily based on the quantity delivered in the period in which services are performed and performance conditions are satisfied as per the agreement. A portion of the Synodex segment revenue is derived from licensing the Company’s functional software and providing access to the Company’s hosted software platform. Revenue from such services is recognized monthly when all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; access to the service is provided to the end user; and collection is probable.
The Agility segment derives its revenue primarily from subscription arrangements and provision of enriched media analysis services. It also derives revenue as a reseller of corporate communication solutions. Revenue from subscriptions is recognized monthly when access to the service is provided to the end user; all parties to the agreement have agreed to the agreement; each party’s rights are identifiable; the payment terms are identifiable; the agreement has commercial substance; and collection is probable. Revenue from enriched media analysis services is recognized when the services are performed, and performance conditions are satisfied. Revenue from the reseller agreements is recognized at the gross amount received for the goods in accordance with the Company functioning as a principal due to the Company meeting the following criteria: the Company acts as the primary obligor in the sales transaction; assumes the credit risk; sets the price; can select suppliers; and is involved in the execution of the services, including after sales service.
Revenue associated with the services provided in one period and billed in a subsequent period is commonly referred to as unbilled revenues and is included under Accounts receivable.

The Company considers U.S. GAAP criteria for determining whether to report gross revenue as a principal versus net revenue as an agent. The Company evaluates whether it is in control of the services before the same are transferred to the customer to assess whether it is principal or agent in the arrangement.
Contract acquisition costs, which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, are amortized over the term of a subscription agreement or contract that normally has a duration of 
12 months
 or less. The Company reviews these prepaid acquisition costs on a periodic basis to determine the need to adjust the carrying values for early terminated contracts. Included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are contract acquisition costs amounting to $
1.1
 million and $
0.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. These acquisition costs relate to our Agility segment and are amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the subscription agreement.
Foreign Currency Translation 
- The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Israel, Hong Kong, the U.K. and Canada (other than the Agility subsidiaries) is the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in Philippine pesos, Indian and Sri Lankan rupees, Israeli shekels, U.K. pound sterling and Canadian dollars are translated to U.S. dollars at rates which approximate those in effect on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and all liabilities denominated in foreign currencies on December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of those dates. Non-monetary assets and stockholders’ equity are translated at the appropriate historical rates. Included in direct operating costs were foreign exchange (gains) losses resulting from such translations of approximately ($
0.2
) million and $
0.4
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The functional currency for the Company’s subsidiary in Germany is the Euro. The functional currencies for the Company’s Agility subsidiaries in the U.K. and Canada are the Pound Sterling and the Canadian dollar, respectively. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are prepared in their respective currencies. Financial information is translated from the applicable functional currency to the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency) for inclusion in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Income, expenses, and cash flows are translated at weighted-average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal period, and assets and liabilities are translated at fiscal period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders’ equity. Foreign exchange transaction gains or losses are included in direct operating costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Derivative Instruments - 
The Company accounts for derivative transactions in accordance with the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 825, “Financial Instruments”. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss). When the amounts recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings, they are included as part of Direct operating costs. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, any change in fair value is recorded directly in earnings as part of Direct operating costs. The total notional value of designated outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was $
22.5
 million and $
10.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Cash Equivalents - 
For financial statement purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Short term Investments-other - 
For financial statement purposes, the Company considers investments made in time deposits and treasury bills having an original maturity of more than three months but less than one year from the balance sheet date under short term investments.

Concentration of Credit Risk -
 The Company maintains its cash with highly rated financial institutions, located in the United States and in foreign locations where the Company has its operations. At December 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $
46.9
 million, of which $
17.9
 million was held by its foreign subsidiaries and $
29.0
 million was held in the United States. To the extent that such cash exceeds the maximum insurance levels, the Company is uninsured. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
Accounts Receivable -
 Accounts receivable is generally recorded at the invoiced amounts, net of an allowance for expected losses. The Company establishes credit terms for new customers based upon management’s review of their credit information and project terms, and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, adjusting credit terms when management believes appropriate based upon payment history and an assessment of the customer’s current creditworthiness.
We record an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make the required payments and provisions for billing adjustments relating to quality issues on delivered services. The allowance for credit losses is based on a review of specifically identified accounts and an overall aging analysis applied to accounts pooled based on similar risk characteristics. Judgments are made with respect to the collectability of accounts receivable within each pool based on historical experience, current payment practices, and current economic trends based on our expectations over the expected life of the receivables, generally ninety days or less. Actual credit losses could differ from those estimates.
Property and Equipment

- 
Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which is generally 
two
 to 
ten years
. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the leases. Certain assets under capital leases are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter.
Capitalized Developed Software - 
The Company incurs development costs related to software it develops for its internal use. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. These costs primarily consist of internal labor and third-party development costs and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the capitalized developed software, which generally ranges from 
three
 to 
ten years
. All other research and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized developed software in progress as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $
3.6
 million and $
3.5
 million, respectively. The cumulative completed capitalized developed software as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
19.8
 million and $
15.2
 million, respectively.
Long-lived Assets -
 Management assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The following factors, if present, may trigger an impairment review: (i) significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iii) significant decline in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period; and (iv) a change in the Company’s market capitalization relative to net book value. If the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above-mentioned factors, an impairment analysis is performed, using undiscounted cash flow projections. Management makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these respective assets. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

- 
The Company performs a valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on each acquisition accounted for as a business combination and allocates the purchase price of each acquired business to its respective net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Acquired intangible assets principally consist of technology, customer relationships, backlog and trademarks, having useful lives which range from 
ten
 to 
twelve years
. The Company determines the appropriate useful life by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on projected financial information of the acquired businesses. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method, which approximates the pattern in which the majority of the economic benefits are expected to be consumed. Intangible assets are amortized into direct operating costs ratably over their expected related revenue streams over their useful lives.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets. The Company does not amortize goodwill but evaluates it for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the third quarter of each fiscal year (as of September 30 of that year) or when an event occurs, or circumstances change, that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The Company performed its annual goodwill assessment for the Agility segment as of September 30, 2024 for impairment. The impairment test involves estimating the fair value based on a combination of income (estimates of future discounted cash flows) and the market approach (market multiples for similar companies) using unobservable inputs (Level 3). The Company concluded that there is 
no
 impairment of goodwill for the Agility segment.
Income Taxes 
- Estimated deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates, as well as any net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expected to reduce taxes payable in future years. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the estimated deferred tax assets will not be realized. While the Company considers future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event that the Company anticipates that it will be able to realize the estimated deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the provision for deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, in the event that the Company anticipates that it will not be able to realize the estimated deferred tax assets in the future considering future taxable income, an adjustment to the provision for deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made. Changes in the valuation allowance from period to period are included in the Company’s tax provision in the period of change. The Company indefinitely reinvests the foreign earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue as a liability the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances.
In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considered whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets of entities in the U.S., Canada, Germany and the U.K. will be realizable or not.
The Company’s assessment for the U.S. and the U.K. entities during the year ended December 31, 2024 yielded positive evidence enabling the release of the valuation allowance for the U.S. and the U.K. deferred tax assets under “ASC Topic 740-10-30-22 – Accounting for Income Taxes”.
As the expectation of future taxable income of the Canadian and German entities cannot be predicted with reasonable accuracy, the Company maintains a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of these entities.
The Company accounts for income taxes regarding uncertain tax positions, and recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Accounting for Leases 
-

Accounting Standards for Codifications (ASC 842 “Accounting for Leases”) requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets as liabilities, with corresponding “right-of-use” assets. The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for all its operating leases. See Note 8, Operating Leases.
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date and requires an assessment of whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets, or the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. A reassessment is made after inception of the lease only if one of the following applies:
a.
there is a change in contractual terms, other than a renewal or extension of the arrangement; 
b.
a renewal option is exercised, or extension granted, unless the term of the renewal or extension was initially included in the lease term; 
c.
there is a change in the determination of whether fulfillment is dependent on a specified asset; or 
d.
there is a substantial change to the asset. 
Whenever a reassessment is made, lease accounting shall commence or cease from the date when the change in circumstances gave rise to the reassessment for scenarios (a), (c) or (d) and at the date of renewal or extension period for scenario (b).
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. As of December 31, 2024, all of the Company’s leases are classified under operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -
 The Company measures and recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on the estimated fair value at the grant date. The stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period. The fair value of stock option grants is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of restricted stock units is determined using the Binomial option pricing model. For restricted stock units which are time vested, the fair value is determined based on the grant date fair value.
The stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s stock plans were allocated as follows (in thousands):

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
- The carrying amounts of financial instruments approximated their fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. See Note 16, Derivatives.
Fair value measurements and disclosures define fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.

Table of Contents
INNODATA INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023
The accounting standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels. The three levels are defined as follows:
●
Level 1
: Unadjusted quoted price in active market for identical assets and liabilities.
●
Level 2:
 Inputs other than those included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
●
Level 3:
 Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
The Company’s forward contracts are at level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Income (Loss) per Share 
- Income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income (loss) per share is computed by considering the impact of the potential issuance of common shares, using the treasury stock method, on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For those securities that are not convertible into a class of common stock, the “two class” method of computing income (loss) per share is used.
Pension - 
The Company records annual pension costs based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, compensation increases and other assumptions involving demographic factors. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. The Company believes that the assumptions used in recording its pension obligations are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and inputs from its actuaries.
Deferred Revenue 
- Deferred revenue represents payments received from customers in advance of providing services and amounts deferred if conditions for revenue recognition have not been met. We expect to recognize substantially all of these performance obligations over the next 12 months. The balance of deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets amounted to $
8.0
 million and $
3.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis on its reporting unit with goodwill, the Agility segment. It involved a quantitative goodwill impairment test and estimated the fair value based on a combination of the income approach (estimates of future discounted cash flows) and the market approach (market multiples for similar companies) using unobservable inputs (Level 3). The income approach uses a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method that utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate the segment’s fair value. The future cash flows of the segment were projected based on the Company’s estimates of future revenues, operating income, and other factors such as working capital and capital expenditures. As part of the DCF analysis, the Company projected revenue and operating profits and assumed long-term revenue growth rates in the terminal year. The market approach utilizes multiples of revenues and earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) to estimate the segment’s fair value. The market multiples used for the segment were based on a group of comparable companies’ market multiples applied to the Company’s revenue. The Company concluded that there is 
no
 impairment of goodwill.
The fair value measurement of goodwill for the Agility segment was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the Company used the income approach, which utilizes significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and the market multiple approach using comparable entities to further validate the carrying values. The Company believes it made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit as of the impairment test measurement date. The carrying value of goodwill was $
2.0
 million and $
2.1
 million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible and net operating losses are available. As of December 31, 2024, the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on all of the Company’s Canadian and German subsidiaries’ deferred tax assets.
The Company maintained a valuation allowance of approximately $
5.0
 million and $
13.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net change in the total valuation allowance was a decrease of $
8.8
 million and an increase of $
0.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
The change is due to the Company’s assessment during the third and fourth quarters of 2024, where the Company determined it was more likely than not that the Company would be able to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, resulting in the release of the valuation allowance. In reaching this determination, the Company considered the growing trend of profitability over the last three years in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as its expectations regarding the generation of future taxable income.
The remaining valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024 relates to the Company’s Canadian and German subsidiaries’ deferred tax assets.
Despite the access to the overseas earnings and the resulting toll charge, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings in our foreign subsidiaries on account of the foreign jurisdiction withholding tax that the Company has to incur on the actual remittances. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $
53.9
 million at December 31, 2024. If such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would have to accrue the applicable amount of foreign jurisdiction withholding taxes associated with such remittances.

At December 31, 2024, the Company had available U.S. federal & state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $
10.6
 million and $
6.5
M, respectively. The Company had research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $
0.1
 million. The Federal income tax NOL carryforwards expire at various times from the year 2034 through the year 2035 and the research and development credit expires in 2042. The state income tax NOL carryforwards begin expiring at various times starting in 2025. The deferred tax benefit for these NOL carryforwards and R&D credit carryforwards have been recognized for financial statement purposes.
Under the CARES Act, the Internal Revenue Code was amended to allow for federal NOL carrybacks for five years to offset previous years’ taxable income or for the NOL to be carried forward indefinitely to offset 80% of taxable income for tax years 2021 and thereafter. As of the date the financial statements were issued, the state NOL carryforwards, if not utilized, will expire beginning in 2025.
On December 31, 2024, the Company’s Agility subsidiary in the U.K. had available NOL carryforwards of approximately $
0.4
 million. The deferred tax benefit for these NOL carryforwards has been recognized for financial statement purposes.

On December 31, 2024, the Company’s Canadian subsidiaries had available Canadian NOL carryforwards of approximately $

 million that will begin to expire in 2037 and research and development credits of approximately $

 million that have no expiry. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes.
On December 31, 2024, the Company’s German subsidiary had available NOL carryforwards of approximately $
0.7
 million. The potential benefits from these balances have not been recognized for financial statement purposes.
The Company is subject to Federal income tax, as well as income tax in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has open tax years for U.S. Federal and state taxes from 2020 through 2024. Various foreign subsidiaries have open tax years from 2005 through 2024, some of which are under audit by local tax authorities. The Company believes that its accruals for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 under ASC 740, Income Taxes are adequate to cover the Company’s income tax exposures.

 million and $

 million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain due to complexities of tax laws. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits resulted from reversal of accruals of $
1.3
 million in unrecognized tax benefits for a subsidiary because the examination period for an open tax year had prescribed. The Company expects that unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, if recognized, would have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate.

7.          Commitments and contingencies 
Litigation - 
In 2008, a judgment was rendered in the Philippines against a Philippine subsidiary of the Company that is no longer active and purportedly also against Innodata Inc., in favor of certain former employees of the Philippine subsidiary. The potential payment amount aggregates to approximately $
5.6
 million, 
plus legal interest that accrued at 12% per annum from August 13, 2008 to June 30, 2013, and thereafter accrued and continues to accrue at 6% per annum
. The potential payment amount as expressed in U.S. dollars varies with the Philippine peso to U.S. dollar exchange rate. In December 2017, a group of 97 of the former employees of the Philippine subsidiary indicated that they proposed to record the judgment as to themselves in New Jersey. In January 2018, in response to an action initiated by Innodata Inc., the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (“USDC”) entered a preliminary injunction that enjoins these former employees from pursuing or seeking recognition or enforcement of the judgment against Innodata Inc. in the U.S. during the pendency of the action and until further order of the USDC. In June 2018, the USDC entered a consent order administratively closing the action subject to return of the action to the active docket upon the written request of Innodata Inc. or the former employees, with the USDC retaining jurisdiction over the matter and the preliminary injunction remaining in full force and effect. The principal relevant cases in the Philippines are Court of Appeals Case Nos. CA - G.R. SP No. 93295 Innodata Employees Association (IDEA), Eleanor Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al., and CA - G.R. SP No. 90538 Innodata Philippines, Inc. vs. Honorable Acting Secretary Manuel G. Imson, et al. (28 June 2007), the Department of Labor and Employment National Labor Relations Commission, Republic of the Philippines (NLRC - NCR - Case No.07 - 04713 - 2002, et al., Innodata Employees Association (IDEA) and Eleanor A. Tolentino, et al. vs. Innodata Philippines, Inc., et al), and the Department of Labor and Employment Office of the Secretary of Labor and Employment, Republic of the Philippines (Case No. OS - AJ - 0015 - 2001, In Re: Labor Dispute at Innodata Philippines, Inc.). The U.S. District Court action is Civil Action No.: 2:17 - cv - 13268 - SDW - LDW Innodata Inc. v. Myrna C. Augustin - Simon; et al.
In February 2024, David D’Agostino filed a putative class action captioned D’Agostino v. Innodata Inc., et al., in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company and certain of its current and former officers (the “Securities Class Action”). In October 2024, the presiding judge in the Securities Class Action appointed a lead plaintiff and approved the lead plaintiff’s choice of counsel. In January 2025, an amended Securities Class Action complaint was filed in the Securities Class Action. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and it alleges, among other things, that the defendants made false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s artificial intelligence (“AI”) technology and services. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, fees, interest, and costs. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously, but the Company cannot predict the outcome of the action at this time and can give no assurance that the asserted claims will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.
Subsequently, in March 2024, the Company received a letter from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Enforcement (the “SEC”), requesting the Company preserve certain documents and data; in August 2024 the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) requesting the Company to produce certain documents; and in September 2024 the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting certain information. The Company believes that the SEC and DOJ requests are related to the conduct alleged in the Securities Class Action, and is cooperating with these investigations. The Company is unable to predict when these matters will be resolved or what further action, if any, the SEC or DOJ may take in connection with it.
The Company is also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. While the Company believes that it has adequate reserves for those losses that it believes are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the ultimate results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty.

While management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or overall trends in consolidated results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Substantial recovery against the Company in the above-referenced Philippine action could have a material adverse impact on the Company, and unfavorable rulings or recoveries in the other proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operating results in the period in which the ruling or recovery occurs. In addition, the Company’s estimate of the potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or overall consolidated results of operations for the above referenced legal proceedings could change in the future.
The Company’s legal accruals related to legal proceedings and claims are based on the Company’s determination of whether or not a loss is probable. The Company reviews outstanding proceedings and claims with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. The accruals are adjusted if necessary. While the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that it estimates could reach approximately $
450,000
 in the aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. If circumstances change, the Company may be required to record adjustments that could be material to its reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Foreign Currency 
- To the extent that the currencies of the Company’s production facilities located in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel fluctuate, the Company is subject to risks of changing costs of production after pricing is established for certain customer projects. In addition, the Company is exposed to the risk of foreign currency fluctuation on the non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues, and on the monetary assets and liabilities held by its foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in local currency.
Indemnifications 
- The Company is obligated under certain circumstances to indemnify directors, officers and certain employees against costs and liabilities incurred in actions or threatened actions brought against such individuals because such individuals acted in the capacity of director, officer or fiduciary of the Company. In addition, the Company has contracts with certain customers pursuant to which the Company has agreed to indemnify the customer for certain specified and limited claims under such contract. These indemnification obligations occur in the ordinary course of business and, in many cases, do not include a limit on potential maximum future payments. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not recorded a liability for any obligations arising as a result of these indemnification obligations.
​
8.           Operating Leases
The Company has various lease agreements for its offices and service delivery centers. The Company has determined that the risks and benefits related to the leased properties are retained by the lessors. Accordingly, these are accounted for as operating leases.
These lease agreements are for terms ranging from 
three
 to 
eleven years
 and, in most cases, provide for rental escalations ranging from 
1.75
% to 
15
%. Most of these agreements are renewable at the mutual consent of the parties to the contract.
The Company recognizes an operating lease liability and right-of-use asset in compliance with current lease accounting standard ASC 842. The amount of right-of-use asset is equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using the incremental borrowing rate of each respective country. Modifications, if any are recalculated and corresponding adjustments are made to the carrying values of both the lease liability and right-of-use assets.
A right-of-use asset is measured as the amount of the lease liability adjusted for the amount of deferred straight-line rent, prepaid rent and lease incentive allowances previously recognized.

Most of the non-U.S. subsidiaries provide for government-mandated defined pension benefits. For certain of these subsidiaries, vested eligible employees are provided a lump sum payment upon retiring from the Company at a defined age. The lump sum amount is based on the salary and tenure as of retirement date. Other non-U.S. subsidiaries provide for a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, based upon the salary and tenure as of the date employment ceases. The liability for such defined benefit obligations is determined and provided on the basis of actuarial valuations. As of December 31, 2024, these plans were unfunded. Pension expense for our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $
1.2
 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The following tables set out the status of the non-U.S. pension benefits and the amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the components of pension costs for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands):

11.        Stock Options
The Innodata Inc. 2013 Stock Plan (as amended, the “2013 Plan”) expired in accordance with its terms on June 3, 2023. Pursuant to the terms of the 2013 Plan, no further awards may be granted under the 2013 Plan following its expiration. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
3,365,193
 shares of our common stock underlying outstanding options or rights under the 2013 Plan. Outstanding awards made under the 2013 Plan prior to the 2013 Plan’s expiration will remain in effect until such awards have been satisfied or terminated in accordance with the terms of the 2013 Plan and such awards.
On June 9, 2023, stockholders of the Company approved amendments to the Innodata Inc. 2021 Equity Compensation Plan (as amended, the “2021 Plan”). The number of shares of common stock of Innodata Inc. that may be delivered, purchased or used for reference purposes (with respect to stock appreciation rights or stock units) for awards granted under the 2021 Plan is 
4,000,000
 (the “Share Reserve”). Shares subject to an option or stock appreciation right granted under the 2021 Plan count against the Share Reserve as 
one
 share for every share granted, and shares subject to any other type of award granted under the 
2021
 Plan count against the Share Reserve as 
two
 shares for every share granted for awards granted prior to April 11, 2023, and 
one
 and a half shares for every share granted for awards granted on or after April 11, 2023. Any shares withheld, tendered or exchanged by a participant in the 2021 Plan as full or partial payment to Innodata of the exercise price under an option under the 2021 Plan, or in satisfaction of a participant’s tax withholding obligations with respect to any award under the 2021 Plan, will not be added back to the Share Reserve.
The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average fair value of the options granted, and weighted-average assumptions were as follows:

The Company estimates the risk-free interest rate using the U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected term of the options in effect at the time of grant. The expected term of options granted is based on a combination of vesting schedules, term of the options and historical experience. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The Company uses an expected dividend yield of 
zero
 since it has never declared or paid any dividends on its capital stock.

On December 31, 2024, the Company redeemed the 
6.1
%
 non-controlling interest in Innodata DocGenix, LLC; Innodata DocGenix, LLC, is now a wholly owned subsidiary. The Company accounted for the transaction in accordance with ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation”, which discusses the proper accounting treatment of the carrying value for the non-controlling interest. Under the standard, any change in ownership that does not result in a loss of control is to be accounted for as an equity transaction. To comply with the standard, the Company reclassified the remaining carrying value of the Non-controlling interest attributed to the DocGenix subsidiary amounting to 
$
0.6
 million from Non-controlling interest to Additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024. 
13.         Comprehensive loss
Accumulated other comprehensive loss, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, consists of pension liability adjustments, net of taxes, foreign currency translation adjustment and changes in fair value of derivatives, net of taxes.

​
Basic income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income per share is computed by considering the impact of the potential issuance of common shares, using the treasury stock method, on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. For those securities that are not convertible into a class of common stock, the two-class method of computing loss per share is used.
Options to purchase 
4.0
 million shares of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2024 were outstanding. Of these options, 
3.7
 million were included in the computation of diluted income per share while the remaining 
0.3
 million were not included in the computation of diluted income per share because the exercise price of the options were greater than the average market price of the common shares and therefore have not been considered as potential equity shares. Also included in the computation of dilutive income per share are 
513,455
 restricted stock units using the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2024.
​
Options to purchase 
6.3
 million shares of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2023 were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

16.        Derivatives
The Company conducts a large portion of its operations in international markets which subject it to foreign currency fluctuations. The most significant foreign currency exposures occur when revenue and associated accounts receivable are collected in one currency and expenses to generate revenues are incurred in another currency. The Company is also subject to wage inflation and other government mandated increases and operating expenses in Asian countries where the Company has the majority of its operations. The Company’s primary inflation and exchange rate exposure relates to payroll, other payroll costs and operating expenses in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka and Israel.
In addition, although most of the Company’s revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of total revenues is denominated in Canadian dollars, Pound Sterling and Euros.
The Company’s policy is to enter derivative instrument contracts with terms that coincide with the underlying exposure being hedged for a period up to 12 months. As such, the Company’s derivative instruments are expected to be highly effective. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the entire change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded to Other comprehensive income (loss). Upon settlement of these contracts, the change in the fair value recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings and included as part of Direct operating costs. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, any change in fair value is recorded directly in earnings as part of Direct operating costs.
The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All derivatives are recognized at their fair value and classified based on the instrument’s maturity date. The total notional amount for outstanding derivatives designated as hedges was $
22.5
 million and $
10.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

17.          Line of Credit
​
On April 4, 2023, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as lender, and Innodata Inc., Innodata Synodex, LLC, Innodata docGenix, LLC and Agility PR Solutions LLC as co-borrowers. On July 21, 2023, Innodata Services, LLC signed a Joinder Agreement to join the Credit Agreement as a co-borrower. On August 5, 2024, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement (together with the Credit Agreement, the “Amended Credit Agreement”). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a secured revolving line of credit (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) up to an amount equal to the lesser of the borrowing base and $
30.0
 million (the “Maximum Credit”) and provides that a Borrower may request an increase to the Revolving Credit Facility’s Maximum Credit of up to, but not to exceed $
50.0
 million, subject to the approval of the Lender. The Revolving Credit Facility’s borrowing base is calculated on the basis of (i) 
85
% of eligible accounts (other than eligible foreign accounts and unbilled accounts), plus (ii) the lesser of (a) 
80
% of eligible accounts that are unbilled accounts and (b) 
30
% of all eligible accounts, plus (iii) the lesser of (a) 
85
% of eligible foreign accounts, (b) 
20
% of all eligible accounts and (c) $
4.0
 million, minus (iv) certain other reserves and adjustments. As of December 31, 2024, such borrowing base calculation equaled approximately $
22.3
 million. The Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires the Borrowers, on a consolidated basis, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 
1.10
 to 1.00. Except as set forth in the Credit Agreement, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to the daily simple secured overnight financing rate (“
SOFR
”) plus 
2.25
%. The Company did not utilize the Revolving Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2024 or during the subsequent period through the filing date of this Report.
