Item 2. Properties.
We maintain leased property in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, which is our headquarters, and in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Israel and Germany. The square footage of all our leased properties totals approximately 192,000. Our leased properties in the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Germany and Israel are primarily used by our DDS segment; and our leased property in India is primarily used by our DDS and Synodex segments. Our leased property in the United States is our corporate headquarters and is used by all segments.
In addition, we may need to lease additional property in the future. We believe that we will be able to obtain suitable additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms on an “as needed” basis.
