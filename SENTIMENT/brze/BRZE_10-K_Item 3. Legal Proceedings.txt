Item 3. Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not presently a party to any litigation the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Defending such proceedings can be costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures

Overview
Braze is a leading customer engagement platform that empowers brands to Be Absolutely Engaging. Our platform empowers brands to listen to their customers better, understand them more deeply, and act on that understanding in a way that is human and personal. Using our platform, brands ingest and process customer data in real time, orchestrate and optimize contextually relevant, marketing campaigns across multiple channels. Our platform is designed so that interactions between brands and consumers have the same relevance and cross-channel continuity as human interactions. 
Our customers include many established global enterprises and leading technology innovators, and span a wide variety of sizes and industries, including retail and consumer goods, media and entertainment, telecommunications, restaurants and on-demand services, healthcare and life sciences, technology, manufacturing, education, government and public services, and financial services.
We primarily generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to customers for the use of our platform. Our subscription fees are principally based on an upfront commitment by our customers for messaging volumes, a specific number of monthly active users, platform access and/or support and certain add-on products. Additionally, we provide professional services, which better enable customers to successfully onboard and use our platform, including certain premium professional services such as email deliverability support and dedicated technical support staff.
We employ a land-and-expand business model centered around offering products that are easy to adopt and have a rapid time to value. We expand our reach within existing customers when our customers add new channels, purchase additional subscription products, implement new engagement strategies, or onboard new business units and geographies. We also grow as our customers grow because our pricing is based in large part on the number of consumers that our customers reach and the volume of messages our customers send. Accordingly, as our customers increase the use of our platform and increase the number of end users reached via our platform, the value of our contracts with such customers also increases.
We have grown significantly in recent periods. We generated revenue of $593.4 million, $471.8 million, and $355.4 million in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 25.8% from the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024 to January 31, 2025 and 32.7%
 from the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 to 
January 31, 2024. We had net losses of $104.0 million, $130.4 million and $140.7 million, in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $36.7 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $6.9 million and net cash used in operating activities of $22.3 million in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Non-GAAP free cash flow was $19.6 million, $(6.5) million and $(39.0) million in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. See the section titled “— Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow” for additional information about how we calculate free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial metric, and a reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP.
Factors Affecting Our Performance
Acquiring New Customers
We believe there is substantial opportunity to continue to grow our customer base. We intend to continue to expand our customer base in verticals where we already have a strong presence, such as retail and consumer goods, media and entertainment, telecommunications, restaurants and on-demand services, healthcare and life sciences, technology, manufacturing, education, government and public services, and financial services — and to increase our presence in verticals where we are not yet strongly represented. Through our sales and marketing efforts, we also plan to capitalize on industries subject to ongoing digital transformation and where direct-to-consumer relationships are accelerating, to further propel adoption of our technology. As of January 31, 2025, we had 2,296 customers across a broad range of sizes and industries. Our ability to attract new customers will depend on a number of factors, including the quality and pricing of our products, offerings of our competitors and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
We define a customer as the separate and distinct, ultimate parent-level entity that has an active subscription with us to use our products. A single organization could have multiple distinct contracting divisions or subsidiaries, all of which together would be considered a single customer.
Expanding Within Our Existing Customer Base
49
Table 
of Contents
We believe we can achieve significant growth by expanding sales within our existing customer base. We expand the use of our platform by existing customers by, among others, adding new channels and increasing the messaging volume we sell to our customers as their businesses and needs continue to grow and as they connect directly with additional consumers, which in turn leads to a need for greater messaging capacity. We intend to continue to invest in developing and enhancing our products and functionality. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including our customers’ satisfaction with our solutions, the ability of our customers to attract new end users, competition, pricing and overall changes in our customers’ spending levels.
Historically, we have experienced significant expansion within a customer’s business once our platform is deployed, with customers typically increasing the number of monthly active users, channels and use cases, as well as purchasing additional products. A monthly active user is an end user of a customer who has engaged with the customer’s applications and websites in the previous thirty-day period. We include each distinguishable end user in our calculation of monthly active users, even though some users may access our customers’ applications and websites using more than one device, and multiple users may gain access using the same device. As of January 31, 2025, we had approximately 7.2 billion monthly active users, up from approximately 6.2 billion monthly active users as of January 31, 2024.
Braze supports interactions across a broad range of both in-product and out-of-product messaging channels. The flexibility of our platform also allows us to add new channels quickly and efficiently as they become relevant to our customers. The breadth of channels we offer, and our ability to efficiently expand our offering of channels, allows us to expand our reach within existing customers as they purchase additional channels from us.
In addition to monthly active users, we have a history of increasing annual recurring revenue, or ARR, from our customers. We define ARR as the annualized value of customer subscription contracts, including certain premium professional services that are subject to contractual subscription terms, as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the next 12 months is renewed on its existing terms (including contracts for which we are negotiating a renewal). Our calculation of ARR is not adjusted for the impact of any known or projected future events (such as customer cancellations, expansion or contraction of existing customers relationships or price increases or decreases) that may cause any such contract not to be renewed on its existing terms. Our ARR may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our products and professional services, pricing, competitive offerings, economic conditions or overall changes in our customers’ spending levels. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and does not represent our GAAP revenue on an annualized basis or a forecast of revenue, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. 
For clarity, we use annualized invoiced amounts per customer subscription contract, including certain premium professional services that are subject to contractual subscription terms, as compared to revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP, to calculate our ARR. Our invoiced amounts are not matched to the performance obligations associated with the underlying subscription contract and premium professional service obligations as they are with respect to our GAAP revenue. This can result in timing differences between our GAAP revenue and ARR calculations. For our revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP, we recognize revenue related to contracts with customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for subscription and professional services. See the section titled “— Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for additional information regarding how we recognize revenue on a GAAP basis. Investors should not place undue reliance on ARR as an indicator of our future or expected results. Moreover, ARR may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies and may not be comparable to such other metrics.
A further indication of the propensity of our customer relationships to expand over time is our dollar-based net retention rate. We calculate our dollar-based net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from the cohort of all customers as of 12 months prior to such period-end, or the Prior Period ARR. We then calculate the ARR from these same customers as of the current period-end, or the Current Period ARR. Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the point-in-time dollar-based net retention rate. We then calculate the weighted average point-in-time dollar-based net retention rates as of the last day of each month in the current trailing 12-month period to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate. Our dollar-based net retention rate for the trailing 12 months ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, was 111%, 117%, and 124% respectively, for all our customers, and 114%, 120%, and 126%, respectively, for our customers with ARR of $500,000 or more. In addition, 247, 202, and 156 of our customers had ARR of $500,000 or more as of January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
Our dollar-based net retention rate is influenced by macroeconomic factors that impact our customers’ purchasing decisions, which may impact the revenue attributable to such customers. The decline in our trailing 12-month dollar-based net retention rate was primarily due to customer turnover and renewals at lower subscription levels. In particular, we have observed that customer renewals in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and high interest rate climate have led customers to renew their contracts at levels more closely aligned with their current needs, rather than opting for larger commitments based on anticipated future demand.

Expanding Geographically
We believe there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand our presence in international markets we have already penetrated and by entering markets we have not yet penetrated. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, approximately 45%, 43%, and 42%, of our revenue was generated outside of the United States, respectively. We expect to increase market penetration in regions including Europe and Asia-Pacific and to further capitalize on the greenfield opportunity in regions such as Latin America. Although these investments in geographic regions may negatively affect our operating results in the near term, we believe that they will contribute to our long-term growth.
Sustaining Innovation and Technology Leadership
Our success is dependent on our ability to sustain innovation and technology leadership in order to maintain our competitive advantage. We are focused on investing in research and development to continue to enhance our platform. For example, we continue to develop our artificial intelligence capabilities, to enable brands to better analyze and act on customer data, and to expand our channel offerings. We believe our market-driven product development approach maximizes the return on new feature development and channel expansion. Our customers consistently volunteer to participate in the testing of new products, which indicates their appetite for new and innovative functionality. We believe our continued innovation will provide new avenues for growth through which we will continue to deliver differentiated outcomes for our customers. We intend to continue to invest in building additional products that expand our capabilities and facilitate the extension of our platform to new channels and use cases.
Macroeconomic Conditions on Our Business
Unfavorable conditions in the economy, both in the United States and abroad, may negatively affect the growth of our business and our results of operations. General macroeconomic and socioeconomic conditions such as, among others, instability in the banking and financial services sector, international and domestic supply chain risks, inflationary pressure, interest rate increases, declines in consumer confidence, international conflicts and domestic and foreign political unrest have led to increased economic uncertainty. We cannot predict if these trends will continue, and, accordingly, we are not able to estimate the ongoing effects on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity as a result of these macroeconomic factors. For additional details, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
Revenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) subscription services and (2) professional services and other.
Subscription services primarily consist of access to our customer engagement platform and related customer support. Our customers enter into a subscription for committed contractual entitlements. To the extent that our customers’ usage exceeds the committed contractual entitlements under their subscription plans, they are charged for excess usage, or they may exercise an option to purchase an incremental volume tier of committed contractual entitlements. Revenue associated with platform subscriptions is recognized ratably over the contract term, which is consistent with the period over which services are provided to the customer. Fees associated with excess usage and incremental volume are also treated as subscription revenue. To date, fees associated with excess usage have not been material.
Professional services and other revenue consists of fees for distinct services rendered in training and assisting our customers to configure our platform for their use at the onset of their initial contract or when a new product is purchased. Such revenue is generally recognized over a period of up to six months from providing access to the platform. We also provide additional platform and feature enhancement and optimization services which are generally recognized ratably over the contract term.
Deferred revenue consists of customer billings in advance of revenue being recognized. We generally invoice our customers for subscription services arrangements annually in advance and for professional services upfront.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists of direct costs related to providing platform access to our customers and to performing onboarding and professional services including consulting services. These costs primarily include payments to third-party cloud infrastructure providers for hosting software solutions, costs associated with application service providers utilized to deliver the platform, personnel-related costs, including salaries, cash-based performance compensation, benefits and stock-based 
51
Table 
of Contents
compensation, and overhead cost allocations, including rent, utilities, depreciation, information technology costs, amortization of internal use software and certain administrative personnel costs.
We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our platform infrastructure and our customer support and success organizations to expand the capabilities of our platform. The level, timing and relative investment in our infrastructure could affect our cost of revenue in the future. We expect our cost of revenue to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to grow our business.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit represents revenue less cost of revenue. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as our revenue and cost of revenue fluctuates, including as a result of the timing and amount of resources we dedicate to improving our platform and expanding our products.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs, including salaries, cash-based performance compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation, are the most significant component of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs, which include rent, utilities, depreciation, information technology costs and certain administrative personnel costs. As we continue to expand our operations, we expect an increase in personnel headcount and expansion of our global footprint.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales and marketing organization, sales commissions, costs related to brand awareness, sponsorships, customer marketing events and advertising, agency costs, travel-related expenses and allocated overhead costs.
We intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to help drive the growth of our business. We expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in sales and marketing activities to acquire new customers and increase sales to existing customers.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our engineering, service, design and information technology teams. Additionally, research and development expenses include allocated overhead costs and contractor fees. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized internal-use software development costs are excluded from research and development expenses as they are capitalized as a component of property and equipment, net and amortized to cost of revenue over the software’s expected useful life, which is generally three years.
We expect to continue our investment in research and development to enhance the user experience of our current customers and attract new customers. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in enhancing our platform.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance, legal, human resources and other administrative functions, as well as non-personnel costs such as legal, accounting and other professional service fees, software costs, certain tax, license and insurance-related expenses and allocated overhead costs. Additionally, from time to time general and administrative expenses may include expenses associated with our donation of shares of Class A common stock to a charitable donor-advised fund in connection with our Pledge 1% commitment.
We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future but decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term, as we focus on processes, systems, and controls to enable our internal support functions to scale with the growth of our business. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, expenses related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and higher expenses for insurance, investor relations and professional services.
Other Income, Net
52
Table 
of Contents
Other income, net, primarily consists of net exchange gains or losses on foreign currency transactions and investment income consists primarily of income earned on our investments, cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes consists of state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance in jurisdictions where we had net deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.

The increase in revenue of $121.6 million, or 25.8%, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was primarily driven by an $119.2 million, or 26.4%, increase in subscription revenue. Approximately 73.8% of the increase in subscription revenue was attributable to the growth from existing customers increase in monthly active users, expansion across channels and committed entitlements and features, and the remaining 26.2% was attributable to new customers. Total customers grew to 2,296 as of January 31, 2025 from 2,044 as of January 31, 2024. Professional services revenue increased $2.4 million, or 11.6%, due to an increase in deliverability services, technical account management, and support engagement services. These increases were partially offset by the decline in onboarding revenue as a result of the continued engagement of new customers with third-party partner-led onboarding. Additionally, in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, our international revenue increased by $62.4 million as we continued to expand market penetration in regions such as Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

he increase in co
st of revenue of $35.7 million, or 24.2%, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase of $7.5 million in hosting, infrastructure, and other third-party fees associated with delivering our platform and a $24.0 million increase in third-party messaging fees associated with growth in premium messaging channels. In addition, we had an increase in personnel and overhead costs of $3.2 million. The increased infrastructure, messaging, and personnel costs were incurred to support overall revenue growth.
Our gross profit increased $85.9 million, or 26.5%, in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, and our gross margin increased by 0.4% to 69.1% in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 from 68.7% in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. These increases were due primarily to improved personnel efficiencies,

economies of scale, and the optimization of costs of our tech stack as our infrastructure costs to support our revenue growth did not increase at the same pace as our revenue.

The increase in general and administrative expenses of $14.1 million, or 13.8%, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in personnel and overhead costs of $13.2 million, which included $5.6 million of stock-based compensation costs and $2.3 million of depreciation expense, primarily related to the winding down of our old office as we moved to our new headquarters in the fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to investments in our finance and administrative functions to continue to scale our processes, systems, and controls, to enable our ongoing compliance with public company legal and regulatory requirements. The increases in expenses were partially offset by a decrease in professional services costs of $0.5 million related to the acquisition of North Star in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.

The investment income increase was driven primarily by the graded maturation of the portfolio positions at higher interest rates and the reinvestment of proceeds in a high interest rate environment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Funds
As of January 31, 2025, our principal source of liquidity was cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $514.0 million. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of deposit accounts, interest-bearing money market accounts, U.S. government, and corporate securities that are stated at fair value. Our marketable securities positions consists mostly of highly liquid short-term investments. The investment income that we generate on these investments is not material to our overall cash balance, but may be adversely affected due to volatility in interest rates. 
Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through the net proceeds received from the sales of equity securities and cash generated from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. We have generated losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $586.8 million as of January 31, 2025. We had cash flows provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 of $36.7 million.
A substantial source of our cash provided by operating activities is our deferred revenue, which is included on our consolidated balance sheets as a liability. Deferred revenue consists of the unearned portion of billed fees for our subscriptions, which is recorded as revenue over the term of the subscription agreement. As of January 31, 2025, we had total deferred revenue of $240.3 million, of which $240.0 million was recorded as a current liability. Deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue when all of the revenue recognition criteria are met.

Operating Activities
For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was $36.7 million, primarily due to a net loss of $104.0 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $163.4 million and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $22.7 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily relate to stock-based compensation of $115.1 million, amortization of deferred contract costs of $35.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $10.1 million, and expense associated with the donation of our Class A common stock to a charitable donor-advised fund of $3.8 million. The cash inflows from changes in our operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of $35.9 million as a result of increased billings driven by timing of subscriptions and renewals. The cash inflows were offset by cash outflows primarily from an increase in accounts receivable of $5.4 million and an increase in deferred contract costs of $48.2 million as a result of commissions on new bookings and renewals.
For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.9 million, primarily due to a net loss of $130.4 million adjusted for non-cash charges of $136.2 million and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $1.1 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily relate to stock-based compensation of $97.2 million, amortization of deferred contract costs of $29.8 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $7.0 million, and expense associated with the donation of our Class A common stock to a charitable donor-advised fund of $3.8 million. The cash inflows from changes in our operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of $34.1 million as a result of increased billings driven by timing of subscriptions and renewals. The cash inflows were offset by cash outflows primarily from an increase in deferred contract costs of $45.1 million as a result of commissions on new bookings and renewals.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $36.5 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, primarily consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $218.0 million,, purchases of property and equipment of $13.2 million, and capitalization of internal-use software costs of $3.8 million, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of $195.4 million.

Net cash used in investing activities was $20.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, primarily consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $248.1 million, cash paid for the acquisition of North Star of $16.3 million, purchases of property and equipment of $9.8 million, and capitalization of internal-use software costs of $3.6 million, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of 257.7 million.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $11.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, primarily consisting of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $6.9 million and proceeds from stock purchases associated with our employee stock purchase plan of $7.7 million, offset by payments of deferred purchase considerations related to the acquisition of North Star of $2.9 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $13.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, primarily consisting of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options of $7.3 million and proceeds from stock purchases associated with our employee stock purchase plan of $6.0 million, offset by payments of deferred purchase considerations related to the acquisition of North Star of $0.2 million.
Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow
We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. To supplement our consolidated financial statements, we provide investors with the amount of free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Our management uses free cash flow to assess our operating performance and our progress towards our goal of positive free cash flow. We define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and amounts capitalized for internal-use software development costs. We believe that free cash flow is a useful indicator of liquidity as it measures our ability to generate cash, or our need to access additional sources of cash, to fund operations and investments.
Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (1) it is not a substitute for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, (2) other companies may calculate free cash flow or similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison, and (3) the utility of free cash flow is further limited as it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for any given period.
The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, for the periods presented:

Our free cash flow increased for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 from the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, primarily due to higher collections as a result of an increase in billings that are aligned with new contracts and contract renewals. We expect our free cash flow to fluctuate in future periods with changes in our operating expenses and as we continue to invest in our growth. Additionally, our free cash flow may be influenced by macroeconomic factors that impact our collection efforts for customer payments. If we experience collection pressure it may lengthen the time to collect on accounts receivable and increase our bad debt expense, either of which could negatively impact our free cash flow.
Liquidity Outlook
We assess our liquidity primarily through our cash on hand as well as the projected timing of billings under contracts with our paying customers and related collection cycles. While our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including revenue growth and costs incurred to support customer usage and growth in our customer base, increased research 
57
Table 
of Contents
and development expenses to support the growth of our business and related infrastructure, and increased general and administrative expenses to support being a publicly-traded company, we believe our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.
Our most significant funding
 requirements are principally comprised of employee compensation and related taxes and benefits, non-cancelable purchase commitments, and operating lease obligations. Non-cancelable purchase commitments for business operations and operating lease obligations total $224.4 million and $114.8 million, respectively, as of January 31, 2025. Purchase commitments for business operations are predominately related to cloud hosting, infrastructure, and other software-based services and due primarily over the next three years. Our future funding requirements to settle our obligations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
While we anticipate being able to satisfy our commitments through a combination of our available current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and cash generated from the sale of subscriptions to our platform, if our estimates prove to be inaccurate we may seek to sell additional equity or other securities that may result in dilution to our stockholders, issue debt or seek other third-party funding, in order to satisfy our future funding requirements.
Seasonality
We have experienced seasonality in our cost of revenue as a result of our customers’ increased usage of our platform based on their business demands. We typically experience the highest sequential increase in overall messaging volume and compute and storage requirements during the fourth quarter due to the increased activity related to the holiday season and general customer engagement efforts around the end of the calendar year.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.
We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgement or complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 
Revenue Recognition
We generate revenue from fees related to subscription services and professional services and other. We recognize revenue related to contracts with customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services. This is determined by following a five-step process, which includes (1) identifying the contract with a customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price and (5) recognizing revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation.
We identify performance obligations in a contract based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are identifiable from other promises in the contract, or that are distinct. If not considered distinct, the promised goods or services are combined with other goods or services and accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining the distinct performance obligations in a contract requires judgment. Our performance obligations primarily include access to our platform, which includes subscription contracts, technical support and platform updates and professional services, which include onboarding services.
We allocate the transaction price of the contract to each distinct performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Estimating standalone selling prices for our performance obligations requires judgment and is based on multiple factors, including, but not limited to, observable cost data, industry margin studies, historical selling prices, internal cost structure, internal pricing policies, and pricing practices in different regions and sales channels. We review the estimated standalone selling price for our performance obligations periodically and update, if needed, to ensure that the methodology utilized reflects our current pricing practices. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized as revenue when or as the products or services are transferred to the customer.
Cost to Obtain a Contract with a Customer
58
Table 
of Contents
We capitalize incremental costs of obtaining revenue contracts, which primarily consist of internal sales commissions and agent commissions. We amortize these commissions on a systematic basis, consistent with the pattern of transfer of the expected benefit period or services to which the contract relates, generally up to four years. Four years represents the estimated benefit period of the customer relationship taking into account factors such as peer estimates of technology lives and customer lives as well as our own historical data. Commissions paid for contract renewals are amortized over the renewal period.
Contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over up to four years, which reflects the expected period of benefit of the performance obligation, and may be longer than the initial contract period. We determine the estimated benefit period by considering both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the length of the subscription terms in our customer contracts and the anticipated life of our technology, among other factors.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would reduce the provision for income taxes. Conversely, in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, we would charge an adjustment to the valuation allowance to earnings in the period when such determination is made. As of January 31, 2025, we recorded a full valuation allowance in jurisdictions where we had net deferred tax assets, which consist of net operating loss carryforwards and other basis differences, as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized.

 accounting pronouncements.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates.
Inflation Risk
We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations, other than its impact on the general economy. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to inflationary pressures, we might not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Interest Rate Risk and Market Risk
We had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $514.0 million as of January 31, 2025, of which $430.5 million was invested in U.S. government securities, foreign securities, and corporate debt securities. Our cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our investments in marketable securities are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.
Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. As of January 31, 2025, a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Because we classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in fair value are determined to be non-temporary.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
59
Table 
of Contents
Our reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is primarily the respective local currency. Substantially all of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our only sales denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollars are our sales in Japan, which are denominated in Yen. Therefore, our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, which are primarily the United States, United Kingdom, Singapore and Japan. The consolidated results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The assets and liabilities of each of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Gains or losses due to transactions in foreign currencies are included in interest and other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in foreign exchange gains and losses related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In the event our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities, revenue, or expenses increase, our results of operations may be more greatly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies in which we do business. To date we have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency transactions, although we may choose to do so in the future. A hypothetical 10% change in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies during any of the periods presented would not have had a material effect on our realized and unrealized gains (losses) on foreign exchange transactions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Braze, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Braze, Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, redeemable non-controlling interest and stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 31, 2025 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition
Description of the Matter
During the year ended January 31, 2025, the Company recognized revenue of $593.4 million and recorded deferred revenue of $240.3 million as of January 31, 2025. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives revenue primarily from subscriptions to their platform, including associated support, and professional services. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. 
Auditing management’s recognition of revenue was challenging due to the nature and extent of effort required as a result of the high volume of revenue contracts and the use of multiple applications and data sources in the revenue recognition process. In addition, as described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management identified a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting associated with the information technology general controls of various information systems, including those that affect the revenue recognition process, which required changes to the extent of our audit procedures.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used within the Company’s revenue recognition process. For a sample of customer contracts, we compared the contractual terms to reports derived from the Company’s systems, recalculated the amount of revenue recognized and related deferred revenue, and reviewed evidence of the related cash receipts. In response to the material weakness discussed above, we increased the extent of revenue contract samples tested. We also performed analytical procedures to quantify the expected deferred revenue amount based on the monthly invoicing activities and compared it to the amounts recorded by the Company. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Braze, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Braze, Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified a material weakness in controls related to the operation of information technology (IT) general controls for IT applications supporting the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, redeemable non-controlling interest and stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, and the related notes. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2025 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 31, 2025, which expressed an unqualified opinion, thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

BRAZE, INC.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. 
Company Overview
Description of Business
Braze, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or “Braze”), is a cloud-based customer engagement platform that delivers customer-centric experiences across push notifications, email, in-product messaging, SMS, MMS and RCS messages, and more. Customers use the Braze platform to facilitate real-time experiences between brands and customers in a more authentic and human way.
We began operations in 2011 and are incorporated in the state of Delaware. Our headquarters are located in New York, New York. As of January 31, 2025, we also lease additional office space in over 10 cities across North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East.
2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities (“VIE”) for which we are the primary beneficiary. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications and immaterial changes have been made to prior-period financial statements to conform to the current-period presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported period. We evaluate estimates based on historical and anticipated results, trends, and various other assumptions. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the standalone selling price for separate performance obligations in our revenue arrangements, expected period of benefit for deferred contract costs, the valuation of common stock and stock-based compensation, the allocation of overhead costs between cost of revenue and operating expenses, the estimated useful lives of intangible and depreciable assets, the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities from business combinations, valuation of long-lived assets and their recoverability, including goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax estimates including our ability to utilize net operating losses.
Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and makes adjustments as facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects, including the uncertainty surrounding rapidly changing market and economic conditions from global or domestic macroeconomic and socioeconomic conditions such as, among others, instability in the banking and financial services sector, international and domestic supply chain risks, inflationary pressure, interest rate increases, declines in consumer confidence, international conflicts and domestic and foreign political unrest, that impact us and our customers, cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from those estimates and many of our estimates and assumptions have required increased judgement and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss attributable to Braze, Inc. Common Stockholders per Share 
Basic net loss attributable to Braze, Inc. per common stockholder’s share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of Braze, Inc. common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to Braze, Inc. by the weighted-average number of shares of Braze, Inc. common stock together with the number of additional shares of Braze Inc. common stock that would have been outstanding if all potentially dilutive shares of Braze Inc. common stock had been issued. Since we were in a net loss position for the periods presented, basic net loss per share attributable to Braze, Inc. common stockholders is the same as diluted net loss per share attributable to Braze, Inc. common stockholders since the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive.
71
Table 
of Contents
Segment Reporting
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is the CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, we have 
one
 operating segment, which is the business of cloud-based customer engagement platform subscriptions.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value.
Level 1 – 
Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
Level 2 – 
Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.
Level 3 – 
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data for the related assets or liabilities.
The categorization of a financial instrument within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our financial instruments include cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current assets and liabilities. At January 31, 2025 and 2024, the carrying amounts of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current assets and liabilities approximated fair values because of their short-term nature.
Foreign Currency
The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is primarily the local currency. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured at period-end using the period-end exchange rate. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in other income (expense), net, on the consolidated statements of operations. All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the period, retained earnings and other equity items are translated at historical rates, and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the period. The gain or loss resulting from the process of translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars is reflected as foreign currency cumulative translation adjustments reported on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. 
Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations when realized.

Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and highly liquid investments with original contractual maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents consist of deposit accounts and interest-bearing money market accounts that are stated at fair value.
As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, approximately $
0.5
 million and $
3.9
 million, respectively, of deposits were restricted due to multiple letters of credit related to our leased and subleased properties. These deposits were classified as current and noncurrent based on the related underlying lease term.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of January 31, 2025 and 2024 (in thousands):

Accounts Receivable, Net and Credit Losses
Accounts receivable, net consists of customer obligations due under normal trade terms and are recorded at amounts billed and unbilled to customers, net of allowance for any potential uncollectible accounts. Unbilled amounts are included in trade accounts receivable, net, which generally arise from our contractual right to bill our customers in advance of services on the contract effective date. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts and do not bear interest. 
We maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, net which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable, net and changes in this allowance are recorded as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We assess collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis when similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectability based on past due status and make judgements about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. A receivable is considered past due if we have not received payment based on agreed-upon terms. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. No material write-offs of accounts receivable have been recognized in any of the periods presented.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Restricted cash consists of letters of credit related to our leased properties. For cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions to the extent of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limits. Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities balances are maintained at financial institutions that management believes are of high-credit, quality financial institutions, where deposits, at times, exceed the FDIC limits.
Significant customers are those which represent 10% or more of our total revenue for the period, or accounts receivable at the balance sheets dates. For fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and 2024, no customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. 
For accounts receivable, we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by customers to the extent of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. As of January 31, 2025, one customer accounted for approximately 
12
% of accounts receivable; no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance. As of January 31, 2024, one customer accounted for approximately 
11
% of our accounts receivable; no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable balance.
Marketable Securities
We classify our investments in marketable securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets as the investments are available for use, if needed, in current operations as we may sell our marketable securities at any time, without significant penalty, even if they have not yet reached maturity. These investments are carried at fair value, based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are recognized when realized as a component of other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.
We review our securities on a regular basis to evaluate if any security has experienced an other-than temporary decline in fair value. We consider an available-for-sale security to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost basis, our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we are required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline exists in one of the securities, we will write down these investments to fair value. To the extent that the decline in fair value is related to credit losses, such as changes to the rating of the security by third-party rating agencies, and adverse conditions specific to the security, among other factors, the write-down related to credit loss would be recorded in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Impairments related to 
73

factors other than credit losses are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. As of January 31, 2025, the Company had not recorded any credit impairments.

Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Costs of maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred. Upon asset retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the consolidated balance sheets, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

The estimated useful lives for significant property and equipment categories are as follows:
Computer equipment, office equipment, and software
3
 to 
5
 years
Furniture and fixtures
7
 years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of lease term or estimated useful life of assets
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, subject to depreciation and amortization, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets or asset groups may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated. Recoverability of these assets or asset groups is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset or asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate over their remaining lives. If the asset or asset group is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset or asset group. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life.

2023.
Capitalized Internal-use Software Costs
We capitalize certain costs incurred to develop new or additional customer-facing software functionality, on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of property and equipment, net. We capitalize qualifying personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, and consulting costs incurred during the application development stage so long as the project is authorized, it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. These capitalized costs are amortized over the software’s expected useful life, which is generally 
three years
, within cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations.
Comprehensive Loss
Our comprehensive loss is currently comprised of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments.
Variable Interest Entity
A Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) is an entity that either has insufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or has equity investors who lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party with both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. 
To assess whether we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, we consider all the facts and circumstances including our role in establishing the VIE and our ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the party that makes the most significant decisions affecting the VIE is determined to have the power to direct the activities of the VIE. To assess whether we have the obligation to absorb the losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider all of our economic interests, including debt and equity interests, servicing rights and fee arrangements, and any other variable interests in the VIE. If we determine that we are the party with the power to make the most significant decisions 
74
Table 
of Contents
affecting the VIE, and we have an obligation to absorb the losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE, then we consolidate the VIE.
We perform ongoing reassessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, based on new events, and therefore could be subject to the VIE consolidation framework.
Redeemable Non-controlling Interest
Redeemable non-controlling interests represent the portion of net income (loss), net, and comprehensive income (loss), net, that is not allocable to us, in situations where we consolidate an equity interest or as the primary beneficiary of a VIE for which there are other owners. The amount of non-controlling interest is comprised of the greater of the amount of such interests at the date of the original acquisition of an equity interest in an investment, plus the other shareholders’ share of changes in equity since the date of the investment or estimated redemption value. The resulting changes in the estimated redemption amount (increases or decreases) are recorded with corresponding adjustments against retained earnings or, in the absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in-capital. The redeemable non-controlling interest is classified outside of permanent equity as mezzanine equity on the consolidated balance sheets as the redemption option is outside of our control.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenue primarily from subscriptions to our platform, including associated support, and professional services. Our subscriptions do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications and, as a result, are accounted for as service contracts. Professional services primarily consist of fees for distinct services rendered in training and assisting customers to configure and optimize the use of the platform. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to clients in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We apply the following five-step model to recognize revenue from contracts with clients:
•
Identification of the contract or contracts with a customer;
•
Identification of the performance obligation(s) in the contract;
•
Determination of the transaction price;
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and
•
Recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied.
We identify the performance obligations in a contract or multiple contracts with a customer and determine whether they are distinct or distinct within the context of the contract. When there is more than one distinct performance obligation in a contract, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis based on standalone selling prices (“SSP”). We have identified two performance obligations within our contracts with our customers: (i) subscription and (ii) professional services and other.
All contracts generally contain fixed consideration payable upfront by the customer. Some of our multi-year arrangements may contain fixed fees with escalating pricing structures each year. The nature of our subscription performance obligation remains unchanged each period of the arrangement and therefore may create a contract asset reflecting the difference between the amount of revenue recognized compared to the amount billed.
Some of our contracts with customers contain terms, such as service level guarantees, product usage and overage fees, that, along with various potential claims, including breach of warranty, may result in variable consideration. Variable consideration exists when the amount which we expect to receive in a contract is affected by the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events. We develop estimates of variable consideration on the basis of historical information, current trends, and any other specific knowledge about future periods.
Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Typically, our contracts do not provide customers with any right of return or refund; however, we may make exceptions on a case-by-case basis when it makes commercial sense. Variable consideration, including as a result of service level guarantees, product usage and overage fees or other potential claims such as breach of warranty, was not material during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023. We allocate the variable consideration related to the product usages and overages to the distinct month during which the related services were performed as those fees relate specifically to providing usage of the platform in the period and represents the consideration we are entitled to for the access to the platform. As a result, the usage and overage fees are included in the transaction price and recognized as revenue in the period in which the fee was generated.
75
Table 
of Contents
To the extent that we grant customers an option to acquire additional products or services, we account for the option as a distinct performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that the customer would not receive without entering into the contract. If a material right exists in a contract, revenue allocated to the option is deferred and recognized as revenue only when those future products or services are transferred or when the option expires. Contracts do not typically contain material rights and when they do, the material right has not been significant to our consolidated financial statements.
Once the transaction price is determined, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in a manner depicting the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the products or services to the customer. This allocation is based on the SSP of the products or services included in the arrangement.
Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each performance obligation. We determine SSP based on observable prices for those related goods or services when sold separately, if available. When such observable prices are not available, we determine SSP based on overarching pricing objectives and strategies, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including transaction size, product-specific factors, historical sales of the deliverables and costs to deliver the services and applicable margins.
Subscription Services
Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date the platform is made available to customers. We have determined that subscriptions to our platform represent a stand-ready obligation to perform over the subscription term. These performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits. Contracts are typically 
one year
 in length, but may be up to 
five years
.
At the beginning of each subscription term we invoice our customers, typically in annual installments but also quarterly and semi-annually. Amounts that have been invoiced for non-cancelable contracts are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue. We report revenue net of sales tax and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities.
Professional Services and Other
Professional services and other revenue primarily consist of onboarding services and are typically recognized as services are performed since our customers simultaneously receive the benefits of these services as they are performed, which is generally over a period of up to six months from provisioning access to the platform. We invoice our customers for professional services at the outset of the contract. Amounts that have been invoiced for non-cancelable contracts are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue. We report revenue net of sales tax and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities.
Contract Balances
Contract Assets
A contract asset is the right to consideration for transferred goods or services when the amount is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. These balances are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.
Deferred Revenue
We record deferred revenue when we have an unconditional right to payments in advance of satisfying the performance obligations on our contracts. The balance consists primarily of annual plan subscription services and professional services not yet provided as of the balance sheet date. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheets. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable agreements.
Deferred Contract Costs
We capitalize costs of obtaining revenue contracts that are incremental and recoverable. Incremental costs primarily include sales commissions and bonuses for new and renewal revenue contracts and associated payroll tax and fringe benefit costs and are recorded within deferred contract costs on the consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all customer contracts.
76
Table 
of Contents
Contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis up to 
four years
, which reflects the expected period of benefit of the performance obligation and may be longer than the initial contract period. We determined the estimated benefit period having considered both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the length of the subscription terms in our customer contracts and the anticipated life of our technology, among other such factors. Deferred contract costs related to renewals are amortized over the renewal term which is generally 
one year
 to 
three years
. Amortization of contract costs are classified within operating expenses based on the function of the underlying employee receiving the benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Deferred contract costs are periodically analyzed for impairment. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, we have not identified any potential indicators of impairment.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue consists of expenses related to providing platform access to customers and onboarding services. These costs include payments to third-party cloud infrastructure providers for hosting software solutions and costs associated with application service providers utilized to deliver the platform, allocated personnel-related costs, including salaries, cash-based performance compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation, overhead cost allocations related to facilities and shared IT-related expenses, including depreciation expense and amortization of internal use software.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, cash performance-based compensation, employee benefits and stock-based compensation. Operating expenses also include overhead cost allocations.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing organization, costs related to sponsorships, events and advertising, agency costs, travel-related expenses, and allocated overhead costs. Costs associated with our advertising and sales promotions are expensed as incurred. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we recognized $
30.3
 million, $
25.1
 million, and $
20.8
 million, respectively, in advertising costs, which included brand and sponsorship costs.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for engineering, service, design, and information technology teams. Additionally, research and development expenses include allocated overhead costs and contractor fees. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized internal-use software development costs are excluded from research and development expenses as they are capitalized as a component of property and equipment, net and amortized to cost of revenue over the software’s expected useful life, which is generally 
three years
.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance, legal, human resources and other administrative functions, as well as outside professional services. In addition, general and administrative expense includes non-personnel costs, such as legal, accounting and other professional fees, software costs, certain tax, license and insurance-related expenses and allocated overhead costs.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure our employee and director stock-based payment awards, including purchase rights issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, based on the award’s fair value as determined on the date of grant. 
We recognize stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the individual grant, generally equal to the vesting period, and use the straight-line method to recognize stock-based compensation. 
We estimate expected forfeitures of stock-based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest. We estimate our forfeitures rate based on an analysis of our actual historical forfeitures materializing in the previous fiscal years, and revise the estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We routinely evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover and expectations of future option exercise behavior.

Investment Income
Investment income consists primarily of income earned on our investments, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net, is primarily comprised of realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception by assessing whether the arrangement contains an identified asset and whether we have the right to control the identified asset. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets are based on the measurement of the lease liability and also include any lease payments made prior to or on lease commencement and exclude lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred, as applicable. 
As the implicit rate in our leases is generally unknown, we use the incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain we will exercise any such options. Lease costs for our operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term. The interest component of finance leases is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. We did not have any finance leases in the periods presented.
We have elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for any leases within our existing classes of assets and, as a result, we account for any lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We have also elected to not apply the recognition requirement to any leases within our existing classes of assets with a term of 12 months or less (short-term leases). Variable lease costs are comprised primarily of our proportionate share of operating expenses, property taxes, and insurance and is classified as lease cost due to our election to not separate lease and non-lease components.
Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, current operating lease liabilities, and non-current in our consolidated balance sheets.
 Refer to Note 14. Leases, for further information.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, using a more likely than not standard. The evaluation considers our recent historical operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would reduce the provision for income taxes. Conversely, in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, we would charge an adjustment to the valuation allowance to earnings in the period when such determination is made. As of January 31, 2025, we recorded a full valuation allowance in jurisdictions where we had net deferred tax assets, which consist of net operating loss carryforwards and other basis differences, as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized.
We recognize tax expense associated with Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income as it is incurred as part of the current income taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period.
We recognize the tax benefits on any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be realized upon ultimate settlement with tax authorities, assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

Business Combinations
The Company recognizes identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed, but these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, the Company may record adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.
The Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than its carrying amount. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment tests. The quantitative impairment test for goodwill involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. A goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. The impairment is limited to the carrying amount of goodwill. 
The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The estimates of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using a discounted cash flow valuation analysis that employs different valuation methodology in estimating the fair value of the asset. Significant judgments are inherent in the discounted cash flow analysis.
The Company has determined that it operates as one reporting unit and has selected November 1 as the date to perform its annual impairment test. No goodwill impairment charges have been recorded for any period presented.
Restructuring
Restructuring costs generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance payments, benefits, and certain facilitation costs, associated with our workforce reductions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon substantive severance plans, while some are mandated requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions. Severance costs generally include severance payments, health insurance coverage, and legal costs. These charges are reflected in the period when both the actions are probable, at the balance sheet date, and the amounts are reasonably estimable.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which enhances reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through expanded disclosures around significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 as of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, (“ASU 2023-09”), which requires public business entities on an annual basis to disclose specific categories in a tabular rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a five percent quantitative threshold. Additionally, the ASU requires all entities to disclose the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes, as well as individual jurisdictions where income taxes paid are equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the updated should be applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective

Variable Interest Entity and Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest
On September 14, 2020, we, along with Japan Cloud Computing Co., Ltd., and M30 LLC, (the “Investors”), entered into an agreement, whereby each Investor agreed to purchase shares of common stock of Braze Kabushiki Kaisha (“Braze KK” and “Braze KK Shares”) for a total purchase price of $
10.0
 million in two tranches of $
5.0
 million per tranche in September 2020 and September 2021, to engage in the investment, organization, management and operation of Braze KK focused on the distribution of our products in Japan. The purpose of this arrangement was to further expand our business in the Japanese market.
In March 2022, we consented to the periodic issuance of stock options to purchase Braze KK Shares by certain employees of Braze KK. These options cannot be exercised by the holders thereof prior to the exercise of the call or put options described in more detail below. The Company considers the stock options to be a substantive class of equity, classified as a liability within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. As of January 31, 2025, the liability balance was $

 million. The issuance of stock options does not impact our majority stake in Braze KK, as none of the vesting criteria of the options were met as of the balance sheet date. The issuance of stock options did not result in a reconsideration event and therefore Braze KK still met the criteria of a Variable Interest Entity as Braze KK did not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their activities. As a result, we continue to operate Braze KK as a subsidiary, exposing us to business and foreign exchange risk. We consolidate Braze KK and present the results within the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, and consolidated statements of cash flows.
The common stock held by the Investors is callable by us or puttable by the Investors upon certain contingent events.
 Should the call or put option be exercised, the redemption value would be determined based on a prescribed formula derived from the discrete revenues of Braze KK and the Company and may be settled, at our discretion, with our stock or cash. The non-controlling interest in Braze KK is classified in mezzanine equity as redeemable non-controlling interest as a result of the put right available to the Investors in the future, an event that is not solely in our control. The non-controlling interest is not accreted to redemption value because it is currently not probable that the non-controlling interest will become redeemable.

Our money market funds and financial instruments that are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, because they are valued using quoted prices in active markets as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024. Financial instruments classified as Level 2 within our fair value hierarchy are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. Prices of these securities are obtained through independent, third-party pricing services and include market quotations that may include both observable and unobservable inputs. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. 
The fair value of our contingent consideration is estimated using Level 3 unobservable inputs. The estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are uncertain, and involve significant judgments by management. We will reassess the fair value of the contingent consideration quarterly until the contingency is resolved. If applicable, changes in the fair value are recorded in operating income in the consolidated statements of operations. As of January 31, 2025, the Company reduced the contingent consideration liability to zero as it was determined that the likelihood of the sellers satisfying the qualifications is remote.
There were no transfers of financial instruments among Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 during the periods presented.

The Company purchases investment grade marketable debt securities which are rated by nationally recognized statistical credit rating organizations in accordance with its investment policy. This policy is designed to minimize the Company's exposure to credit losses. As of January 31, 2025, the credit-quality of the Company’s marketable available-for-sale debt securities had remained stable. The unrealized losses recognized on marketable available-for-sale debt securities as of January 31, 2025 was primarily related to the continued market volatility associated with market expectations in the current interest rate environment. The contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investments and it is not expected that the investments would be settled at a price less 
85

than their amortized cost basis. The Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require the Company to change its assessment of credit losses for any marketable available-for-sale debt security as of January 31, 2025. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized on the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known.

Stockholders’ Equity
Class A and Class B Common Stock
The Company has 
two
 classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. The rights of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, conversion, and transfer rights. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to 
one

ten
 votes and may be converted at the option of the holder into 
one
 share of Class A common stock. In addition, all shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock in certain circumstances, including on the earlier of (i) the last trading day of the fiscal quarter during which the number of shares of Class B common stock then outstanding represents less than 
10
% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, or (ii) the last trading day of the fiscal quarter immediately following the fifth anniversary of the initial public offering. All shares of the 
87
Table 
of Contents
Company’s capital stock outstanding immediately prior to our initial public offering, including all shares held by its executive officers, directors, and their respective affiliates, and all shares issuable upon the conversion of our then outstanding convertible preferred stock, were reclassified into shares of Class B common stock immediately prior to the completion of the initial public offering.

Employee Stock Plans
We have historically issued equity awards under our Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”) and our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”).
Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan
Our 2011 Plan provides for the award of stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to employees, officers, directors, advisors and other service providers of Braze. The terms of each award and the exercise price of awards under the 2011 Plan are determined by our board of directors. Following effectiveness of the 2021 Plan in connection with our initial public offering, no further awards were made under the 2011 Plan.
2021 Equity Incentive Plan
In November 2021, our board of directors and our stockholders approved the 2021 Plan, which became effective on November 16, 2021. No grants were made under the 2021 Plan prior to its effectiveness. No further grants will be made under the 2011 Plan. At effectiveness, we reserved 
25,660,249
 shares of our Class A common stock to be issued under the 2021 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan will automatically increase on February 1 of each year for a period of ten years, beginning on February 1, 2022 and continuing through February 1, 2031, in an amount equal to (1) 
5
% of the total number of shares of our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on the preceding January 31, or (2) a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors no later than the February 1 increase. On February 1, 2024, the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our 2021 Plan increased by an additional 
5,010,520

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In November 2021, our board of directors and our stockholders approved the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which became effective on November 16, 2021. Following completion of our initial public offering, the ESPP authorized the issuance of 
1,825,000
 shares of our Class A common stock under purchase rights granted to our employees or to employees of any of our designated affiliates. The number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance will automatically increase on February 1 of each year for a period of 
ten years
, beginning on February 1, 2022 and continuing through February 1, 2031, by the lesser of (i) 
1
% of the total number of shares of our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on the preceding January 31; and (ii) 
2,737,000
 shares, except before the date of any such increase, our board of directors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. On February 1, 2024, the number of shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our ESPP increased by an additional 
1,002,104
 shares.
89
Table 
of Contents
The ESPP is implemented through a series of offerings under which eligible employees are granted purchase rights to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A common stock on specified dates during such offerings. Under the ESPP, our board of directors will be permitted to specify offerings with durations of not more than 27 months, and may specify shorter purchase periods within each offering. Each offering will have one or more purchase dates on which shares of our Class A common stock will be purchased for employees participating in the offering. On each purchase date, eligible employees will purchase the shares at a price per share equal to 
85
% of the lesser of (1) the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or (2) the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock on the last day of the offering period, as defined by the ESPP.

We are subject to indirect taxation in some, but not all, of the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Therefore, we have an obligation to charge, collect and remit Value Added Tax (“VAT”) or Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) in connection with certain of our foreign sales transactions and sales and use tax in connection with eligible sales to subscribers in certain U.S. states. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion in South Dakota v. Wayfair. The State of South Dakota alleged that U.S. constitutional law should be revised to permit South Dakota to require remote sellers to collect and remit sales tax in South Dakota in accordance with South Dakota’s sales tax statute. Under the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling, the longstanding Quill Corp v. North Dakota sales tax case was overruled, and states may now require remote sellers to collect sales tax under certain circumstances. We began collecting sales tax in relevant jurisdictions for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019. As a result of this ruling and given the scope of our operations, taxing authorities continue to provide regulations that increase the complexity and risks to comply with such laws and could result in substantial liabilities, prospectively as well as retrospectively. Based on the information available, we continue to evaluate and assess the jurisdictions in which indirect tax nexus exists and believe that the indirect tax liabilities are adequate and reasonable. Due to the complexity and uncertainty around the application of these rules by taxing authorities, results may vary materially from expectations, and

we have recognized liabilities for contingencies related to state sales and use tax, VAT, and GST deemed probable and estimable totaling $
2.9
 million and $
1.0
 million as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Legal Contingencies
From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we are or may be involved in various legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or purported class actions related to, among other things, alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, labor and employment, wage and hour and other claims. We have been, and may in the future be, put on notice or sued by third-parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, including patent infringement. We accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of January 31, 2025, we believe that no material loss will be incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.

Leases
The Company’s lease portfolio consists solely of office space with lease terms ranging from approximately 
one
 to 
ten years
. Certain lease agreements include options to renew or terminate the lease, which are not reasonably certain to be exercised and therefore are not factored into the determination of lease payments.

As of January 31, 2025, we had NOL carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $
392.3
 million and $
284.2
 million, respectively. Under current law, U.S. federal NOLs incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of federal NOLs is limited to 80% of taxable income in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. Accordingly, $
352.9
 million of our NOLs may be carried forward indefinitely for federal tax purposes and $
39.4
 million, if not utilized, will expire at various times between 2035 and 2037. The majority of state NOLs if not utilized, will expire at various times between 2026 and 2045. We also had foreign NOL carryforwards as of January 31, 2025 of $
32.3
 million, the majority of which may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 31, 2024, we had NOL carryforwards for federal, state, and foreign income tax purposes of approximately $
355.4
 million, $
248.4
 million, and $
30.9
 million, respectively.
At January 31, 2025, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of $
21.8
 million, the majority of which are related to credits for research activities, and if not utilized, will expire between 2037 and 2045. As of January 31, 2024, the Company has tax credit carryforwards of $
11.9
 million.
IRC Sections 382 and 383 place a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by carryforward tax attributes, such as net operating losses or tax credits, after a change in control. Generally, after a change in control, a loss corporation cannot deduct carryforward tax attributes in excess of the limitation prescribed by Sections 382 and 383. Therefore, certain of our carryforward tax attributes may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods. As a result of issuances of different classes of preferred stock to investors in 2013, 2014 and 2017, we triggered “ownership shifts” as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and related provisions. These ownership shifts resulted in a reduction of NOLs in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 of $
13.8
 million and credits of $
0.7
 million. Our utilization of our NOLs and credits is limited by these ownership shifts but those limitations do not have a significant impact to the financial statements since there is no utilization of the NOLs and credits and a full valuation allowance exists against the net operating losses and credits. Subsequent ownership changes may subject us to additional annual limitations of its net operating losses. Such annual limitation could result in the expiration of the NOLs and credits.
We determine our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by considering both positive and negative evidence to ascertain whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, if any, the timing, and amount of which are uncertain. Due to our history of losses, we believe that it is not more likely than not that jurisdictions where we have net deferred tax assets can be realized as of January 31, 2025. Accordingly, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against these respective net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased by $
28.4
 million, and $
42.7
 million, during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, and 2024, respectively.
The Company has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations as of January 31, 2025 because the Company intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the United States. The amount of any unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings would not be material.

The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. As of January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 interest and penalties recorded.
As of January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, accrued unrecognized tax benefits were $

, and $

, respectively, and if recognized would affect the provision for income taxes, and our effective tax rate. 
We are subject to income tax examinations in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Our most significant operations are in the United States and the earliest open tax year subject to potential examination is the period ended January 31, 2022. However, amounts reported as NOLs from these prior tax periods also remain subject to review by most tax authorities.

Net Loss per Share
We compute the basic and diluted net loss per share of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are substantially identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock share in the Company’s net loss.

Business Combination
Acquisition of North Star Y, Pty Ltd
On June 1, 2023, the Company acquired all the outstanding stock of North Star Y, Pty Ltd (“North Star”), Braze’s exclusive reseller in Australia and New Zealand. The transaction provides Braze with a direct market presence in Australia and New Zealand, along with local market expertise from the North Star team.
The total purchase price consideration, as adjusted, of $
26.8
 million consisted of cash payments of $
20.6
 million, $
6.1
 million in issuances of Braze Class A common stock, and contingent consideration payments, the fair value of which was $
1.8
 million as of the acquisition date. The sellers are eligible to receive cash earn-out payments calculated based on qualified revenue performance metrics for the two individual twelve month periods immediately subsequent to the closing of the acquisition. The earn-out payments are capped at $
10.0
 million for the first earn-out period and $
16.0
 million for the second earn-out period. The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability has been influenced by developments in the significant inputs for such calculation, notably the new and incremental actual and forecasted deal closings from the Australia-New Zealand region. As a result, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, the Company reduced the contingent consideration liability to 
zero
 as it was determined that the likelihood of the sellers satisfying the qualifications is remote.
The preliminary purchase price, as adjusted, was allocated to intangible assets in the amount of $
3.8
 million and goodwill in the amount of $
28.4
 million based on the respective estimated fair values. The resulting goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. 
An indemnification holdback of $
2.8
 million that was previously recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets was extinguished during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. The indemnification holdback represents security for potential indemnification claims against the seller. The indemnification holdback was released in full.
Of the initial $
0.5
 million working capital holdback, $
0.3
 million has been released during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 based on the completion of post-close adjustment procedures. 
The results of operations of North Star, which were not material, have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025 and 2024.

Segments
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. Our Chief Executive Officer is the CODM. The Company derives revenues from customers by 
96
Table 
of Contents
providing cloud-based customer engagement platform subscriptions. The Company derives revenue primarily in North America and manages the business activities on a consolidated basis. As such, we have one operating segment, which is the customer engagement platform segment. 
The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. Intra-entity activities are eliminated at the consolidated level. The Company’s method for measuring performance on a single operating and reportable segment basis is net loss. Refer to the consolidated statements of operations. In assessing the performance of the business, the CODM regularly reviews consolidated expense information of both historical and forecasted periods to manage operations of the segment (i.e., the consolidated business). 
The CODM reviews assets for Braze’s single reportable segment on a consolidated basis. Refer to the consolidated balance sheets.

In February 2025, the Company granted RSUs for a total of 
45,961
 shares of Class A common stock to employees pursuant to the 2021 Plan. The RSUs vest over a service period of approximately 
four
 years. The grant date fair value of these awards was $
1.9
 million.
In March 2025, the Company granted RSUs for a total of 
2,359,558

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2025, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of January 31, 2025 because of the material weakness in our internal control, discussed below.
97
Table 
of Contents
Notwithstanding the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these controls were not effective as of January 31, 2025, due to material weaknesses in the operation of certain key Information Technology General Controls . Consequently, automated and information technology dependent manual business process controls that rely upon information from the information technology systems were also deemed ineffective.
Notwithstanding this material weakness noted above, management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this Annual Report fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this report. Additional detail on the nature of the material weaknesses, and management's conclusions can be found below.

We identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls, or ITGCs, in the areas of user access and program change management over the information technology systems that support our financial reporting processes. Automated and manual controls that rely on system-generated data or reports from the affected information technology environment or process level automated controls in the affected information technology environment were ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted.
Remediation Plan
We have developed a detailed plan for remediation of the material weakness, as well as compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including:
•
Enhancing controls and procedures over user access and program change management;
•
Strengthening our systems and IT compliance functions through targeted hiring, staff training and implementation of new IT policies; and
•
Engaging an external advisor to assist with control documentation, gap analysis and remediation monitoring.
While we have performed certain remediation activities to strengthen our controls to address the identified material weakness, control weaknesses are not considered remediated until new internal controls have been operational for a period of time, are tested, and management concludes that these controls are operating effectively. 
We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of our remediation measures in connection with our future assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, and we will make any changes to the design of our plan and take such other actions that we deem appropriate given the circumstances. We expect to complete the remediation process by the end of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ending January 31, 2026.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Other than the remediation efforts noted above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls

must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.
