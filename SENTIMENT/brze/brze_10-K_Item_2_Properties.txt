Item 2. Properties
Our headquarters is located in New York City, where we lease approximately 92,300 square feet pursuant to a lease that expires in January 2034. We also lease additional office space in over 10 cities across North America, South America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Middle East. These offices are leased, and we do not own any real property. We believe that our current facilities are generally suitable to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, to the extent we require additional space in the future, we believe that it would be readily available on commercially reasonable terms.
