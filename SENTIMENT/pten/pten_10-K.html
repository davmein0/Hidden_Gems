Substantial civil and criminal legal penalties can be imposed for violation of these laws.

The policies described in this memorandum are complementary to that broad prohibition and apply to all Company directors and executive officers and to other designated officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who have been designated based on their regular access to internal Company financial and other material information as well as their Family Members and Controlled Entities (as defined in the Insider Trading Policy).  The Advance Notification Group (as defined in Part V of this Memorandum) is also subject to procedures for advance notification of proposed transactions as set forth in Part V.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Recipients of this memorandum who are directors or Section 16 reporting officers should also refer to a separate memorandum entitled &#8220;U.S. Federal Securities Law Considerations&#8221; covering matters under Section 16 and Rule 144.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-36pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%">I.</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%;padding-left:29.61pt">Restrictions on Trading</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">General Policy</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">.

A &#8220;no trade&#8221; period will, therefore, begin on each of December 20, March 20, June 20 and September 20.

From time to time, the Company may recommend, or require, that directors, officers, selected employees and others (including their Family Members and Controlled Entities) refrain from trading because of developments known to the Company and not yet disclosed to the public.  In such a case, the persons so advised should not trade Company securities until advised that the restriction has been terminated and should not disclose to others inside or outside of the Company the fact that the Company has imposed a trading restriction.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Directors and officers of a public company are prohibited from purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring equity securities of that company during specified pension fund blackout periods if the director or officer acquires the equity securities in connection with service or employment.

The existence of blackout periods and situation-specific trading restrictions should not be considered a safe harbor for trading during other periods, and all directors, officers and other employees should use good judgment at all times.  For example, occasions may arise when individuals covered by this memorandum become aware prior to the beginning of the quarterly blackout period that earnings for that quarter are likely to exceed, or fall below, market expectations to an extent that is material.  In such a case, those individuals should refrain from trading even prior to the normal commencement of the quarterly blackout period.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">.  SEC Rule 10b5-1 provides generally that a purchase or sale is &#8220;on the basis of&#8221; material nonpublic information if the person engaging in the transaction is aware of the material nonpublic information when the person makes the purchase or sale.  In addition, the rule creates an exception to this general rule that is available if the person demonstrates that, before becoming aware of any material nonpublic information, the person had entered into a binding contract to purchase or sell the security, had instructed another person to purchase or sell the security for the instructing person&#8217;s account, or had adopted a written plan for trading securities, and (in each case) the contract, instruction or plan meets certain requirements. The contract, instruction or plan must also be entered into in good faith and without any purpose of evading the prohibitions of the SEC&#8217;s rules, and persons utilizing such a contract, instruction or plan must have acted in good faith with respect to the contract, instruction or plan.  (In some circumstances, terminating or modifying a contract, instruction or plan that is in place could call into question whether it was entered into in good faith.) If adopted by a director or Section 16 reporting officer (or their Family Members or Controlled Entities), any such contract, instruction or plan must include a representation by the adopting person that such person is not aware of any material nonpublic information and is adopting the contract, instruction or plan in good faith and without any purpose of evading the prohibitions of the SEC&#8217;s rules.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Persons subject to the Insider Trading Compliance Policy may enter into such a plan (a &#8220;10b5- 1 trading plan&#8221;), in which case restrictions on trading otherwise applicable under this memorandum will not apply to the extent transactions are executed in compliance with the plan and applicable law.  A 10b5-1 trading plan may not be entered into at a time when the person entering into it is aware of material nonpublic information and may not be entered into during a quarterly blackout period.  The 10b5-1 trading plan must be reviewed and approved by the Legal Department prior to its adoption.  If you wish to implement a 10b5-1 trading plan, you must first pre-clear the plan with the Legal Department prior to the entry into the plan in accordance with the procedures set forth in Part V of this memorandum.  SEC rules provide for a &#8220;cooling-off&#8221; period before trading takes place under a 10b5-1 trading plan.  For directors and officers (and their Family Members and Controlled Entities), trading cannot begin until the later of&#58;  (a) 90 days after the adoption of the 10b5-1 trading plan&#59; or (b) two business days following the disclosure of the Company&#8217;s financial results in a Form 10-Q or 10-K for the fiscal quarter in which the 10b5-1 trading plan was adopted (although in no event will such cooling-off period exceed 120 days).  The cooling-off period is 30 days after adoption of the 10b5-1 trading plan for all other persons (other than the Company).</font></div><div style="height:72pt;position:relative;width:100%"><div style="bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%"><div style="text-align:center"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:12pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">- 2 -</font></div></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div style="min-height:72pt;width:100%"><div style="text-align:justify"><font><br></font></div></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">With certain exceptions, which may be discussed with legal counsel, SEC rules also provide for restrictions on entering into multiple overlapping 10b5-1 trading plans effecting trades at the same time.  SEC rules also prohibit you from entering into more than one 10b5-1 trading plan designed to effect the open-market purchase or sale of the total amount of securities as a single transaction during any rolling 12-month period.  A single-transaction plan is &#8220;designed to effect&#8221; the purchase or sale of securities as a single transaction when the terms of the plan would, for practical purposes, directly or indirectly require execution in a single transaction.  A 10b5-1 trading plan that authorizes an agent to sell only such securities as are necessary to satisfy tax withholding obligations arising exclusively from the vesting of a compensatory award, such as restricted stock, restricted stock units or stock appreciation rights (but not options), and over which you do not otherwise exercise control over the timing of such sales (an &#8220;eligible STC 10b5-1 trading plan&#8221;), is not subject to the limitations set forth in this paragraph.  Prior to adoption, an eligible STC 10b5-1 trading plan must meet all other requirements set forth in this memorandum.  The SEC rules governing 10b5-1 trading plans are complex, and the compliance of any 10b5-1 trading plan with the applicable SEC rules is the responsibility of the person entering into such plan.  You are advised to consult with legal counsel if you choose to enter into a 10b5-1 trading plan.  In addition, it is the Company&#8217;s policy that 10b5-1 trading plans are subject to the advance notification procedures described in Part V of this memorandum prior to their implementation.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">SEC rules also provide that the Company must make certain disclosures following any directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; adoption or termination of 10b5-1 trading plans.  Accordingly, directors or officers should be aware that information regarding their 10b5-1 trading plans, including the duration of the arrangement and total securities to be sold or purchased, will be publicly disclosed in the Company&#8217;s SEC filings.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Modifications&#47;amendments and terminations of an existing 10b5-1 trading plan are strongly discouraged due to legal risks, and can affect the validity of trades that have taken place under the plan prior to such modification&#47;amendment or termination.  Under Rule 10b5-1 and our policies, any modification&#47;amendment to the amount, price, or timing of the purchase or sale of the securities underlying the 10b5-1 trading plan will be deemed to be a termination of the current 10b5-1 trading plan and creation of a new 10b5-1 trading Plan, and will be subject to all requirements applicable to the adoption of a new 10b5-1 trading plan (e.g., the 10b5-1 plan is required to be adopted during an open trading window, will be subject to the cooling-off period described above, etc.).  If you are considering administerial changes to your 10b5-1 trading plan, such as changing the account information or the broker administering your plan, you should consult with the Legal Department in advance to confirm that any such change does not constitute an effective termination of your plan.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> As such, the modification&#47;amendment of an existing 10b5-1 trading plan must be reviewed and approved in advance by the Legal Department in accordance with advance notice procedures set forth in Part V of this memorandum, and will be subject to all the other requirements set forth in this memorandum regarding the adoption of a new 10b5-1 trading plan.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, the termination (other than through an amendment or modification) of an existing 10b5-1 trading plan must be reviewed and approved in advance by the Legal Department in accordance with advance notice procedures set forth in Part V of this memorandum.

When a person engages in a transaction involving a put or a call option on Company stock, that person is in effect speculating on future movements in the Company&#8217;s stock price.  Because of the inherently speculative nature of options, purchasing or selling options or writing options (becoming obligated to perform under an option contract) on Company stock by a director, officer or employee can have the appearance of impropriety, even if the individual engaging in the transaction does not have any material nonpublic information at the time of the transaction.

These transactions would allow the holder to continue to own the covered securities, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the holder&#8217;s interests and the interests of the Company may be misaligned and may signal a message to the trading market that may not be in the best interests of the Company at the time it is conveyed. Similarly, securities held in a margin account may be sold by the broker without the customer&#8217;s consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Likewise, securities pledged (or hypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. A margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledger is aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in Company securities during quarterly blackout periods.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Recipients of this memorandum who are directors or executive officers (including their spouses and minor children) are prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions involving Company securities or pledging Company securities under the Company&#8217;s policy entitled &#8220;Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging.&#8221;</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In light of the concerns discussed above, all other recipients of this memorandum are strongly discouraged from engaging in hedging or pledging transactions involving Company securities and any such transactions are subject to all the other requirements set forth in this memorandum.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-indent:36pt"><font><br></font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-36pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%">IV.</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:100%;padding-left:22.39pt">Application of Policy to Transactions Associated with Option Exercises</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Whether option exercises and associated transactions are subject to the trading restrictions described in Part I of this memorandum, including the quarterly blackout period, depends on the nature of the exercise transaction and, in particular, whether there is an associated sale.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If you exercise an option by paying the exercise price in cash and do not sell the shares acquired, you need not observe any such trading restrictions.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If you exercise through a broker&#8217;s cashless exercise procedure (which involves a market sale by the broker), or if you otherwise make a contemporaneous sale of the shares you acquire on exercise, you must observe such trading restrictions just as you would for an ordinary market transaction.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:12pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:72pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">If you elect to fund any tax withholding obligations related to the exercise of an option by instructing the plan administrator to cause the sale of shares deliverable under the option or by selling shares you already own, you must observe such trading restrictions in exercising the option.

Consistent with the foregoing, you should be discreet with nonpublic information and refrain from discussing it in public places where it can be overheard, such as elevators and other public spaces in the Company&#8217;s offices, restaurants, taxis and airplanes.  Likewise, you should take care to protect sensitive information from access by unauthorized persons, for example, by allowing sensitive information displayed on a laptop computer to be viewed by someone sitting next to you on an airplane.

Chances are, if a person learns something that leads that person to want to buy or sell securities, the information will be considered material.  Thus, even speculative information can be material, and information may be material even if that information alone would not determine an investor&#8217;s decision to buy, sell or hold.  Furthermore, the SEC takes the view that, subject to the affirmative defenses under Rule 10b5-1 referred to in Part I above, the mere fact that a person knows the information is enough to bar him or her from trading, even if the reasons for the potential trade are not based on that information.  By way of example, the following information is often deemed material&#58;  annual or quarterly financial results for the entire company or a material business segment of the company (or even monthly results under certain circumstances, including in particular when they would indicate a material departure from market expectations)&#59; extraordinary borrowing or liquidity problems&#59; changes in control&#59; unexpected or unusual gains or losses in major operations&#59; negotiations and agreements regarding acquisitions, divestitures, business combinations or tender offers&#59; the institution of, or developments in, significant pending, threatened or actual litigation, investigations, or regulatory actions and proceedings, or strategies with respect to the foregoing&#59; internal earnings or other financial estimates or forecasts, especially if significantly different from &#8220;street&#8221; estimates, and other confidential financial information, including changes in dividend policy&#59; significant operational information, including results of drilling or pressure pumping activity, changes in price, customers, suppliers, or contracts or changes in management, directors, or auditors&#59; the declaration of a stock split or the proposed or contemplated issuance, redemption, or repurchase of securities (including the establishment of a repurchase program for Company securities)&#59; material defaults under agreements or actions by creditors, clients, or suppliers relating to a company&#8217;s credit rating&#59; marketing changes&#59; the interruption of production or other aspects of a company&#8217;s business as a result of an accident, fire, natural disaster, or breakdown of labor negotiations or any major shut-down&#59; labor negotiations&#59; major environmental incidents&#59; and significant actual or potential cybersecurity incidents, events or risks that affect the Company or third-party providers that support the Company&#8217;s business operations, including computer system or network compromises, viruses or other destructive software, and data breach incidents that may disclose personal, business or other confidential information.  This list of examples is not intended to be exhaustive, and other types of information may also be material.  Federal, state and Nasdaq investigators will scrutinize a questionable trade after the fact with the benefit of hindsight, so you should consider erring on the side of deciding that the information is material and not trade.

Selective disclosure to a few persons does not make information public and enough time has elapsed to permit the investment market to absorb and evaluate the information.

The appropriate period between an announcement and a subsequent trade depends on the nature of the information disclosed.

If a securities transaction becomes the subject of scrutiny, the transaction will be viewed after the fact.
