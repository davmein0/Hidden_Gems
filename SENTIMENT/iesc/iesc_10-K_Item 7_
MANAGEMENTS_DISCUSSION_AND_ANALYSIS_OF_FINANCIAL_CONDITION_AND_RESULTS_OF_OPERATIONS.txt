DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes certain statements that may be deemed “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, all of which are based upon various estimates and assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable as of the date hereof. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “pursue,” “target,” “continue,” the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company’s actual future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
•
a general reduction in the demand for our products or services;
•
changes in general economic conditions, including supply chain constraints, high rates of inflation, changes in consumer sentiment, elevated interest rates, and market disruptions resulting from a number of factors, including geo-political events such as the Ukraine-Russia war, the conflict in the Middle East, and trade tensions between the U.S. and China; 
•
competition in the industries in which we operate, both from third parties and former employees, which could result in the loss of one or more customers or lead to lower margins on new projects;
•
our ability to successfully manage and execute projects, the cost and availability of qualified labor and the ability to maintain positive labor relations, and our ability to pass along increases in the cost of commodities used in our business, in particular, copper, aluminum, steel, fuel, electronic components and certain plastics; 
•
supply chain disruptions due to our suppliers' access to materials and labor, their ability to ship products timely, or credit or liquidity problems they may face;
•
inaccurate estimates used when entering into fixed-price contracts, the possibility of errors when estimating revenue and progress to date on percentage-of-completion contracts, and complications associated with the incorporation of new accounting, control and operating procedures;
•
our ability to enter into, and the terms of, future contracts;
•
the existence of a small number of customers from whom we derive a meaningful portion of our revenues;
•
reliance on third parties, including subcontractors and suppliers, to complete our projects;
•
the inability to carry out plans and strategies as expected, including the inability to identify and complete acquisitions that meet our investment criteria in furtherance of our corporate strategy, or the subsequent underperformance of those acquisitions;
•
challenges integrating new businesses into the Company or new types of work, products or processes into our segments;
•
backlog that may not be realized or may not result in profits;
•
failure to adequately recover on contract change orders or claims against customers; 
•
closures or sales of our facilities resulting in significant future charges, including potential warranty losses or other unexpected liabilities, or a significant disruption of our operations;
•
the impact of future epidemics or pandemics on our business, including the potential for new or continued job site closures or work stoppages, supply chain disruptions, delays in awarding new project bids, construction delays, reduced demand for our services, delays in our ability to collect from our customers, or illness of management or other employees;
•
an increased cost of surety bonds affecting margins on work and the potential for our surety providers to refuse bonding or require additional collateral at their discretion;
•
the impact of seasonality, adverse weather conditions, and climate change;
1
•
fluctuations in operating activity due to factors such as cyclicality, downturns in levels of construction or the housing market, and differing regional economic conditions;
•
difficulties in managing our billings and collections;
•
accidents resulting from the physical hazards associated with our work and the potential for accidents;
•
the possibility that our current insurance coverage may not be adequate or that we may not be able to obtain policies at acceptable rates;
•
the effect of litigation, claims and contingencies, including warranty losses, damages or other latent defect claims in excess of our existing reserves and accruals;
•
costs and liabilities under existing or potential future laws and regulations, including those laws and regulations related to the environment and climate change, as well as the inability to transfer, renew and obtain electrical and other professional licenses;
•
interruptions to our information systems and cyber security or data breaches;
•
expenditures to conduct environmental remediation activities required by certain environmental laws and regulations;
•
loss of key personnel, ineffective transition of new management, or general labor constraints;
•
credit and capital market conditions, including changes in interest rates that affect the cost of construction financing and mortgages, and the inability of some of our customers to obtain sufficient financing at acceptable rates, which could lead to project delays or cancellations;
•
limitations on our ability to access capital markets and generate cash from operations to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditures, to complete acquisitions, and for debt service; 
•
the impact on our effective tax rate or cash paid for taxes from changes in tax positions we have taken or changes in tax laws;
•
difficulty in fulfilling the covenant terms of our revolving credit facility, including liquidity, and other financial requirements, which could result in a default and acceleration of any indebtedness under such revolving credit facility;
•
reliance on certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results in the preparation of our financial statements;
•
uncertainties inherent in the use of percentage-of-completion accounting, which could result in the reduction or elimination of previously recorded revenues and profits;
•
the recognition of potential goodwill, long-lived assets and other investment impairments;
•
the existence of a controlling shareholder, who has the ability to take action not aligned with other shareholders or to dispose of all or a significant portion of the shares of our common stock it holds, which may trigger certain change of control provisions in a number of our material agreements, including our financing and surety arrangements and our executive severance plan;
•
the relatively low trading volume of our common stock, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares;
•
the possibility that we issue additional shares of common stock, preferred stock or convertible securities that will dilute the percentage ownership interest of existing stockholders and may dilute the value per share of our common stock;
•
the potential for substantial sales of our common stock, which could adversely affect our stock price;
•
the impact of increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors and customers, or new or changing regulations, with respect to environmental, social and governance practices;
•
the cost or effort required for our shareholders to bring certain claims or actions against us, as a result of our designation of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings; and
•
the possibility that our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent all possible errors that could occur.
You should understand that the foregoing, as well as other risk factors discussed in this document, including those listed in Part I, Item 1A. “
