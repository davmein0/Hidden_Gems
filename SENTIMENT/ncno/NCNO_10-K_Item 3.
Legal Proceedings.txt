CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies and plans, trends, market sizing, competitive position, industry environment, potential growth opportunities and product capabilities, among other things. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and, in some cases, can be identified by terms such as “aim,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “goal,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “seeks,” “should,” “strive,” “will,” “would,” or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms. As used in this report, the terms “nCino,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” mean nCino, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including those described in “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and elsewhere in this report. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include, but are not limited to:
•
our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses, and our ability to achieve and maintain future profitability;
•
our ability to execute strategies, plans, objectives, and goals;
•
our ability to compete with existing and new competitors in existing and new markets and offerings;
•
our ability to develop and protect our brand;
•
our ability to effectively manage privacy and information and data security;
•
costs associated with research and development and building out our sales, professional services and customer support teams;
•
the concentration of our customer base in the financial institution ("FI") sector and their spending on cloud-based technology;
•
our ability to add and retain customers;
•
our ability to expand internationally and associated costs;
•
our ability to comply with laws and regulations;

our expectations and management of future growth based on subscription revenues over the term of our customer contracts;
•
our expectations concerning relationships with our customers, partners, and other third parties;
•
geopolitical conflicts, economic uncertainties, trade sanctions, inflationary pressures and fluctuating interest rates;
•
economic and industry trends;

our ability to successfully integrate and realize the benefits from acquisitions and other strategic transactions;

Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, we disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future. In addition, statements such as “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date on which it is made and, although we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted a thorough inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. Furthermore, if our forward-looking statements prove to be inaccurate, the inaccuracy may be material. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by us or any other person that we will achieve our objectives and plans in any specified timeframe, or at all. Except as required by applicable law, we do not plan to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether as a result of any new information, future events, or otherwise.
