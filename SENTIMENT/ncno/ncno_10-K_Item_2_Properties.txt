Item 2. Properties
Our headquarters are located in Wilmington, North Carolina where we lease several facilities encompassing approximately 224,000 square feet plus a 648-space parking deck. The leases relating to approximately 180,000 square feet of those facilities plus an adjacent parking deck expire in October 2037, each with options to extend and a purchase option that expires if not exercised on or before November 30, 2026. We have additional domestic offices in the U.S. and international offices in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, Spain, New Zealand and South Africa. All of our offices are leased, and we do not own any real property.
We believe our facilities are adequate for our current needs. We believe that we will be able to obtain additional space on commercially reasonable terms.
