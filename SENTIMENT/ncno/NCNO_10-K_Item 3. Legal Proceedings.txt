Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Market Information for Common Stock
Our common stock has been listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “NCNO” since July 14, 2020. Prior to that date, there was no public trading market for our common stock.
Stockholders
As of January 31, 2025, there were 90 holders of record of our common stock. Because many of such shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
Dividends Policy
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, to fund the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. Our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock may be limited by any future debt instruments or preferred securities.

“Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024.
Overview
As employees at financial institutions do their daily work and serve their clients, they often face inefficiencies from disparate systems, broken workflows, manual processes, and the inability to harness and utilize data effectively. This negatively impacts risk management, decision making and the experiences of bankers and their clients.
To solve the problem, FIs need technology that helps them reengineer every experience, intelligently and with agility as market needs shift, and a partner with the experience to help advise on best practices.
nCino's trusted platform enables FIs to consolidate vendors while optimizing operations by integrating AI and actionable insights to cohesively bring together people and data and thereby enhance strategic decision-making, risk management, and customer satisfaction. 
From managing complex credit portfolios to streamlining account onboarding and originating loans, nCino helps FIs of all sizes globally deliver faster, intelligent, and more connected experiences. With the nCino Platform, FIs can:
•
embrace the power of intelligent automation and uncover data-driven insights,
•
improve efficiency,
•
elevate employee and customer experience,
•
manage risk and helping to ensure compliance more effectively,
nCino was originally founded in a bank to improve that institution's operations and client service. After realizing that virtually all banks and credit unions were dealing with the same problems—cumbersome legacy technology, fragmented data, disconnected business functions, and a disengaged workforce made it difficult to maintain relevancy in their clients' lives—nCino was spun out as a separate company in late 2011 to help more institutions solve these challenges using cloud-based technology. 
We initially focused on developing the nCino Platform to transform commercial and small business lending for community and regional banks in the United States ("U.S."). We scaled the platform to enterprise banks in the U.S. in 2014, and then internationally in 2017. We have subsequently expanded across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Japan and Asia-Pacific ("APAC"). 
nCino's approach to market expansion includes strategically building products and acquiring technology to continue to fulfill a platform vision. Over the years, we built and enhanced products internally to ensure innovation and seamless integration across key solutions lines of commercial, small business and consumer banking. Through the strategic acquisitions of SimpleNexus, DocFox, FullCircl, ILT, Visible Equity, FinSuite, and our recent acquisition of Sandbox Banking, we significantly augmented the nCino's Platform's capabilities for mortgage lending, onboarding, account opening, indirect auto lending, and advanced analytics and AI. This strategic approach has allowed us to create a unified platform of best-in-class intelligent solutions, enabling FIs to replace multiple legacy systems, connect their operations, and streamline workflows and processes across various business lines to achieve desired business impact and process improvement. 
We generally offer the nCino Platform on a subscription basis pursuant to non-cancellable multi-year contracts that are typically three to five years. nCino has evolved from being a single product workflow solution to offering a platform of best-in-class, intelligent solutions. Our new Intelligent Solution Framework pricing model helps ensure the value-based positioning and pricing of our products and creates an opportunity to embed intelligence into all our solutions. Starting in fiscal 2025, by moving away from a seat-based pricing model to pricing directly correlated to the FI's assets, we are aligning our revenues to the usefulness the nCino Platform provides as nCino creates efficiencies for our customers. For fiscal 2025, we had a subscription revenue net retention rate of 110%. See Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Our Operating Results—Subscription Revenue Net Retention Rate” for additional information on subscription revenue retention rates.
We sell our solutions directly through our business development managers, account executives, field sales engineers, and customer success managers. Our sales efforts in the U.S. are organized around FIs based on size, whereas 
35
Table of Contents
internationally, we focus our sales efforts by geography. As of January 31, 2025, we had 194 sales and sales support personnel in the U.S. and 136 sales and support personnel in offices outside the U.S.
To help customers go live with our solutions, we offer professional services including configuration and implementation, training, and advisory services. For enterprise FIs, we generally work with SI partners such as Accenture, Deloitte, and PwC for the delivery of professional services for the nCino Platform. For regional FIs, we work with SIs such as West Monroe Partners, and for community banks, we work with SIs or perform configuration and implementation ourselves. We expect enterprise FIs to make up a greater proportion of our nCino Platform sales.
On March 20, 2024 (the "DocFox Acquisition Date"), we acquired DocFox, Inc. ("DocFox") which provides a solution for automating onboarding experiences for commercial and business banking, for an aggregate preliminary purchase price of $74.3 million. We funded the purchase consideration with $75.0 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility. We acquired Integrated Lending Technologies, LLC ("ILT") on April 1, 2024 (the "ILT Acquisition Date"), which provides consumer loan origination software that streamlines direct and indirect lending operations, for an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million in cash. On November 5, 2024 (the "FullCircl Acquisition Date"), we acquired Artesian Solutions Limited, operating as FullCircl ("FullCircl"), a UK-based SaaS platform built to help FIs automate and accelerate onboarding and improve client lifecycle management. We funded $129.2 million of the purchase consideration with borrowings made in October 2024 under our revolving credit facility. See Note 6 "Business Combinations" and Note 14 "Revolving Credit Facility" of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. We have included the financial results of DocFox, ILT and FullCircl in the consolidated financial statements from the DocFox Acquisition Date, the ILT Acquisition Date, and the FullCircl Acquisition Date, respectively.
Our total revenues were $408.3 million, $476.5 million, and $540.7 million for fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively, representing a 15.1% compound annual growth rate. Our subscription revenues were $344.8 million, $409.5 million, and $469.2 million for fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025, representing a 16.7% compound annual growth rate. Our total subscription revenues include an aggregate of $12.3 million from DocFox, ILT, and FullCircl for fiscal 2025. We recorded net losses attributable to nCino in fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025 of $102.7 million, $42.3 million, and $37.9 million, respectively. For fiscal 2025, our financial results include the operating results of DocFox, ILT and FullCircl from the DocFox Acquisition Date, the ILT Acquisition Date, and the FullCircl Acquisition Date, respectively.
In February 2025, we acquired Alphapack, Co. dba Sandbox Banking ("Sandbox Banking"), a digital transformation leader serving the financial services industry, for an aggregate purchase price of $52.5 million, subject to customary adjustments, with an additional earn-out opportunity of up to $10.0 million. This acquisition strengthens our ability to enhance data connectivity and streamline operations for banks and credit unions through an industry-leading Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) solution for a more intelligent and harmonious technology platform. See Note 20 "Subsequent Events" of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Factors Affecting Our Operating Results
Market Adoption of Our Solution
. Our future growth depends on our ability to expand our reach to new FI customers and increase adoption with existing customers as they broaden their use of our solutions within and across lines of business. Our success in growing our customer base and expanding adoption of our solutions by existing customers requires a focused direct sales engagement and the ability to convince key decision makers at FIs to replace legacy third-party point solutions or internally developed software with our solutions. Our ability to successfully implement our new asset-based pricing model that formally started in fiscal 2025 will also be a key driver. In addition, growing our customer base will require us to increasingly penetrate markets outside the U.S., which accounted for 21.5% of total revenues for fiscal 2025. For new customers, our sales cycles are typically lengthy, generally ranging from 6 to 9 for smaller FIs to 12 to 18 months or more for larger FIs. Key to landing new customers is our ability to successfully take our existing customers live and help them achieve measurable returns on their investment, thereby turning them into referenceable accounts. If we are unable to successfully address the foregoing challenges, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability will be adversely affected, which may in turn reduce the value of our common stock.
Mix of Subscription and Professional Services Revenues.
 The initial deployment of our solutions by our customers requires a period of implementation and configuration services that typically average less than six months, but may extend beyond twelve months depending on scope. As a result, during the initial go-live period for a customer on the nCino Platform, professional services revenues generally make up a substantial portion of our revenues from that customer, whereas over time, revenues from established customers are more heavily weighted to subscriptions. While professional services 
36
Table of Contents
revenues will fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues, we expect subscription revenues will continue to make up an increasing proportion of our total revenues.
Subscription Revenue Net Retention Rate
. We believe that our ability to retain and grow subscription revenues from our existing customers over time strengthens the stability and predictability of our revenue base and is reflective of both the adoption curve of customers and the value we deliver to them. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as subscription revenue net retention rate. We calculate our subscription revenue net retention rate as total subscription revenues in a fiscal year from customers who contributed subscription revenues in the prior fiscal year, expressed as a percentage of total subscription revenues for the prior fiscal year. In accordance with this definition, subscription revenues from customers obtained through an acquisition will first be included in the calculation in the fiscal year subsequent to such acquisition, for the periods they were a customer of nCino. Our subscription revenue net retention rate provides insight into the impact on current year subscription revenues of:
•
the number and timing of new customers, subscription fees to be charged existing customers in successive years, and phased activation of seats purchased by them in prior years, which activation schedules can span several fiscal years for larger contracts;
•
expanding adoption of our solutions by our existing customers during the current year; and
•
customer attrition.
For fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025, we had subscription revenue net retention rates of 144%, 116%, and 110%, respectively. The most significant driver of changes in our subscription revenue net retention rate each year has historically been the number of new customers in prior years and the associated phased activation schedules for such customers. In addition, because larger FIs tend to make more sizable purchases, we expect variability in our subscription revenue net retention rates based on the timing and extent of our continued penetration of this portion of the market. Excluding our U.S. mortgage business, the subscription revenue net retention rate for fiscal 2023 was 124%. The moderation in our subscription revenue net retention rate for fiscal 2024 was due to a decline in revenues from customers adversely affected by an increase in mortgage interest rates, from the expiration of licenses utilized for forgiveness monitoring of Paycheck Protection Program loans, and from the acquisition of certain customers by entities that do not currently use our solutions. The moderation in our subscription revenue net retention rate for fiscal 2025 was due primarily to a decline in revenues from customers adversely affected by an increase in mortgage interest rates, and from the acquisition of certain customers by entities that do not currently use our solutions. Our use of subscription revenue net retention rate has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in adjacent markets may calculate subscription revenue net retention rates or similar metrics differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. For fiscal 2025, we refined our methodology for calculating subscription revenue net retention rate to align with the details disclosed in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations regarding the change in subscription revenues. Using our prior calculation methodology, subscription revenue retention rate was 148%, 117%, 112% for fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively. 
ACV Net Retention Rate
. A key element of our growth strategy is to expand our deployed footprint with a customer after initial adoption. Our customers typically purchase the nCino Platform for a defined line of business or to support a specific use case and, once deployed, we seek to convince the customer to adopt our solutions within and across additional lines of business. To date, we have been successful in executing our land and expand strategy as a result of the ability of our solutions to streamline workflow, generate meaningful insights for operational improvement, and help drive improved bottom line results. Our historical net retention rates may not be predictive of future results. If our customers do not continue to see the ability of our solutions to generate return on investment relative to other available solutions or at all, ACV net retention rates could suffer and our operating results could be adversely affected.
We believe our ACV net retention rate over the long term illustrates our success in executing our land and expand strategy, as it demonstrates growing adoption by existing customers, including price increases but net of attrition. We define ACV net retention rate as total ACV at the end of a fiscal year from customers with ACV as of the end of the prior fiscal year, expressed as a percentage of ACV as of the end of the prior fiscal year, converted to U.S. dollar with foreign exchange rates in effect as of the end of the applicable period. We define ACV as the highest annualized subscription fee obligation under customer contracts in effect at the end of the reporting period. ACV net retention rate can occasionally moderate from one period to the next, from customer attrition for example. Our ACV net retention rate was 105%, 102%, and 106% for fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively.

The moderation in our ACV net retention rate for fiscal 2024 was due to a decline in ACV from customers adversely affected by an increase in mortgage interest rates, from the expiration of licenses utilized for 
37
Table of Contents
forgiveness monitoring of Paycheck Protection Program loans, and from the acquisition of customers by non-customers. The increase in our ACV net retention rate for fiscal 2025 was attributable to increased ACV from customers who expanded their adoption of our solutions, offset in part due to a decline in ACV from customers adversely affected by an increase in mortgage rates.
Macroeconomic Environment.
 We are currently operating in a fluctuating interest rate environment with inflationary pressures. These fluctuations have had an impact on the real estate market in the U.S. and specifically, the demand for mortgages and mortgage-related products and services, which has had a negative impact on our U.S. mortgage business. 
We will continue to monitor the impact the macroeconomic environment may have on our business.
Continued Investment in Innovation and Growth
. We have made substantial investments in product development, sales and marketing, and strategic acquisitions since our inception to achieve a leadership position in our market and grow our revenues and customer base. We intend to continue to increase our investment in product development in the coming years to maintain and build on this advantage. We also intend to invest in sales and marketing both in the U.S. and internationally to further grow our business. To capitalize on the market opportunity we see ahead of us, we expect to continue to optimize our operating plans for revenue growth and profitability.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenues
We derive our revenues from subscription and professional services and other revenues.
Subscription Revenues
. Our subscription revenues consist principally of fees from customers for accessing our solutions and maintenance and support services that we generally offer under non-cancellable multi-year contracts, which are typically three to five years in length, we offer:
•
Client onboarding, loan origination, and deposit account opening solutions targeted at a FI’s commercial, small business, and retail lines of business, as well as Banking Advisor and other ancillary products, for which we generally charge on a per seat basis or based upon the asset size of the customer. As we continue to implement our new pricing model, we expect the number of customers we charge based on asset size will increase considerably.
•
Through our U.S. mortgage business, a digital homeownership solution uniting people, systems, and stages of the mortgage process into a seamless end-to-end journey for which we generally charge on a per seat basis or anticipated lending volume basis. 
•
Maintenance and support services as well as internal-use or “sandbox” development licenses, for which we generally charge as a percentage of the related subscription fees.
Our subscription revenues are generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract beginning upon activation. For new customers, we may activate a portion of seats at inception of the agreement, with the balance activated at contractually specified points in time thereafter, to pattern our invoicing after the customer’s expected rate of implementation and adoption. Where seats are activated in stages, we charge subscription fees from the date of activation through the anniversary of the initial activation date, and annually thereafter. Subscription fees are generally billed annually in advance while subscription fees for U.S. mortgage are generally billed monthly in advance. Maintenance and support fees, as well as development licenses, are provided over the same periods as the related subscriptions, so fees are invoiced and revenues are recognized over the same periods. Subscription fees invoiced are recorded as deferred revenue pending recognition as revenues. In certain cases, we are authorized to resell access to Salesforce’s CRM solution along with the nCino Platform. When we resell such access, we charge a higher subscription price and remit a higher subscription fee to Salesforce for these subscriptions.
Professional Services and Other Revenues
. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees for implementation and configuration assistance, training, and advisory services. For enterprise and larger regional FIs, we generally work with SI partners to provide the majority of implementation services for the nCino Platform, for which these SI partners bill our customers directly. We have historically delivered professional services ourselves for community banks and smaller credit unions and our U.S. mortgage business has historically provided professional services directly to its customers. Revenues for implementation, training, and advisory services are generally recognized on a proportional performance basis, 
38
Table of Contents
based on labor hours incurred relative to total budgeted hours. To date, our losses on professional services contracts have not been material. During the initial go-live period for a customer on the nCino Platform, professional services revenues generally make up a substantial portion of our revenues from that customer, whereas over time, revenues from established customers are more heavily weighted to subscriptions. While professional services revenues will fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in the future and tend to be higher in periods of faster growth, over time we expect to see subscription revenues make up an increasing proportion of our total revenues.
Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin
Cost of Subscription Revenues
. Cost of subscription revenues consists of fees paid to Salesforce for access to the Salesforce Platform, including Salesforce’s hosting infrastructure and data center operations, along with certain integration fees paid to other third parties. When we resell access to Salesforce’s CRM solution, cost of subscription revenues also includes the subscription fees we remit to Salesforce for providing such access. We also incur costs associated with access to other platforms. In addition, cost of subscription revenues includes personnel-related costs associated with delivering maintenance and support services, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, travel and related costs, amortization of acquired developed technology, and allocated overhead. Our subscription gross margin will vary from period to period as a function of the utilization of support personnel and the extent to which we recognize subscription revenues from the resale of Salesforce’s CRM solution.
Cost of Professional Services and Other Revenues
. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs associated with delivery of these services, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, travel and related costs, and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenues than for our subscription services due to direct labor costs. The cost of professional services revenues has increased in absolute dollars as we have added new customer subscriptions that require professional services and built-out our international professional services capabilities. Realized effective billing and utilization rates drive fluctuations in our professional services and other gross margin on a period-to-period basis.
Operating Expenses
Sales and Marketing.
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees, including salaries, sales commissions and incentives, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, travel and related costs. We capitalize incremental costs incurred to obtain contracts, primarily consisting of sales commissions, and subsequently amortize these costs over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be approximately four years. Sales and marketing expenses also include outside consulting fees, marketing programs, including lead generation, costs of our annual user conference, advertising, trade shows, other event expenses, amortization of intangible assets, and allocated overhead. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as a percentage of revenues.
Research and Development.
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our engineering, product and quality assurance personnel, as well as allocated overhead. Research and development expenses also include the cost of third-party contractors. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We expect research and development costs will decrease as a percentage of revenues as we leverage the investments we have made to date.
General and Administrative.
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, information technology, compliance and other administrative personnel. General and administrative expenses also include accounting, auditing and legal professional services fees, travel and other corporate-related expenses, and allocated overhead, as well as acquisition-related expenses, such as legal and other professional services fees. We expect general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues as we leverage the investments we have made to date.
Non-Operating Income (Expense)
Interest Income. 
Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents.
Interest Expense. 
Interest expense consists primarily of interest related to our financing obligations along with interest expense on borrowings, commitment fees, and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our secured revolving credit facility.
39
Table of Contents
Other Expense, Net. 
Other expense, net consists primarily of foreign currency gains and losses, the majority of which is due to intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional currency of the applicable entity.
Income Tax Provision (Benefit). 
Income tax provision (benefit) consists of federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions.

Subscription Revenues
Subscription revenues increased $59.7 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, due to initial revenues from customers who did not contribute to subscription revenues during the prior period, growth from existing customers within and across lines of business, and acquisitions. Of the increase, 70.6% was attributable to increased revenues from existing customers as additional seats were activated in accordance with contractual terms and customers expanded their adoption of our solutions, and 29.4% was attributable to initial revenues from customers who did not contribute to subscription revenues during the prior period. Subscription revenues were 86.8% of total revenues for fiscal 2025 compared to 85.9% of total revenues for fiscal 2024, primarily due to growth in our installed base.
Professional Services and Other Revenues
Professional services and other revenues increased $4.4 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to the addition of new customers as well as expanded adoption by existing customers within and across lines of business where implementation, configuration, and training services were required.

Cost of Subscription Revenues
Cost of subscription revenues increased $14.1 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, generating a gross margin for subscription revenues of 71.2% compared to a gross margin of 70.5% for fiscal 2024. Other costs of subscription revenues increased $6.3 million due to other data costs. Personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, increased $4.0 million, mainly from an increase in overall headcount. Costs related to Salesforce user fees increased $2.3 million as we continued to add new customers and sell additional functionality to existing customers. The increase in cost of subscription revenues also included an increase of $1.5 million in amortization expense related to acquired intangibles. We expect the cost of subscription revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars as the number of users of the nCino Platform grows.
Cost of Professional Services and Other Revenues
Cost of professional services and other revenues increased $10.3 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, generating a gross margin for professional services and other revenues of (13.2)% compared to a gross margin of (5.3)% for fiscal 2024. For fiscal 2025, personnel costs increased $9.0 million for professional services and other revenues compared to the prior year period, mainly from an increase in headcount and a $2.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. The increase in cost of professional services and other revenue also included an increase of $1.2 million in third-party costs of

professional services. The decrease in our professional services and other gross margin for fiscal 2025 was primarily due to a decline in realized effective billing rates in our professional services teams.

Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses decreased $7.3 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, primarily attributable to a decrease of $11.9 million due to no longer amortizing the SimpleNexus trade name intangible asset as a result of the rebranding of the SimpleNexus solution to nCino Mortgage during fiscal 2024, partially offset by an increase of $2.8 million in amortization expense for fiscal 2025 acquired intangible assets. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses also included a decrease of $0.5 million sales-related travel costs. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was partially offset by an increase $1.2 million in personnel costs primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was also partially offset by an increase of $1.1 million in marketing costs.
Our sales and marketing headcount increased by 54 from January 31, 2024 to January 31, 2025, primarily due to acquisitions. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as a percentage of revenues.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased $12.1 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, primarily attributable to a $9.2 million increase in personnel cost, mainly from an increase in headcount due to acquisitions and an increase in stock-based compensation expense. The increase in research and development expenses also included an increase of $2.1 million in third-party professional fees as a result of increased contract research and development spend, and an increase of $0.5 million in allocated overhead costs due to growth supporting our continued business expansion.
Our research and development headcount increased by 22 from January 31, 2024 to January 31, 2025, primarily due to acquisitions. We expect research and development expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues as we leverage the investments we have made to date.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses increased $13.5 million for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, primarily due to an increase of $9.8 million in personnel costs, mostly attributable to a $6.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, and an increase in headcount. The increase in general and administrative expenses also included an increase of $5.2 million in third-party professional fees, mostly attributable to an increase for acquisition-related expenses for fiscal 2025 acquisitions offset by a decrease in litigation expenses and other professional fees. The increase in general and administrative spend was partially offset by a decrease of $1.6 million in allocated overheard and other general and administrative costs.
Our general and administrative headcount increased by 18 from January 31, 2024 to January 31, 2025, primarily due to acquisitions. We expect general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenues as we leverage the investments we have made to date.

Income tax benefit was $2.5 million for fiscal 2025 compared to a provision of $1.6 million for fiscal 2024 and resulted in an effective tax rate of 7.1% compared to (3.8)% in the prior fiscal year. 
See Note 11 "Income Taxes" of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details on the components of income tax and a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.
We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in several jurisdictions, including the U.S. It is determined by management when a valuation allowance should be recorded, utilizing significant judgement and the use of estimates. In fiscal year 2025, the Company acquired DocFox and recorded a net U.S. deferred tax liability mostly related to identifiable intangible assets. The deferred tax liability recognized provides additional positive evidence that a portion of the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets are realizable. As a result, the Company reduced the historical valuation allowance in the U.S. by $3.6 million.
Comparison of the Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2023 and 2024
For a discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on March 26, 2024.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), we provide an additional financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP ("non-GAAP"). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure helps us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-GAAP financial measure.
Accordingly, we believe that this financial measure reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, and enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects. Although the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may vary from company to company, our detailed presentation may facilitate analysis and comparison of our operating results by management and investors with other peer 
44
Table of Contents
companies, many of which use a similar non-GAAP financial measure to supplement their GAAP results in their public disclosures. This non-GAAP financial measure is non-GAAP operating income (loss), as discussed below.
Non-GAAP operating income (loss).
 Non-GAAP operating income (loss) is defined as loss from operations as reported in our consolidated statements of operations excluding the following items: 
Amortization of Purchased Intangibles.
 nCino incurs amortization expense for purchased intangible assets in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions. Because these costs have already been incurred, cannot be recovered, are non-cash, and are affected by the inherent subjective nature of purchase price allocations, nCino excludes these expenses for our internal management reporting processes. nCino’s management also finds it useful to exclude these charges when assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Although nCino excludes amortization expense for purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense.
 nCino excludes stock-based compensation expenses primarily because they are non-cash expenses that nCino excludes from our internal management reporting processes. nCino’s management also finds it useful to exclude these expenses when they assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use, nCino believes excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies.
Acquisition Related Expenses.

nCino excludes expenses related to acquisitions as they limit comparability of operating results with prior periods.  Acquisition-related expenses, include but are not limited to, costs incurred from third-party professional services firms in connection with business combination and one-time integration activities.  We believe these costs are non-recurring in nature and outside the ordinary course of business.

Litigation Expenses
. nCino excludes fees and expenses related to certain litigation expenses incurred from legal matters outside the ordinary course of our business as we believe their exclusion from non-GAAP operating expenses will facilitate a more meaningful explanation of operating results and comparisons with prior period results.
Restructuring Costs.

nCino excludes costs incurred related to bespoke restructuring plans and other one-time costs that are fundamentally different in strategic nature and frequency from ongoing initiatives. We believe excluding these costs facilitates a more consistent comparison of operating performance over time.
 See Note 18 "Restructuring" of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the charges related to the restructuring.
This non-GAAP financial measure does not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations in the use of non-GAAP measures because they do not include all of the expenses that must be included under GAAP and because they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-GAAP financial measure. In addition, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2025, we had $120.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, and an accumulated deficit of $385.3 million. Our net losses have been driven by our investments in developing the nCino Platform and scaling our sales and marketing organization and finance and administrative functions to support our rapid growth. 
To date, we have funded our capital needs through issuances of common stock including our initial public offering in July 2020, operating cash flows, and our revolving line of credit. We generally bill and collect from our customers annually in advance. Our billings are subject to seasonality, with billings in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year substantially higher than in the second and third quarters. Because we recognize revenues ratably, our deferred revenue balance mirrors the seasonality of our billings.
As of January 31, 2025, the Company had $166.0 million outstanding, no letters of credit issued under the 2024 Credit Facility, was in compliance with all covenants and had borrowing availability of $84.0 million. On March 17, 2024, the Company entered into the Second Amendment for the 2022 Credit Facility which, among other things, increased our borrowing availability to $100.0 million. In March 2024, we borrowed $75.0 million under the 2022 Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of DocFox. On October 28, 2024, the Company entered into the 2024 Credit Facility, which increased our borrowing availability to $250.0 million. The Company borrowed $166.0 million under the 2024 Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of FullCircl and pay the outstanding amount under the 2022 Credit Facility. The Company expects to pay an additional $15.0 million in two years for the FullCircl acquisition upon the satisfaction and performance of certain warranties and covenants. During fiscal 2025, we repaid $75.0 million on the 2022 and 2024 Credit Facilities. As of January 31, 2025, the applicable interest rate was 6.31%. See Note 14 "Revolving Credit Facility" of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. In February 2025, the Company borrowed an additional $52.5 million on the 2024 Credit Facility to fund an acquisition and in March 2025 the Company repaid $50.0 million on the 2024 Credit Facility, see Note 20 "Subsequent Events" for additional information.
We believe that current cash and cash equivalents as well as borrowings available under the 2024 Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development efforts to enhance the nCino Platform and introduce new solutions, market acceptance of our solutions, the continued expansion of our sales and marketing activities, capital expenditure requirements, and any potential future acquisitions. We expect capital expenditures will be appreciably higher in absolute dollars in fiscal 2026 for planned office build-outs, mainly for an international office, compared to prior fiscal years to accommodate our growth, which we estimate to be approximately $8.4 million. We may from time-to-time seek to raise additional capital to support our growth. Any equity financing we may undertake could be dilutive to our existing stockholders, and any debt financing we may undertake could 
46
Table of Contents
require debt service and financial and operational covenants that could adversely affect our business. There is no assurance we would be able to obtain future financing on acceptable terms or at all.
nCino K.K.
In fiscal 2020, we established nCino K.K., a Japanese company in which we own a controlling interest, for purposes of facilitating our entry into the Japanese market. We have consolidated the results of operations and financial condition of nCino K.K. since its inception. Pursuant to an agreement with the holders of the non-controlling interest in nCino K.K., beginning in 2027 we may redeem the non-controlling interest, or be required to redeem such interest by the holders thereof, based on a prescribed formula derived from the relative revenues of nCino K.K. and the Company. The balance of the redeemable non-controlling interest is reported on our balance sheet below total liabilities but above stockholders’ equity at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the redeemable non-controlling interest’s share of earnings or losses and other comprehensive income or loss, or its estimated redemption value. As of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2025, the redeemable non-controlling interest was $3.4 million and $8.3 million, respectively.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
The $55.2 million of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2025 reflects our net loss of $33.0 million and $38.5 million used in changes in working capital accounts, offset by $126.7 million in non-cash charges. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, amortization of costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, foreign currency losses related to intercompany loans and transactions, deferred income taxes, and non-cash operating lease costs. Cash used in working capital accounts was principally a function of a $31.4 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of billings and collections from customers, an increase of $21.5 million of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts, which consisted primarily of sales commissions, a $7.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, a decrease of $3.8 million in operating lease liabilities, and a $0.2 million decrease in accounts payable. The cash used in working capital accounts was partially offset by a $13.8 million increase in deferred revenue, as we expanded our customer base and renewed existing customers, a $10.2 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to acquisition costs and compensation, and a $1.4 million increase in other long-term liabilities.
The $57.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2024 reflects our net loss of $43.5 million and $16.4 million used in changes in working capital accounts, partially offset by $117.2 million in non-cash charges.  Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, amortization of costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, non-cash operating lease costs, deferred income taxes, provision for bad debt, foreign currency losses related to intercompany loans and transactions, and an unrealized gain on investment. Cash used in working capital accounts was principally a function of a $14.3 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of billings and collections from customers, an increase of $10.3 million of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts, which consisted primarily of sales commissions, a $6.0 million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities which includes payments of approximately $5.0 million for severance and other employee costs associated with the restructuring plan and changing commission payment plans from a quarterly basis to a monthly basis, and a decrease of $4.1 million in operating lease liabilities. The cash used in working capital accounts was partially offset by a $15.9 million increase in deferred revenue, as we expanded our customer base and renewed existing customers, a $1.9 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a $0.5 million increase in accounts payable.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
The $219.2 million of net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2025 was comprised of $216.9 million used for the acquisition of DocFox, ILT, and FullCircl, $1.8 million for the purchase of property and equipment and leasehold 
47
Table of Contents
improvements to support the expansion of our business, and $0.5 million for the acquisition of certain technology. The $6.3 million of net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2024 was comprised of $3.5 million used for the purchase of property and equipment to support the expansion of our business, $2.5 million used for the purchase of preferred stock in Rich Data Co, and $0.4 million for an asset acquisition completed in August 2022.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
The $170.5 million of net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2025 was comprised principally of $241.0 million proceeds from borrowings on the 2022 and 2024 Credit Facility to fund the acquisitions of DocFox and FullCircl, $4.5 million of proceeds from stock issuances under the employee stock purchase plan, and $2.8 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by payments of $75.0 million on the 2022 Credit Facility, payments of debt issuance costs of $1.5 million, and principal payments of $1.3 million on financing obligations. The $21.1 million of net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2024 was comprised principally of payments of $30.0 million on the Credit Facility and principal payments of $1.2 million on the financing obligations. The cash used in financing activities was partially offset by $4.7 million in proceeds from stock issuances under the employee stock purchase plan, $4.5 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, and $1.0 million in proceeds from the non-controlling interest in our Japan joint venture. 
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Our estimated future obligations principally consist of an indemnity holdback associated with a business combination, leases related to our facilities, purchase obligations related primarily to licenses and hosting services, financing obligations for leases for which we are considered the owners for accounting purposes, and the Credit Facility. See Note 6 "Business Combinations," Note 13 "Leases," Note 14 "Revolving Credit Facility," and Note 15 "Commitments and Contingencies" of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be significant.
We believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. See Note 1 "Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies" of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a description of our other significant accounting policies. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements and accompanying notes. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenues from subscriptions and professional services. We recognize revenues when a contract exists between the Company and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised products or services to such customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of subscriptions and professional services, which may be capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as subscriptions, services and support, accounted for as a single performance obligation. Revenues are recognized net of allowances and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:
•
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
48
Table of Contents
•
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•
Determination of the transaction price;
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•
Recognition of revenues when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Subscription Revenues
Subscription revenues primarily consist of fees for providing customers access to our solutions, with routine customer support and maintenance related to email and phone support, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates and upgrades released when and if available during the maintenance term. Revenues are generally recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer, which we believe best reflects the manner in which our customers utilize our subscription offerings. Arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the cloud-based application service at any time and, as a result, are accounted for as a service contract. Generally, our subscription contracts are three to five years in length, billed annually in advance, are non-cancelable, and do not contain refund-type provisions. U.S. mortgage contracts are generally billed monthly in advance. Subscription arrangements that are cancelable generally have penalty clauses.
Professional Services and Other Revenues
Professional services and other revenues primarily consist of fees for deployment, configuration, and optimization services, as well as training. The majority of our professional services contracts revenues are recognized over time based on a proportional performance methodology which utilizes input methods. Professional services contracts are billed on a time and materials or fixed fee basis.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
Most of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. We determine SSP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical sales, and contract prices. As our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.
Given the variability of pricing, we use a range of SSP. We determine the SSP range using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of products and services by customer size.
Remaining performance obligations ("RPOs") represent contracted revenues that have not yet been recognized, including deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that we expect will be recognized as revenues in future periods. Our reported RPO balance is influenced by several factors, including the timing of renewals, average contract terms, and foreign currency exchange rates. Because we often enter into large, multi-year contracts and the timing of renewal of these contracts varies by customer, our reported RPOs may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and we do not believe this measure is a useful gauge of our future performance. For these reasons, we do not use RPOs as a tool for managing our business.
Business Combinations
We use our best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. We determine the fair value of intangible assets acquired in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates, particularly with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to:
•
future expected cash flows from subscriptions contracts and acquired developed technologies;
•
historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;
•
royalty rates applied to acquired developed technology platforms and other intangible assets;
49
Table of Contents
•
assumptions about the period of time and intended use of acquired intangible assets;
•
discount rates; and
•
uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances
While we use our best estimates and assumptions, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets have different lives.
Income Taxes
Accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either prepaid expenses and other current assets or accrued expenses and other current liabilities, as appropriate, in our consolidated balance sheets and reflect our estimate of income taxes to be paid or received.
Deferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or refunded and are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. We recognize deferred tax assets for temporary deductible differences and deferred tax liabilities for temporary taxable differences. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for any tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. 
A valuation allowance is provided against a deferred tax asset when we determine that it is more likely than not that all, or a portion of, the balance will not be realized. This requires management to utilize significant judgement and the use of estimates. Any realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is based upon the evaluation of four sources of taxable income, the future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years, and tax-planning strategies. At January 31, 2025, we determined that it is more likely than not that the majority of our deferred tax assets will not be realized and as such, recorded a valuation allowance of $160.3 million against our deferred tax assets of $218.0 million as of that date.
The Company is subject to income tax in the U.S., multiple state and local jurisdictions and various foreign countries. The tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be interpreted differently in certain situations, which could result in differing financial results. The Company is required to exercise judgement regarding the application of these tax laws and regulations. Through this judgement process, the Company will evaluate and recognize any tax liabilities related to any income tax uncertainties. Due to the complexity of any uncertainty, the ultimate resolution may result in a remittance that is different from the current estimate of any tax liabilities.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 "Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies" of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, if applicable.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Interest Rate Risk
At January 31, 2025, we had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $121.3 million, which consisted primarily of bank deposits and money market funds. Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. However, our historical interest income has not fluctuated significantly. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have had a 
50
Table of Contents
material impact on our financial results included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure.
Our 2024 Credit Facility is a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $250.0 million. Borrowings bear interest, at the Borrower’s option, at: (i) a base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the Agent’s “prime rate”, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and (c) the Term SOFR rate plus 1.00% (provided that the base rate shall not be less than 0.00%), plus a margin of 1.00%; or (ii) the Term SOFR rate (provided that the Term SOFR shall not be less than 0.00%), plus a margin of 2.00%, in each case with such margin subject to step ups based on certain leverage ratios. As a result, we are exposed to increased interest rate risk as we make draws. At January 31, 2025, we had $166.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our financial results included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 14 "Revolving Credit Facility" of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and the functional currency of each of our subsidiaries is its local currency. The assets and liabilities of each of our subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the relevant period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates. Decreases in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies may negatively affect revenues and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accounted for as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity. Gains or losses due to transactions in foreign currencies are included in non-operating income (expense), other in our consolidated statements of operations. Furthermore, our customers outside of the U.S. typically pay us in local currency. We have not engaged in hedging of foreign currency transactions to date, although we may choose to do so in the future. We do not believe that an immediate 10% increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies would have a material effect on operating results or financial condition.
At January 31, 2025, based on the balances of our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash denominated in foreign currencies, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates would have had an impact of approximately $7.5 million on our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at January 31, 2025.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of nCino, Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2024 and 2025, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, and the related notes
 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”)
. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2024 and 2025, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated April 1, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates

Revenue Recognition
Description of the Matter
As discussed in Note 1, the Company derives revenues primarily from subscription services and professional services. Revenues are recognized when a contract exists between the Company and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company assesses terms and conditions associated with contracts that can include various combinations of subscription and professional services, which may be capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as subscription services and support, accounted for as a single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis.
The audit effort in evaluating the Company’s accounting for revenue recognition was extensive and required auditor judgment for certain customer contracts to evaluate the terms and conditions, identify distinct performance obligations and support the allocation of transaction price.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s revenue recognition process, including controls designed to mitigate the risk of override of controls. This included testing controls over management’s review of customer contracts and review of manual revenue journal entries.
To test the Company’s accounting for revenue recognition, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, selecting a sample of revenue transactions to test for occurrence and to evaluate contract terms and conditions for accounting in accordance with ASC 606. This testing included reperforming the Company’s assessment of the distinct performance obligations within the arrangement, determination of the allocation of transaction price to the respective performance obligations, as well as testing the application of the revenue recognition requirements including reperforming the calculations of revenue recognized and testing the underlying data used in the calculations. We also assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of nCino, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited nCino, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, nCino, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025, based on the COSO criteria. 
As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of DocFox, Inc. acquired on March 20, 2024, Integrated Lending Technologies, LLC acquired on April 1, 2024 and Artesian Solutions Limited (“FullCircl”) on  November 5, 2024 (together the “acquired entities”), which are included in the fiscal 2025 consolidated financial statements of the Company and on a combined basis accounted for approximately 0.7% and 0.1% of total and net assets, respectively, as of January 31, 2025 and 1.9% and 2.5% of revenues and net loss, respectively for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of acquired entities.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2024 and 2025, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated April 1, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
55
Table of Contents
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts and unless otherwise indicated)
Note 1. 
Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business:
 nCino, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively the Company, is a software-as-a-service ("SaaS") company that provides software solutions to financial institutions to streamline employee and client interactions. The Company is headquartered in Wilmington, North Carolina and has various locations in the United States, North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and South Africa. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “nCino,” and the “Company” refer to nCino, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Fiscal Year End:
 The Company’s fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal year 2025, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation:
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"). The consolidated financial statements include accounts of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries as well as a variable interest entity in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates:
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions made by the Company’s management are used for, but not limited to, revenue recognition including determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, variable consideration, and stand-alone selling price; the average period of benefit associated with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts; fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations; the useful lives of intangible assets; income taxes and the related valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; redemption value of redeemable non-controlling interest;  and stock-based compensation. The Company assesses these estimates on a regular basis using historical experience and other factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Segments: 
The Company operates as 
one
 operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), which is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, in deciding how to make operating decisions, allocate resources, and assess performance. The Company’s CODM allocates resources and assesses performance at the consolidated level.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers:
 The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents exceeded federally insured limits at January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2025. The Company maintains its cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash with high-credit-quality financial institutions.
As of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2025, no individual customer represented more than 10% of accounts receivable. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2024, and 2025, no individual customer represented more than 10% of the Company’s total revenues.
Revenue Recognition: 
The Company derives revenues primarily from subscription services and professional services. Revenues are recognized when a contract exists between the Company and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of subscription and professional services, which may be capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as subscription services and support, accounted for as a single performance obligation. Revenues are recognized net of allowances and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
63
Table of Contents
nCino, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts and unless otherwise indicated)
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
•
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; 
•
Determination of the transaction price;
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•
Recognition of revenues when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
Subscription Revenues
Subscription revenues primarily consist of fees for providing customers access to the Company’s solutions, with routine customer support and maintenance related to email and phone support, bug fixes, and unspecified software updates, and upgrades released when and if available during the maintenance term. Revenues are generally recognized on a ratable basis over the contract term beginning on the date that the Company’s service is made available to the customer, which the Company believes best reflects the manner in which the Company’s customers utilize the Company’s subscription offerings. Arrangements with customers do not provide the customer with the right to take possession of the software supporting the Company's solutions at any time and, as a result, are accounted for as a service contract. Generally, the Company’s subscription contracts are three to five years in length, billed annually in advance, are non-cancelable, and do not contain refund-type provisions. U.S. mortgage contracts are generally billed monthly in advance. Subscription arrangements that are cancelable generally have penalty clauses.
Professional Services and Other Revenues
Professional services revenues primarily consist of fees for deployment, configuration, and optimization services, as well as training. The majority of the Company’s professional services contract revenues are recognized over time based on a proportional performance methodology which utilizes input methods. The Company’s professional services contracts are billed on a time and materials or fixed fee basis.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
Most of the Company’s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis. The Company determines SSP by considering its overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include the Company’s discounting practices, the size and volume of the Company’s transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, the Company’s go-to-market strategy, historical sales, and contract prices. As the Company’s go-to-market strategies evolve, the Company may modify its pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to SSP.
Given the variability of pricing, the Company uses a range of SSP. The Company determines the SSP range using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs. The Company typically has more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of products and services by customer size.
Costs Capitalized to Obtain Revenue Contracts
The Company capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining a non-cancelable subscription and support revenue contract if the Company expects the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. The capitalized amounts are subsequently amortized over the estimated life of the contract. Capitalized amounts consist primarily of sales commissions paid to the Company’s direct sales force. Capitalized amounts also include (1) amounts paid to employees other than the direct sales force who earn incentive payouts under annual compensation plans that are tied to the value of contracts acquired and (2) the associated payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs associated with the payments to these employees. Capitalized costs related to 
64
Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts and unless otherwise indicated)
new revenue contracts or on upsell of existing contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over 
four
 to 
five years
, which, although longer than the typical initial contract period, reflects the average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. In arriving at this average period of benefit, the Company evaluated both qualitative and quantitative factors which included the estimated life cycles of its offerings and its customer attrition. Commissions paid relating to contract renewals are not commensurate with sales commissions paid on initial contracts and as such are deferred and amortized over the related renewal period. The capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all non-cancelable customer contracts. The Company periodically evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates, or other events which would indicate that its amortization period should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment. Any changes in the anticipated period of benefit or the average renewal term are recognized on a prospective basis upon occurrence. Amortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Judgments
Contracts with customers may include multiple services requiring allocation of the transaction price across the different performance obligations.
Standalone selling price is established by maximizing the amount of observable inputs, primarily actual historical selling prices for performance obligations where available and includes consideration of factors such as go-to-market model and customer size. Where standalone selling price may not be observable (e.g., the performance obligation is not sold separately), the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs by using information that may include reviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers, and selling models.
At times, the Company provides credits or incentives to its customers. Known and estimable credits and incentives represent a form of variable consideration, which are determined at contract inception and reduce the revenues recognized for a particular contract. At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews and updates its estimates as additional information becomes available. The Company believes that there will not be significant changes to its estimates of variable consideration as of January 31, 2025.
The Company evaluates whether it is the principal or agent with respect to vendor reseller agreements pursuant to which the Company resells certain third-party solutions along with the Company’s solutions. Where the Company is the principal, it first obtains control of the inputs to the specific good or service and directs their use to create the combined output. The Company’s control is evidenced by its involvement in the integration of the good or service on its platform before it is transferred to its customers and is further supported by the Company being primarily responsible to its customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing. The Company has determined that, generally, the Company is acting as the principal and reports revenues from these types of contracts on a gross basis, meaning the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenues and expenses incurred are recorded as cost of revenues.

Deferred Revenue:
 Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and deposits. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue recognition criteria has been met. Customers are typically invoiced for these agreements in advance of regular annual installments and revenues are recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing, size, and new business linearity. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period are recorded as deferred revenue, current portion, and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred revenue, net of current portion on the consolidated balance sheets.
Payment terms vary by contract, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 
30
 to 
45
 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company has determined contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenues recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to provide financing to customers. Any implied financing costs are considered insignificant in the context of the Company’s contracts.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at fair value.
Restricted Cash:
 Restricted cash primarily consisted of a minimum cash balance the Company maintained with a lender under the Company's revolving credit facility for fiscal year 2024. Restricted cash consists of deposits held as collateral for the Company's bank guarantees issued in place of security deposits for certain property leases and credit cards, at January 31, 2025. Restricted cash is included in long-term prepaid expenses and other assets at January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2025 on the consolidated balance sheets.
Accounts Receivable and Allowances:
 A receivable is recorded when an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment exists, such that only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due. Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Certain performance obligations may require payment before delivery of the service to the customer. The Company recognizes a contract asset in the form of accounts receivable when the Company has an unconditional right to payment, and the Company records a contract asset in the form of unbilled accounts receivable when revenues earned on a contract exceeds the billings. The Company’s standard billing terms are annual in advance, while U.S. mortgage standard billing terms are monthly in advance. An unbilled accounts receivable is a contract asset related to the delivery of the Company’s subscription services and professional services for which the related billings will occur in a future period. Unbilled accounts receivable consists of (i) revenues recognized for professional services performed but not yet billed and (ii) revenues recognized from non-cancelable, multi-year orders in which fees increase annually but for which the Company is not contractually able to invoice until a future period. Accounts receivable are reported at their gross outstanding balance reduced by an allowance for estimated receivable losses, which includes allowances for doubtful accounts and a reserve for expected credit losses.
The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based upon the credit worthiness of customers, historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable, current market and economic conditions, and supportable forecasts about the future. Relevant risk characteristics include customer size and historical loss patterns. This estimate is analyzed quarterly and adjusted as necessary. The Company records the allowance against bad debt expense through the consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative expenses, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Any incremental allowance is recorded as an offset to deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success.
A summary of activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for expected credit losses is as follows:

Leases: 
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception date based on whether there is an identified asset and whether the Company controls the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. The Company determines the classification of the lease, whether operating or financing, at the lease commencement date, which is the date the leased assets are made available for use. The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its facilities and equipment leases. The Company did not have any finance leases as of January 31, 2024 or January 31, 2025.
Operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease term reflects the non-cancelable period of the lease together with options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise such option. Variable costs, such as common area maintenance costs, are not included in the measurement of the ROU assets and lease liabilities, but 
66
Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts and unless otherwise indicated)
are expensed as incurred. If an implicit rate is not readily determined by the Company's leases, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of the lease payments. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Lease expense for such leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Property and Equipment:
 Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and commences once the asset is placed in service or is ready for its intended use. 
The estimated useful lives by asset classification are generally as follows:
Asset Classification
Estimated Useful Life
Furniture and fixtures
3
-
7
 years
Computers and equipment
3
 years
Buildings
40
 years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of remaining life of the lease term or estimated useful life
Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such retirement is reflected in operating expenses.
Financing Obligations:
 The Company records assets and liabilities for lease arrangements where the Company has continued involvement due to purchase options and is deemed to be the owner for accounting purposes.

Intangible Assets:
 Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Each period, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.

Impairment Assessment: 
The Company evaluates intangible assets and long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This includes but is not limited to significant adverse changes in business climate, market conditions, or other events that indicate an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of these assets or asset group, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.
 There were no material impairments of intangible assets or long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2024, and 2025.
Goodwill:
 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather the carrying amounts of these assets are assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on November 1, the first day of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred between annual impairment tests.

The Company has 
one
 reporting unit, therefore the Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the entity level. To perform its impairment testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, company-specific events, changes in circumstances, and our share price. If the qualitative factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit, then we do not consider the assigned goodwill to be impaired. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative assessment is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative assessment. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
 There is 
no
 goodwill impairment for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2024, and 2025.

(In thousands, except share and per share amounts and unless otherwise indicated)
Variable Interest Entity:
 The Company holds an interest in a Japanese company (“nCino K.K.”) that is considered a variable interest entity ("VIE"). nCino K.K. is considered a VIE as it has insufficient equity capital to finance its activities without additional financial support. The Company is the primary beneficiary of nCino K.K. as it has the power over the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of nCino K.K. and has the obligation to absorb expected losses and the right to receive expected benefits that could be significant to nCino K.K., in accordance with accounting guidance. As a result, the Company consolidated nCino K.K. and all significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated. The Company will continue to assess whether it has a controlling financial interest and whether it is the primary beneficiary at each reporting period. Other than the Company’s equity investments, the Company has not provided financial or other support to nCino K.K. that it was not contractually obligated to provide. The assets of the VIE can only be used to settle the obligations of the VIE and the creditors of the VIE do not have recourse to the Company. The assets and liabilities of the VIE were not significant to the Company’s consolidated financial statements except for cash which is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 2 "Variable Interest Entity and Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest" for additional information regarding the Company’s variable interest.
Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest:
 Redeemable non-controlling interest relates to minority investors of nCino K.K. An agreement with the minority investors of nCino K.K. contains redemption features whereby the interest held by the minority investors are redeemable either at the option of the (i) minority investors or (ii) the Company, both beginning on the eighth anniversary of the initial capital contribution. If the interest of the minority investors were to be redeemed under this agreement, the Company would be required to redeem the interest based on a prescribed formula derived from the relative revenues of nCino K.K. and the Company. The balance of the redeemable non-controlling interest is reported at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the redeemable non-controlling interest’s share of earnings or losses and other comprehensive income or loss, or its estimated redemption value. The resulting changes in the estimated redemption amount (increases or decreases) are recorded with corresponding adjustments against retained earnings or, in the absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in-capital. These interests are presented on the consolidated balance sheets outside of equity under the caption “Redeemable non-controlling interest.”
Business Combinations:
 Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The Company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and may be subject to refinement due to unanticipated events and circumstances. For intangible assets, the Company typically uses income-based methods of valuation (for example, the multi-period excess earnings method is used to estimate the fair value estimate of customer relationships and the relief from royalty method is used in the fair value estimate of developed technologies). These methods typically start with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in these methods are forecasted revenues, obsolescence life and factor, customer attrition rate, and the discount rate among other assumptions.
Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially recorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. The Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company’s preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.
For acquisitions involving additional consideration to be transferred to the selling parties in the event certain future events occur or conditions are met (“contingent consideration”), the Company recognizes the acquisition-date fair value of contingent consideration as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the business combination. Contingent consideration meeting the criteria to be classified as equity in the consolidated balance sheets is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is recorded within stockholders’ equity. Contingent consideration classified as a liability is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved, with any changes in fair value recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts and unless otherwise indicated)
Investments
: The Company's investments are non-marketable equity investments without readily determinable fair value and for which the Company does not have control or significant influence. The investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairment as permitted by the measurement alternative. The Company assesses at each reporting period if the investments continue to qualify for the measurement alternative. Gains or losses resulting from observable price changes are recognized currently in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. The Company assesses the investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments may not be recoverable.

Debt Issuance Costs: 
Debt issuance costs are initially deferred and amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the debt. The Company uses the straight-line basis as it approximates the amounts calculated under the effective-interest method. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to the secured revolving credit facility are considered long-term and are included in long-term prepaid expenses and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
Cost of Revenues:
 Cost of subscription and support revenues consists of costs related to hosting the Company’s software solutions and employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expenses and allocated overhead associated with customer support. Cost of professional services and other revenues consist of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based compensation expenses, and allocated overhead, and the cost of subcontractors. Allocated overhead includes costs such as information technology infrastructure, rent and occupancy charges, along with employee benefit costs, and taxes based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenues and operating expenses category. In addition, subscription cost of revenues includes amortization of acquired developed technology.
Research and Development
: Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation associated with our engineering, product and quality assurance personnel, as well as allocated overhead. Research and development expenses also include the cost of third-party contractors. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Advertising:
 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and consist of advertising, third-party marketing, branded marketing, and conference and event expenses.
 Advertising expenses are recorded in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and were $
8.7
 million, $
7.7
 million, and $
8.7
 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively.
Income Taxes:
 Deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for any tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment within income tax expense. The Company reflects the expected amount of income taxes to be paid or refunded during the year as current income tax expense or benefit, as applicable.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company follows the accounting standards on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed, or expected to be claimed, on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Under this guidance, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the benefit having a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting interim periods.
When and if applicable, potential interest and penalties are accrued as incurred, within the income tax provision.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss): 
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is reported as a component of stockholders’ equity and includes unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation adjustments.
Foreign Currency:
 The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss recorded in foreign currency translation line item. All assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Equity transactions are translated using historical exchange rates.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses due to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations and were $(
1.4
) million, $(
1.2
) million, and $(
10.5
) million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively, primarily related to various intercompany loans.

Stock-Based Compensation:
 As further described in Note 10 "Stock-Based Compensation," the Company records compensation expense associated with stock options and other equity-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. The Company establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees and recognizes expense on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the applicable vesting period. The estimated forfeiture rate applied is based on historical forfeiture rates.
Basic and Diluted Loss per Common Share:
 Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to nCino, Inc. by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
Diluted loss per share is calculated by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock, which is comprised of stock options issued and outstanding, nonvested RSUs issued and outstanding, and shares issuable pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") when determining the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For purposes of the diluted loss per share calculation, basic and diluted loss per share were the same, as the effect of all potentially dilutive securities would have been anti-dilutive.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements: 
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The guidance includes amendments to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 on a retrospective basis, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.

Variable Interest Entity and Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest
In October 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with Japan Cloud Computing, L.P. and M30 LLC (collectively, the “Investors”) to engage in the investment, organization, management, and operation of nCino K.K. that is

focused on the distribution of the Company’s products in Japan. In October 2019, the Company initially contributed $
4.7
 million in cash in exchange for 
51
% of the outstanding common stock of nCino K.K. In October 2023, the Company made a further investment in nCino K.K. of $
1.0
 million that, including additional investments in nCino K.K. of $
1.0
 million by existing third-party investors in October 2023, maintained the Company's ownership of 
51
%. As of January 31, 2025, the Company controls a majority of the outstanding common stock in nCino K.K.
All of the common stock held by the Investors is callable by the Company or puttable by the Investors at the option of the Investors or at the option of the Company beginning on the eighth anniversary of the agreement with the Investors. Should the call or put option be exercised, the redemption value would be determined based on a prescribed formula derived from the discrete revenues of nCino K.K. and the Company and may be settled, at the Company’s discretion, with Company stock or cash or a combination of the foregoing. As a result of the put right available to the Investors, the redeemable non-controlling interests in nCino K.K. are classified outside of permanent equity in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. 
The following table summarizes the activity in the redeemable non-controlling interests for the period indicated below:

Fair Value Measurements
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
Level 1.
 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2.
 Significant other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level 3.
 Significant unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.
The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value as of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2025 because of the relatively short duration of these instruments.
The carrying amount of any outstanding borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility approximates fair value due to the variable interest rates of the borrowings.

Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations
Significant movements in the deferred revenue balance during the period consisted of increases due to payments received or due in advance prior to the transfer of control of the underlying performance obligations to the customer and $
8.3
 million from acquisitions, which were offset by decreases due to revenues recognized in the period. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, $
170.5
 million of revenues were recognized out of the deferred revenue balance as of January 31, 2024.
Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenues that have not yet been recognized, which includes both deferred revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligation is influenced by several factors, including the timing of renewals, average contract terms, and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company applies practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that are billed and recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint.
Remaining performance obligations were $
1.2
 billion as of January 31, 2025. The Company expects to recognize approximately 
67
% of its remaining performance obligation as revenues in the next 
24
 months, approximately

% more in the following

DocFox, Inc. (“DocFox”)
On March 20, 2024 (the "DocFox Acquisition Date"), the Company acquired the outstanding equity interests of DocFox, which provides a solution to automate onboarding experiences for commercial and business banking. The Company acquired DocFox for its complementary product set, which helps simplify and automate the onboarding and account opening process. The Company has included the financial results of DocFox in the consolidated statements of operations from the DocFox Acquisition Date. Including the $
2.0
 million in post combination expense referenced below, transaction costs associated with the DocFox acquisition were approximately $
3.9
 million and were recorded in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.
The Company paid a total of $
74.3
 million in cash as of the DocFox Acquisition Date. Included in the total cash paid was $
6.2
 million for DocFox common stock options that were cash settled on the DocFox Acquisition Date. The $
6.2
 million fair value of the DocFox common stock options was allocated between consideration transferred and post combination expense in the amounts of $
4.2
 million and $
2.0
 million, respectively. As there was no future service requirement due to accelerated vesting of these options, the entire $
2.0
 million was recorded as transaction cost immediately following the acquisition and not in consideration transferred. The $
2.0
 million is included within general and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. The estimated fair value of the consideration transferred was $
72.4
 million on the DocFox Acquisition Date.
In addition, the Company issued 
198,505
 RSUs with an approximate fair value of $
6.1
 million to certain employees of DocFox, which will vest over 
four years
 subject to such employees' continued employment. The RSUs will be recorded as stock-based compensation expense post-acquisition as the RSUs vest and has been excluded from the purchase consideration.

The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method and, as a result, tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values at the DocFox Acquisition Date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill.

Initial accounting for the acquisition is not complete, and further measurement period adjustments may occur in fiscal year 2026, but no later than one year from the DocFox Acquisition Date. The area of the acquisition that remains preliminary relates to finalizing our estimate of the impact of acquisition accounting on deferred income taxes or liabilities, including uncertain tax positions. As the initial acquisition accounting is based on preliminary assessments, actual values may differ materially when final information becomes available. The Company believes the information gathered to date provides a reasonable basis for estimating the preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company will continue to evaluate these items until they are satisfactorily resolved and make necessary adjustments, within the allowable measurement period.
The following table sets forth the components of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and their estimated useful lives over which the acquired intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis, as this approximates the pattern in which economic benefits of the assets are consumed as of the DocFox Acquisition Date:

Developed technology represents the fair value of DocFox's technology. Customer relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships with DocFox's customers. Trade names represents the fair value of DocFox’s company name. 
Goodwill is primarily attributable to expanded market opportunities, synergies expected from the acquisition, and assembled workforce. The goodwill is not deductible for tax. 
The financial results of DocFox since the DocFox Acquisition Date through January 31, 2025 are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements and are not material to the Company. The Company has not disclosed pro-forma revenue and earnings attributable to DocFox as they did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Artesian Solutions Limited ("FullCircl")
On November 5, 2024 (the "FullCircl Acquisition Date"), the Company acquired the outstanding equity interests of FullCircl, which provides an onboarding and customer lifecycle intelligence platform. The Company acquired FullCircl for its complementary products and believes this will provide greater value for new and existing customers. The Company has included the financial results of FullCircl in the consolidated statements of operations from the FullCircl Acquisition Date. Transaction costs associated with the FullCircl acquisition were approximately $
3.6
 million and were recorded in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.
The purchase consideration was $
142.4
 million, of which the Company paid a total of $
129.2
 million in cash at the FullCircl Acquisition Date. The purchase consideration includes a deferred payment of $
15.0
 million, with a present value of $
13.2
 million at the FullCircl Acquisition Date, relating to an indemnity holdback amount to be paid in 24 months following the FullCircl Acquisition Date which is included in other long-term liabilities at January 31, 2025 on the consolidated balance sheets.
In addition, the Company issued 
52,877
 RSUs with an approximate fair value of $
2.0
 million to certain employees of FullCircl, which will vest over 
four years
 subject to such employees' continued employment. The RSUs will be recorded as stock-based compensation expense post-acquisition as the RSUs vest and has been excluded from the purchase consideration.
The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method and, as a result, tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values at the FullCircl Acquisition Date. Any excess consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill and is subject to revision as the purchase price allocation is complete. The Company determined the acquisition date contract assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 606.
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the FullCircl Acquisition Date:

Due to the timing of the transaction, initial accounting for the acquisition is not complete, and further measurement period adjustments may occur in fiscal year 2026, but no later than one year from the FullCircl Acquisition Date. The Company has estimated the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired based on information currently available and with the assistance of independent third-party valuations and will continue to adjust those estimates as additional information becomes available, valuations are finalized and the tax returns for the pre-acquisition period are completed. The primary areas of the acquisition accounting that remain preliminary relate to, but are not limited to, (i) finalizing the review and valuation of intangible assets (including key assumptions, inputs and estimates), (ii) finalizing the evaluation and valuation of certain legal matters and/or loss contingencies, including those that the Company may not yet be aware of but meet the requirement to qualify as a pre-acquisition contingency, and (iii) finalizing our estimate of the impact of acquisition accounting on deferred income taxes or liabilities, including uncertain tax positions. As the initial acquisition accounting is based on preliminary assessments, actual values may differ materially when final information becomes available. The Company believes the information gathered to date

provides a reasonable basis for estimating the preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company will continue to evaluate these items until they are satisfactorily resolved and make necessary adjustments, within the allowable measurement period.
The following table sets forth the components of the preliminary fair value of identifiable intangible assets and their estimated useful lives over which the acquired intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis, as this approximates the pattern in which economic benefits of the assets are consumed as of the FullCircl Acquisition Date:

Developed technology represents the preliminary fair value of FullCircl's technology. Customer relationships represent the preliminary fair value of the underlying relationships with FullCircl's customers. Trade names represents the preliminary fair value of FullCircl’s company name. The Company continues to assess the rates used in the preliminary valuation methods such as, but not limited to, the discount rates for developed technology, customer relationships and trade name and customer attrition rate for customer relationships.
Goodwill is primarily attributable to expanded market opportunities, synergies expected from the acquisition, and assembled workforce. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax. 
The financial results of FullCircl since the FullCircl Acquisition Date are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements and are not material to the Company. The Company has not disclosed pro-forma revenue and earnings attributable to FullCircl as they did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company rebranded the SimpleNexus solution to nCino Mortgage, resulting in a change to the trade name useful life. As a result, the Company recorded accelerated amortization to fully amortize the remaining trade name intangible asset in fiscal 2024.
The expected future amortization expense for intangible assets as of January 31, 2025 is as follows:

Stock-Based Compensation
Equity Incentive Plans
The Company has 
two
 equity incentive plans: the nCino, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Stock Ownership and Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and the 2019 Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan” and together with the 2014 Plan, the “Incentive Plans”). Under the 2014 Plan, the Board of Directors had allotted 
15,025,666
 shares of common stock for incentive options or non-qualified options as of January 31, 2025. Non-qualified options may be granted to Company employees, non-employee directors, and consultants. The exercise price of options is determined by the Board of Directors, but cannot be less than 
100
% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The options generally vest in one of two ways:
•
In equal annual installments over 
four years
 from the grant date.
•
Upon a change in control transaction (with respect to certain Incentive Plan participants).
All options expire 
ten years
 from the grant date and, with respect to certain Incentive Plan participants, provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control of the Company.
In July 2019, the Company established the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan for the issuance of awards in the form of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, and other stock-based awards.
In connection with the Company's initial public offering ("IPO"), the Company's Board of Directors adopted and the Company's stockholders approved the 2019 Plan which amended and restated the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. All awards shall be granted within 
ten years
 from the effective date of the 2019 Plan and can only be granted to employees, officers, directors, and consultants and generally vest over 
four years
.
 Under the 2019 Plan, the number of available shares was increased to 
15,250,000
, plus an annual increase added on the first day of each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022, and continuing until, and including, 
80
Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts and unless otherwise indicated)
the fiscal year ending January 31, 2031. The annual increase will be equal to the lesser of (i) 
5
% of the number of shares issued and outstanding as of January 31 of the immediately preceding fiscal year and (ii) an amount determined by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company ceased granting awards under the 2014 Plan during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, and all shares that remained available for issuance under the 2014 Plan were transferred to the 2019 Plan prior to the closing of the IPO. Additionally, the number of shares available under the 2019 Plan shall be increased by the number of shares outstanding under the 2014 Plan that expire, terminate or are canceled without having been exercised or settled in full. The 2014 Plan governs outstanding awards granted prior to the adoption of the 2019 Plan. 
RSUs vest upon the satisfaction of a time-based condition. RSUs are generally earned over a service period of 
four years
. For RSUs granted to the non-employee members of the Board of Directors, some vest in less than a year, some annually and some over three years. 
The compensation expense related to these awards is based on the grant date fair value of the RSUs and is recognized on a ratable basis over the applicable service period. 
As of January 31, 2025, the Company had stock options outstanding under the 2014 Plan and the 2019 Plan had stock options and RSUs outstanding.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In July 2020, the Board of Directors adopted and stockholders approved the ESPP, which became effective immediately prior to the closing of the IPO. The ESPP includes two components, one component is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") and a component that does not qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code. The ESPP initially reserved and authorized the issuance of up to a total of 
1,800,000
 shares of common stock to participating employees. The aggregate number of shares of the Company's common stock under the ESPP will automatically increase on the first day of each fiscal year, beginning with the first fiscal year ending January 31, 2022 and continuing until the fiscal year ended January 31, 2031, by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 
1
% of the shares of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding on January 31 of the immediately preceding fiscal year, (ii) 
1,800,000
 shares of the Company's common stock or (iii) an amount determined by the Board of Directors. As of January 31, 2025, 
5,484,024
 shares of common stock remain available for grant under the ESPP.
The ESPP permits employees to purchase the Company's common stock through payroll deductions during 
six month
 offerings. The offering periods begin each January 1 and July 1, or such other period determined by the compensation committee. Eligible employees will purchase the shares at a price per share equal to the lesser of (i) 
85
% of the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock on the first business day of such offering period and (ii) 
85
% of the fair market value of share of the Company's common stock on the last business day of such offering period, although the compensation committee has discretion to change the purchase price with respect to future offering periods, subject to terms of the ESPP.
The first offering period for the ESPP began on July 1, 2021 and ended on December 31, 2021. Thereafter, offering periods will begin on January 1 and July 1.
The fair value of ESPP shares is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model based on assumptions as follows for ESPP awards:
Expected life.
 The expected life reflects the period for which the Company believes the ESPP will remain outstanding. The expected term for the ESPP award approximates the offering period of six months.
Expected volatility.
 The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock.
Expected dividends.
 The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company has not and does not expect to pay dividends. 
Risk-free interest rate.
 The risk-free interest rate reflects the U.S. Treasury yield for a similar expected life instrument in effect at the time of the grant of the ESPP share.

Income taxes payable, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2024 and 2025 were $
2.0
 million and $
1.2
 million, respectively.
The Company continually assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on an evaluative process that considers all available positive and negative evidence. The Company has established a valuation allowance in the amount of $
148.3
 million and $
160.3
 million as of January 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively, because the Company believes it is not more likely than not the deferred tax asset in jurisdictions excluding several foreign jurisdictions will be realized. 
We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in several jurisdictions, including the U.S. It is determined by management when a valuation allowance should be recorded, utilizing significant judgement and the use of estimates. In fiscal year 2025, the Company acquired DocFox and FullCircl. As part of the DocFox acquisition, the Company recorded a net U.S. deferred tax liability mostly related to identifiable intangible assets. The deferred tax liability

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

recognized provides additional positive evidence that a portion of the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets are realizable. As a result, the Company reduced the historical valuation allowance in the U.S. by $
3.6
 million.
For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2024, and 2025, the valuation allowance increased by $
29.3
 million, $
9.9
 million, and $
12.0
 million, respectively.
The Company maintains its assertion of the Company’s intent for certain foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested. As of January 31, 2025, the Company has not recorded taxes on approximately $
26.7
 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company generally does not provide for taxes related to the Company’s undistributed earnings because such earnings either would not be taxable when remitted or they are indefinitely reinvested. If in the foreseeable future, the Company can no longer demonstrate that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested, a tax liability will be recognized, which could include other taxes such as withholding tax. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized tax liability is directly influenced by the Company’s net operating loss and valuation allowance position in the U.S. If the Company were to repatriate the undistributed earnings, the tax liability is $
1.2
 million.
The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as of January 31, 2025 were as follows:

The Company acquired a portion of these carryforwards through mergers and acquisitions. These acquired carryforwards will be subject to limitations which could limit the Company's utilization in future periods.
In 2021, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development introduced its Pillar Two Framework Model Rules ("Pillar 2"). The Company is under the revenue threshold where Pillar 2 would not apply and is not subject to tax under these rules. The Company will continue to monitor and reflect the impact of such legislative changes in future financial statements as appropriate.

 million. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate would be $
3.7
 million for the year ended January 31, 2025. 
The Company's policy for classifying interest and penalties with unrecognized tax benefits is to include such items in income tax expense. The total amount of interest and penalties associated with income tax benefits is $
2.0
 million for the year ended January 31, 2025. The Company anticipates insignificant change to unrecognized tax benefits over the next year.

Revolving Credit Facility
On February 11, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), by and among the Company, nCino OpCo (the “Borrower”), certain subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors, and Bank of America, N.A. as lender (the “Lender”), pursuant to which the Lender is providing to the Borrower a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $
50.0
 million (the “2022 Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit subject to a sublimit of $
7.5
 million. Any issuance of letters of credit will reduce the amount available under the Credit Facility. The Company was also required to maintain at least $
5.0
 million of the Company's cash and/or marketable securities with the Lender which was considered restricted cash and was included in long-term prepaid expenses and other assets as of January 31, 2024.
On February 9, 2024, the Company entered into a First Amendment to extend the existing maturity date of the 2022 Credit Facility provided for under the 2022 Credit Agreement to February 11, 2025.
On March 17, 2024, the Company entered into the Second Amendment which increased our borrowing availability to $
100.0
 million and extended the existing maturity date of the 2022 Credit Facility to March 17, 2029.
Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Facility accrued interest, at the Borrower’s option, at: (i) a base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the Lender’s “prime rate”, (b) the federal funds rate plus 
0.50
%, and (c) the Term SOFR rate plus 
1.00
% (provided that the base rate shall not be less than 
0.00
%), plus a margin of 
1.3125
%; or (ii) the Term SOFR rate (provided that the Term SOFR shall not be less than 
0.00
%), plus a margin of 
2.3125
%, in each case with such margin subject to a step down based on achievement of a certain leverage ratio. The Company was also required to pay an unused commitment fee to the Lender of 
0.30
% of the average daily unutilized commitments (with a step down based on achievement of a certain leverage ratio). The Company was also required to pay customary letter of credit fees.
On October 28, 2024, the Company terminated the 2022 Credit Agreement above and entered into a new Credit Agreement (the "2024 Credit Agreement"), by and among the Company, nCino OpCo, Inc. (the "Borrower"), certain subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors, the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders") and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent (the "Agent"). The 2024 Credit Agreement includes a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $
250.0
 million (the "2024 Credit Facility") with a maturity date of October 28, 2029. The 2024 Credit Facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit subject to a sublimit of $
45.0
 million. Any issuances of letters of credit will reduce the amount available under the 2024 Credit Facility.
Borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility bear interest, at the Borrower’s option, at: (i) a base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the Agent’s “prime rate”, (b) the federal funds rate plus 
0.50
%, and (c) the Term SOFR rate plus 
1.00
% (provided that the base rate shall not be less than 
0.00
%), plus a margin of 
1.00
%; or (ii) the Term SOFR rate (provided that the

Term SOFR shall not be less than 
0.00
%), plus a margin of 
2.00
%, in each case with such margin subject to step ups based on certain leverage ratios. The Company is also required to pay an unused commitment fee to the Lenders of 
0.25
% of the average daily unutilized commitments (with step ups based on certain leverage ratios). The Company must also pay customary letter of credit fees.
The Company may repay amounts borrowed any time without penalty. Borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility may be reborrowed.
The 2024 Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default that are customary for loans of this type. The financial covenants require the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis to maintain (i) a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio not in excess of 
4.00
:1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter, and (ii) a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio not less than 
3.00
:1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2025.
The 2024 Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Company and each of its current and future material domestic subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”) and secured by substantially all of the personal property, subject to customary exceptions, of the Borrower and the Guarantors, in each case, now owned or later acquired, including a pledge of all of the Borrower’s capital stock, the capital stock of all of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries, and 
65
% of the capital stock of foreign subsidiaries that are directly owned by the Borrower or a Guarantor.
As of January 31, 2024 and 2025, unamortized debt issuance costs were $
0.0
 million and $
1.4
 million, respectively, and are included in long-term prepaid expenses and other assets.
The Company had $
0.0
 million and no letters of credit issued under the 2022 Credit Facility as of January 31, 2024. The Company had $
166.0
 million outstanding and no letters of credit issued under the 2024 Credit Facility and was in compliance with all covenants as of January 31, 2025. As of January 31, 2025, the applicable interest rate was 
6.31
%. The available borrowing capacity under the 2024 Credit Facility was $
84.0
 million as of January 31, 2025. In February 2025, the Company borrowed an additional $
52.5
 million on the 2024 Credit Facility to fund an acquisition and in March 2025, the Company repaid $
50.0
 million on the 2024 Credit Facility, see Note 20 "Subsequent Events" for additional information.
Note 15. 
Commitments and Contingencies
In addition to the operating lease commitments described in Note 13 "Leases", the Company has additional contractual commitments as described further below.
Purchase Commitments
The Company’s purchase commitments consist of non-cancellable agreements to purchase goods and services, primarily licenses and hosting services, entered into in the ordinary course of business.
Financing Obligations
The Company entered into a lease agreement for the Company's headquarters in November 2020 in connection with a new lessor acquiring the property. Due to a purchase option contained in that lease, the Company is deemed to have continuing involvement and is considered to be the owner of the Company's headquarters for accounting purposes. As a result, the Company did not meet the criteria to apply sale-leaseback accounting and therefore, recorded an asset and corresponding financing obligation for $
16.3
 million at inception of that lease. The fair value of the leased property and corresponding financing obligation are included in property and equipment, net and financing obligations on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively.
In January 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to its November 2020 headquarters lease to provide for construction of a parking deck, which upon completion was subject to exclusive use by the Company. Due to the Company also being deemed to be the owner of the parking deck for accounting purposes, the costs associated with the construction of the parking deck were capitalized as construction in progress with a corresponding construction liability through construction. Upon completion of the parking deck in September 2021, for approximately $
17.7
 million, the costs of the construction in 
89

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts and unless otherwise indicated)
progress and the corresponding construction liability were reclassified to property and equipment, net and financing obligations on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively.
In April 2021, the Company entered into a new lease agreement for the construction of an additional office building that is on the same parcel of land as the Company's existing headquarters. Due to a purchase option contained in that April 2021 lease, the Company is also deemed to be the owner of the additional building for accounting purposes, the costs associated with the construction of the additional building were capitalized as construction in progress with a corresponding construction liability through construction. Upon completion of the additional building in November 2022, for approximately $
22.4
 million, the costs of the construction in progress and the corresponding construction liability were reclassified to property and equipment, net and financing obligations on the consolidated balance sheets, respectively, and the term of the Company's November 2020 lease for its headquarters and the related parking deck became coterminous with the April 2021 lease. The term of the April 2021 lease expires in October 2037 with options to extend. The purchase option expires if not exercised on or before November 30, 2026.
The leases will be analyzed for applicable lease accounting upon expiration of the purchase option, if not exercised.
Purchase commitments and future minimum lease payments required under financing obligations as of January 31, 2025 is as follows:

%.
Indemnification
In the ordinary course of business, the Company generally includes standard indemnification provisions in its arrangements with third parties, including vendors, customers, and the Company’s directors and officers. Pursuant to these provisions, the Company may be obligated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the Company’s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. The Company has not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings or is subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of business including the following:
On September 26, 2022, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery in connection with the series of mergers in which the Company became the parent of nCino OpCo and SimpleNexus. On December 28, 2023, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted in full defendants' motions to dismiss the complaint. On

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

January 25, 2024, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. On September 12, 2024, the Delaware Supreme Court summarily affirmed the dismissal of the complaint in its entirety.
Other Commitments and Contingencies
The Company may be subject to audits related to its non-income taxes by tax authorities in jurisdictions where it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts. The Company accrues for any assessments if deemed probable and estimable.
Note 16. 
Related-Party Transactions
On November 1, 2022, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, nCino OpCo, acquired preferred shares of ZestFinance, Inc. (d/b/a ZEST AI) ("Zest AI"), a private company, for $
2.5
 million and is included in investments as of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2025 on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The investment was considered a related party transaction as entities affiliated with Insight Partners, a beneficial owner of the Company, owned greater than 
ten
 percent of Zest AI. 
In March 2025, we recorded a realized gain of $
1.2
 million from the sale of all our shares in Zest AI.

Note 17. 
Basic and Diluted Loss per Share
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to nCino, Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the fiscal period. Diluted loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including stock options issued and outstanding, nonvested RSUs issued and outstanding, and shares issuable pursuant to the ESPP. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Diluted loss per share for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2024, and 2025 is the same as the basic loss per share as there was a net loss for those periods, and inclusion of potentially issuable shares was anti-dilutive.

Restructuring
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company announced a workforce reduction of approximately 
7
% and office space reductions in certain markets (collectively, the “restructuring plan”) in furtherance of its efforts to improve operating margins and advance the Company’s objective of profitable growth.
Lease termination costs were accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases. The Company paid $
0.8
 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 to exercise an early termination clause to exit a facility during fiscal 2024, which was accounted for as a lease modification. 
The Company 
incurred charges
 in the fourth quarter of the Company’s fiscal 2023 of $
4.8
 million in connection with the restructuring plan. The accrual for severance and related benefit costs of $
5.0
 million for terminated employees was included in accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2023 and was paid in the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal 2024.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share amounts and unless otherwise indicated)
Note 20. 
Subsequent Events
Effective February 1, 2025, Pierre Naudé retired as the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Sean Desmond was appointed to succeed Mr. Naudé as the Company's new President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Company's Board of Directors. On the same date, Mr. Naudé was appointed Executive Chairman of the Board.
In February 2025, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, nCino OpCo, acquired all of the outstanding equity of Alphapack, Co. dba Sandbox Banking ("Sandbox Banking"), a digital transformation leader serving the financial services industry. The aggregate purchase price for the Sandbox Banking acquisition totaled $
52.5
 million, subject to customary adjustments, with an additional earn-out opportunity of up to $
10.0
 million and was funded with proceeds from the 2024 Credit Facility. The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
. The Company is in the process of finalizing the accounting for this transaction and will complete the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2026.
In March 2025, the Company repaid $
50.0
 million on the 2024 Credit Facility.
In March 2025, we recorded a realized gain of $
1.2
 million from the sale of all our shares in Zest AI. See Note 16 "Related-Party Transactions" for additional information.
In March 2025, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire up to $
100.0
 million of the Company's common stock. 
Under the stock repurchase program, the Company may make repurchases, from time to time, through open market purchases, block trades, in privately negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase transactions, or by other means. Open market repurchases will be structured to occur in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The Company may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases under this authorization. The volume, price, timing, and manner of any repurchases will be determined at the Company’s discretion, subject to general market conditions, as well as the Company’s management of capital, general business conditions, other investment opportunities, regulatory requirements and other factors. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific amount of common stock, has no time limit, and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time without notice at the discretion of nCino’s Board of Directors. The stock repurchase program will be funded using existing cash and cash equivalents, credit facility capacity and/or future cash flows.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures at January 31, 2025, the last day of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, at January 31, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 based on the guidelines established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2025.
In March 2024 we completed our acquisition of DocFox, in April 2024 we completed our acquisition of ILT, and in November 2024 we completed our acquisition of FullCircl. We accounted for these acquisitions as business combinations as discussed in Note 6 "Business Combinations" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of DocFox, ILT, and FullCircl. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC staff's general guidance that an assessment of internal controls over financial reporting of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management's assessment for one year from the date of acquisition. We have included the financial results of DocFox, ILT, and FullCircl in the consolidated financial statements from the dates of their respective acquisitions and on a combined basis accounted for approximately 0.7% and 0.1% of total and net assets, respectively, as of January 31, 2025 and 1.9% and 2.5% of revenues and net loss, respectively for the year then ended. 
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Following the acquisitions of DocFox, ILT, and FullCircl as noted above, we are in the process of reviewing the internal control structures of DocFox, ILT, and FullCircl and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes as we continue to integrate DocFox, ILT, and FullCircl into our overall internal control over financial reporting process.  There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Table of Contents
Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
