Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation - Tax receivable agreement."
Critical accounting policies and estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments. See “Item 8. Financial statements and supplementary data - Summary of significant accounting policies” for a summary of our significant accounting policies, and discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
Revenue recognition
Goosehead provides personal and commercial property and casualty insurance brokerage services for its clients through a network of corporate-owned offices and franchise units. Goosehead is compensated for the insurance brokerage services that it provides for clients in the form of commission revenue, agency fees, royalty fees, and contingent commissions. 
64
The transaction price for commissions revenue and royalty fees is set as an estimate of the variable consideration to be received for the current policy term. This estimate includes the fixed consideration due based on the contractual terms of the current policy and adjustments for estimates of modifications of the contractual terms of the current policy and/or termination of the policy before the end of the current term. This variable consideration is constrained to the extent that it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. 
The Company adjusts its estimate of revenue recognized for commissions and royalty fees based on cash collections during the term of the policy. 
Commissions revenue is earned at a point in time on the effective date of the policy. Royalty fees are earned over time as the underlying policies are placed.
The transaction price for contingent commissions is estimated based on all available information and constrained such that 
it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. Contingent commissions revenue
 is recognized over time as the Company completes its performance obligations as the underlying policies are placed and other contractual obligations are met.
Certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are capitalized. The Company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain franchise contracts. These deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying franchise fee and are included in Other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of  December 31, 2024. 
Liabilities under tax receivable agreement
In connection with the Offering, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with the Pre-IPO LLC Members that provides for the payment by us to the Pre-IPO LLC Members of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of (i) any increase in tax basis in Goosehead Financial, LLC’s assets resulting from (a) the acquisition of LLC Units using the net proceeds from any future offering, (b) redemptions or exchanges by the Pre-IPO LLC Members of LLC Units and the corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock for shares of our Class A common stock or (c) payments under the tax receivable agreement, and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed arising as a result of payments made under the tax receivable agreement.
The actual increase in tax basis from future redemptions and exchanges, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the timing of any future redemptions, exchanges or purchases of the LLC Units held by Pre-IPO LLC Members, the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the purchase, redemption or exchange, the extent to which redemptions or exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of the taxable income that we generate in the future, the tax rates then applicable and the portion of our payments under the tax receivable agreement constituting imputed interest.
As of December 31, 2024, as a result of the prior redemptions of LLC Units, we recognized liabilities totaling $160.1 million relating to our obligations under the tax receivable agreement.
65
Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risks
Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as premium amounts, interest rates, and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk through our Book of Business and borrowings under our Credit Agreement.
Insurance premium pricing within the P&C insurance industry has historically been cyclical, based on the underwriting capacity of the insurance industry and economic conditions. External events, such as terrorist attacks and man-made and natural disasters can also have significant impacts on the insurance market. We use the terms ‘‘soft market’’ and ‘‘hard market’’ to describe the business cycles experienced by the industry. A soft market is an insurance market characterized by a period of declining premium rates, which can negatively affect commissions earned by insurance agents. A hard market is an insurance market characterized by a period of rising premium rates, which, absent other changes, can positively affect commissions earned by insurance agents.
The Company represents over 200 insurance carriers, of which 54 provide national coverage. During 2024, three carriers represented more than 10% of total revenue at 19%, 15%, and 10%.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $93.1 million of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement, which bears interest on a floating basis tied to SOFR and therefore is subject to changes in the associated interest expense. The effect of an immediate hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Goosehead Insurance, Inc.  
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Goosehead Insurance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Commissions and Agency Fees and Franchise Revenues – New and Renewal Commissions and New and Renewal Royalty Fees — Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description

Goosehead is compensated for the insurance brokerage services that it provides for clients in the form of commission revenue, agency fees, royalty fees, and contingent commissions. The transaction price for commissions and royalty fees revenue is set as an estimate of the variable consideration to be received for the current policy term. This estimate includes fixed consideration due based on the contractual terms of the current policy, adjustments for estimates of modifications of the contractual terms of the current policy and/or termination of the policy before the end of the current term, and constraint of the variable consideration to the extent that it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2024, commissions and agency fees was $139.1 million, of which $74.9 million relates to renewal commissions and $24.6 million relates to new business commissions. For the year ended December 31, 2024, franchise revenue was $174.5 million, of which $138.9 million relates to renewal royalty fees and $27.1 million relates to new business royalty fees. 
We identified renewal and new business commissions and renewal and new business royalty fees revenue as a critical audit matter because of the judgments and assumptions necessary for management to estimate the variable consideration to be received for the current policy term. This required a high degree of auditor judgment when 
68
performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates of variable consideration and required extensive audit effort when performing those audit procedures due to the volume of commissions contracts. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
Our audit procedures related to management’s estimates of the variable consideration in recognizing revenue for renewal and new business commissions and renewal and new business royalty fees revenue included the following, among others:
•
We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over commissions and royalty fees revenue, including management’s controls over its estimates of the variable consideration.
•
For a sample of commissions and royalty fees revenue transactions, we tested the recording of cash receipts by agreeing the amounts recognized to source documents.
•
We developed an independent expectation of the variable consideration estimates for commissions and royalty fees revenue based on historical policy and commissions data.
•
We evaluated management's variable consideration estimates for commissions and royalty fees revenue made at year end by performing the following:
◦
Tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculation of the variable consideration estimates. 
◦
Tested the accuracy and completeness of underlying data, including historical policy and commissions data, used in management’s calculation of the variable consideration estimates.
•
We performed retrospective reviews of management’s variable consideration  estimates to identify potential bias in the determination of commissions and royalty fees revenue.
•
We evaluated whether publicly available information contradicted management’s assumptions.

Goosehead Insurance, Inc.
Notes to consolidated financial statements
1. 
Organization
On May 1, 2018 Goosehead Insurance, Inc. ("GSHD") completed the Offering of 
9,810
 thousand shares of Class A common stock at a price of $
10.00
 per share, which included 
1,280
 thousand shares issued pursuant to the underwriter's over-allotment option. GSHD became the sole managing member of Goosehead Financial, LLC (“GF”). GF was organized on January 1, 2016 as a Delaware Limited Liability Company and is headquartered in Westlake, TX. The operations of GF represent the predecessor to GSHD prior to the Offering, and the consolidated entities of GF are described in more detail below.
GSHD (collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”) provides personal and commercial property and casualty insurance brokerage services for its clients through a network of corporate-owned offices and franchise units across the nation.
The operations of the corporate-owned offices are recorded in Texas Wasatch Insurance Services, L.P. (“TWIS”)—a Texas limited partnership headquartered in Westlake, TX and operating since 2003. TWIS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Goosehead Insurance Holdings ("GIH"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GF. The Company had 14 corporate-owned offices in operation at December 31, 2024, 14 at December 31, 2023, and 12 at December 31, 2022.
The operations of the franchise units are recorded in Goosehead Insurance Agency, LLC (“GIA”)—a Delaware limited liability company headquartered in Westlake, TX and operating since 2011. GIA is 
100
% owned by GIH, which is 
100
% owned by GF. Franchisees are provided access to insurance Carrier Appointments, product training, technology infrastructure, client service centers and back office services. During years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company onboarded 
97
, 
209
, and 
496
 franchise locations, respectively and had 
1,103
, 
1,226
, and 
1,413
 operating franchise locations as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively. 
No
 franchises were purchased by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
In connection with the Offering, both Goosehead Management, LLC (“GM”) and Texas Wasatch Insurance Holdings Group LLC (“TWIHG”) became wholly owned indirect subsidiaries of GF. Both GM and TWIHG are non-operating holding companies created to receive management fees from the operating entities TWIS and GIA.
Reorganization Transactions
In connection with the Offering, the Company completed the following transactions (the "Reorganization Transactions"):
•
The GF limited liability company agreement was amended to, among other things, i) appoint GSHD as the sole managing member of GF and ii) modify the capital structure of GF by reclassifying the interests previously held by Pre-IPO LLC Members into a single new class of non-voting LLC Units.
•
GSHD was authorized to issue 
two
 classes of common stock. 
9,810
 thousand shares of Class A common stock were issued pursuant to the Offering, including the underwriters' over-allotment option. 
22,747
 thousand shares of Class B common stock were issued to the Pre-IPO LLC Members in an amount equal to the number of LLC Units held by each such Pre-IPO LLC Member in exchange for certain management rights of GF. Each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitles its holder to 
one
 vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of GSHD's stockholders. Each share of Class B common stock can be exchanged for 
one
 share of Class A common stock or, at GSHD's discretion, a cash payment equal to the volume weighted average market price of 
one
 share of Class A common stock, thus canceling the share of Class B common stock on a 
one
-for-one basis. 
•
The Goosehead Management Holders and Texas Wasatch Holders indirectly transferred their ownership interests in GM and TWIHG, respectively, to GSHD in exchange for the Goosehead Management Note and Texas Wasatch Note. The aggregate principal amount of the Goosehead Management Note and the Texas Wasatch Note was approximately $
114
 million. Because the net proceeds from the Offering were insufficient to repay the aggregate principal amount of the notes, 
3,724
 thousand shares of Class A common stock were issued to the Goosehead Management Holders and the Texas Wasatch Holders for the difference. GSHD contributed direct and indirect ownership interests in each of TWIHG and GM to GF. 
76
Following completion of the Reorganization Transactions and the Offering, GSHD owned 
37.3
% of GF and the Pre-IPO LLC Members owned the remaining 
62.7
%. GSHD is the sole managing member of GF and, although GSHD holds a minority economic interest in GF, GSHD has the sole voting power and control of management of GF. Accordingly, GSHD consolidates the financial results of GF and reports noncontrolling interest in GSHD's consolidated financial statements.

2. 
Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of GSHD and our subsidiaries are presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC for annual reports on Form 10-K and are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassification
Certain amounts previously reported in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform to the current period's presentation.
The Company elected to change its presentation of cash flows associated with "Premiums payable" from operating activities to present them as financing activities, net, within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows within the caption "Customer premiums, net". This reclassification had no impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Balance Sheets, or Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.
Significant accounting policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates as more information becomes known.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts that, at times, may exceed federally insured limits; however, the Company has not historically experienced any losses in these accounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk. 
The Company earns interest on its cash balance that is held in interest-bearing checking accounts. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $
1.6
 million in interest income within Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
No
 interest was earned during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have any cash equivalents.
Restricted cash
The Company holds premiums received from the insured, but not yet remitted to the insurance carrier in a fiduciary capacity.
 Premiums received but not yet remitted included in restricted cash were $
3.7
 million and $
2.1
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The following is a reconciliation of our cash and restricted cash balances as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 (

Commissions and agency fees receivable
Upon issuance of a new policy, the Company typically collects the first premium payment from the insured and then remits the full premium amount to the insurance carrier. The insurance carrier collects the remaining premiums 
77
directly from the insured and remits the applicable commissions to the Company. Accordingly, as reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, commissions are receivables from the insurance carriers. These direct-bill arrangements consist of a high volume of transactions with small premium amounts, with the billing controlled by the insurance carriers. The income statement and balance sheet effects of the commissions are recorded at the contract effective date and generally are based on a percentage of premiums for insurance coverage. During 2024, the Company wrote with over 
200
 insurance carriers, of which 
54
 provided national coverage. In 2024, three carriers represented more than 10% of total revenue at 
19
%, 
15
%, and 
10
%. In 2023, two carriers represented more than 10% of total revenue at 
16
% and 
12
%. In 2022, two carriers represented more than 10% of total revenue at 
14
% and 
12
%. 
In select states, agents have the option to charge an agency fee for the placement of the insurance policy. These non-refundable fees are recorded as receivable on the date the policy is effective with the insurance carrier.
Allowance for uncollectible agency fees
The Company records agency fees receivable net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated for the related agency fees receivable balances, which anticipated loss is charged to bad debts. The agency fees receivable balance consists of numerous small-balance, homogeneous accounts. The Company calculates the allowance based on collection history and writes off all uncollected agency fee balances outstanding over ninety days.
Receivable from franchisees
Receivable from franchisees consists of franchise fees receivable net of an allowance for uncollectible franchise fees and unamortized discount on franchise fees; royalty fees receivable; and notes receivable from franchisees.
Franchise fees receivable
At the start date of the franc
hise agreement, the Company records an entry to establish a franchise fees receivable and a contract liability. The contract liability will be amortized to franchise fees within Franchise revenues over the 
10-year
 life of the franchise contract. Franchis
ees have the option to pay the full amount of franchise fees up front or to pay a deposit up front and the remaining balance by payment plan over time. The franchisees that elect to pay the initial franchise fee over time pay in total an amount that exceeds the amount due had they paid the full amount up front. As such, the payment plan option is treated as a zero-interest rate note, which creates an imputation of interest. The imputed interest is recorded as a discount on the franchise fee receivable and amortized using the effective interest rate method over the life of the payment plan. The amount of interest recorded in 2024, 2023, and 2022 related to franchise fees on a payment plan was $
0.9
 million, $
1.4
 million, and $
1.4
 million, respectively, and is included in Interest income.
Allowance for uncollectible franchise fees receivable
The Company records franchise fees receivable net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated related to the franchise fees receivable balances, which anticipated loss is charged to bad debts. The franchise fees receivable balance consists of numerous small-balance, homogeneous accounts. The Company calculates the allowance based on our history of write offs for all franchise accounts. Franchise fees receivable and the related allowance is written off if the franchisee owing the balance terminates.
Royalty fees receivable
Royalty fees are recorded at the point in time when the policy becomes effective with the insurance carrier. The royalty fees are secured by the commissions of the franchisee with no historical losses incurred for uncollectible royalty fees. As such, there is 
no
 allowance for doubtful accounts relating to royalty fees.
Revenue recognition
Goosehead provides personal and commercial property and casualty insurance brokerage services for its clients through a network of corporate-owned locations and franchise units. Goosehead is compensated for the insurance brokerage services that it provides for clients in the form of commissions, agency fees, royalty fees, and contingent commissions. The Company estimates revenue and constrains the estimates such that 
it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. 
The Company adjusts its estimate of revenue recognized based on cash collections.
The Company also recognizes revenue for initial franchise fees generated from a contract between the Company and a franchisee. Initial franchise fees are recognized as revenue over the 
10-year
 life of the franchise contract, beginning on the start date of the contract.  
78
Certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are capitalized. The Company capitalizes the commission payments paid  to obtain new franchise contracts. These deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying franchise fee, and are included in Other assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
See Note 3 Revenues for further explanation of the Company's revenue recognition policy.
Property & equipment
The Company carries fixed assets at cost, less accumulated depreciation, as stated in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 
five years
 for furniture, fixtures and equipment and 
three years
 for computer equipment. Leasehold improvements are also amortized using the straight-line method and are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization is removed from the related accounts, and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is reflected in income.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and reflect amounts paid for the Company’s web domain, computer software costs, and books of business (customer accounts). The web domain is amortized over a useful life of 
fifteen years
, software costs are amortized over a useful life of 
three
 to 
ten years
, and books of business are amortized over a useful life of 
eight years
.
In May 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase Vivint Smart Home's insurance book of business, for which the Company paid $
5.8
 million in cash consideration. Total purchases of books of business during the year ended December 31, 2023 was  $
6.9
 million. We made 
no
 purchases of books of business during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Asset Impairment
The Company reviews all of its identifiable assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. In reviewing identifiable assets, if the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the respective assets, an indicator of impairment would exist, and further analysis would be required to determine whether or not a loss would need to be charged against current period earnings as a component of general and administrative expenses.
Based on a review of tangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company identified 
one
 office lease that would be subleased and completed a recoverability assessment for assets at that location. Based on the results of the recoverability assessment, the Company determined that the undiscounted cash flows of the assets were below their carrying values. As a result, the Company compared the fair values of the assets to their carrying values and recorded an impairment expense of $
0.1
 million for property and equipment and $
0.2
 million for right-of-use asset for the amount the carrying values exceeded the fair values. The Company determined the fair values by estimating sublease cash flows based on market rates for similar properties and discounted them using the Company's internal borrowing rate.
Based on a review of tangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company identified 
two
 office leases that will be subleased and completed a recoverability assessment for assets at those locations. Based on the results of the recoverability assessment, the Company determined that the undiscounted cash flows of the assets were below their carrying values. As a result, the Company compared the fair values of the assets to their carrying values and recorded an impairment expense of $
1.4
 million of property and equipment and $
1.1
 million of right-of-use asset for the amount the carrying values exceeded the fair values. The Company determined the fair values by estimating sublease cash flows based on market rates for similar properties and discounted them using the Company's internal borrowing rate.
Based on a review of intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company identified a group of internally-developed software assets that had not been placed into service and would not be completed. As a result, the Company determined the assets had no fair value and recorded an impairment expense of $
1.1
 million related to the asset group.
No additional impairment was identified during the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
79
Premiums payable
Premiums payable represent premium payments that have been received from insureds, but not yet remitted to the insurance carriers.
Deferred financing costs
Deferred financing costs incurred in connection with the issuance of debt are capitalized and amortized to interest expense in accordance with the related debt agreements. Deferred financing costs for existing debt facilities are included as a reduction in notes payable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets while deferred financing costs incurred for debt facilities not yet consummated as of the end of a reporting period are included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Lease Accounting
The primary leased asset class of the Company is real estate. For leases with an original term longer than one year, lease liabilities are initially recognized on the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, including non-lease components such as fixed common area maintenance costs and other fixed costs. A corresponding right-of-use ("ROU") asset is initially recognized equal to the lease liability adjusted for any lease prepayments, initial direct costs and lease incentives, and amortized into rent expense, which is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
The discount rates used in determining the present value of leases represent our collateralized borrowing rate considering each lease's term. Certain leases have options to renew or terminate the lease that can be exercised at the discretion of the Company. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Rent expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 See Note 15 for further information. 
Income Taxes
Prior to the Offering, GF was treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, GF's taxable income or loss was included in the taxable income of its members. Accordingly, no income tax expense was recorded for federal and state and local jurisdictions for periods prior to the Offering.
In connection with the Offering completed on May 1, 2018, the Company became a taxable entity.
The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities related to the expected future tax consequences arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Any effects of changes in income tax rates or laws are included in income tax expense in the period of enactment.
Advertising
The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred.
 Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $
1.0
 million, $
0.9
 million, and $
1.0
 million.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2020-04, 
Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting
, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP if certain criteria are met to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. ASU 2020-04 was initially effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, ASU 2022-06 extended the effective period through December 31, 2024. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The standard will ease, if warranted, the administrative requirements for accounting for the future effects of the rate reform. A substantial portion of our indebtedness bore interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on USD-LIBOR, and contained a provision to move to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") if or when LIBOR is phased out. On April 26, 2023, the Company entered into an Amendment No.1 to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement executing the provision to move to SOFR from LIBOR. Under the allowable expedients, a modification of a debt contract that is only a replacement of the reference rate is accounted for as a non-substantial modification.
80
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. The amendments require enhanced disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items, provide for the disclosure of additional measures of a segment's profit or loss used by the chief operating decision maker, require that all annual disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets be included in interim periods, and provide new segment reporting requirements for entities with a single reportable segment. The Company adopted this ASU for the annual period ended December 31, 2024 and the amendments have been applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Refer to our segment disclosure in "Note 16. Segment information" for more information.
Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. This standard requires the Company to provide further disaggregated income tax disclosures for specific categories on the effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as additional information about federal, state/local and foreign income taxes. The standard also requires the Company to annually disclose its income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by jurisdiction. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The standard is to be applied on a prospective basis, although optional retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial statement disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Suptopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. The amendment requires additional disclosures of certain costs and expenses with the notes to the financial statements. Additionally, in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01, 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Suptopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date
, which clarified that the updates are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial statement disclosures.
3. 
Revenues
Commissions and agency fees
The Company earns commissions, which are paid as a percentage of the policy premiums placed by the Company, by performing its obligation to identify, place, and make effective insurance coverage on behalf of its customer, the insured. The Company defines the term of the policy as the contractual period the policy provides insurance coverage to the insured, which is typically 1 year or less. Commissions earned for the placement of the initial policy term for a given insurance product are recorded as New Business Commissions. New Business Commissions are earned at a point in time on the effective date of the policy, which is when the customer’s unilateral right to cancel the policy without consideration expires, as the Company has no further performance obligations for the initial term once the policy is placed and made effective.
After the initial policy term for a given insurance product, the Company earns Renewal Commissions by assisting the customer to make effective a renewal policy that satisfies the customer’s current insurance coverage needs. The Company performs this obligation by monitoring the customer’s policy to ensure a renewal is offered by the carrier and that the client promptly pays the premium. Alternatively, based on the needs of the customer, the Company may assist the customer to adjust coverage terms to satisfy its current insurance coverage needs or the Company may assist the customer to re-shop the insurance coverage to identify, place, and make effective a policy that better meets those needs. Renewal Commissions are earned at a point in time upon the effective date of the renewal policy term or upon the effective date of the replacement policy identified, placed, and made effective for the customer, which is when the customer’s unilateral right to non-renew the policy expires, as the Company has no further performance obligations for that renewal policy term.
The transaction price for commissions revenue is set as an estimate of the variable consideration to be received for the current policy term. This estimate includes the fixed consideration due based on the contractual terms of the current policy and adjustments for estimates of modifications of the contractual terms of the current policy and/or termination of the policy before the end of the current term. This variable consideration is constrained to the extent that it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue.
For Agency Fees, the Company enters into a contract with the insured, in which the Company's performance obligation is to place an insurance policy. The transaction price of the agency fee is set at the time the sale is agreed upon, and is included in the contract. Agency Fee revenue is recognized at a point in time, which is the effective date of the policy.
81
Contingent commission revenue is generated from contracts between the Company and insurance carriers, for which the Company is compensated for certain growth, profitability, or other performance-based  metrics. The performance obligations for contingent commissions will vary by contract, but generally include the Company increasing profitable written premium with the insurance carrier. The transaction price for contingent commissions is estimated based on all available information and is recognized over time as the Company completes its performance obligations, as the underlying policies are placed, net of a constraint.
The Company must estimate the amount of consideration that will be received such that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable. Contingent commissions represent a form of variable consideration associated with the placement and profitability of coverage, for which we earn commissions. In connection with Topic 606, contingent commissions are estimated with a constraint applied and accrued relative to the recognition of the corresponding commissions for the period over which the contract applies. As contingent commissions are earned in relation to policies placed by the Company with the insurance carrier, the timing of recognizing contingent commissions follows a similar pattern as our commissions and fees, with any adjustments recognized when payments are received or as additional information that affects the estimate becomes available.
Franchise revenues
Franchise revenues include initial franchise fees and ongoing new and renewal royalty fees from franchisees. 
Revenue from Initial Franchise Fees is generated from a contract between the Company and a franchisee. The Company's performance obligation is to provide initial training, onboarding, ongoing support and use of the Company's business operations over the period of the franchise agreement. The transaction price is set by the franchise agreement and revenue is recognized over time as the Company completes its performance obligations.
Initial franchise fees are recognized as revenue over the 
10-year
 life of the franchise contract, beginning on the start date of the contract.  
Revenue from New and Renewal Royalty Fees is recorded by applying the sales- and usage-based royalties exception. Under the sales- and usage-based exception, the Company recognizes revenue over time as a franchise places and makes effective a policy for an insured. The transaction price for the royalty fee for each policy made effective is set as the contractual royalty rate multiplied by 
an estimate of the commissions to be received by the franchise for the current term of the policy. This estimate includes the fixed consideration due based on the contractual terms of the current policy and adjustments for estimates of modifications of the contractual terms of the current policy and/or termination of the policy before the end of the current term. This variable consideration is constrained to the extent that it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue.
Contract Costs
The Company has evaluated ASC Topic 340 - Other Assets and Deferred Cost (“ASC 340”), which requires companies to defer certain incremental costs to obtain customer contracts and certain costs to fulfill customer contracts.
Incremental costs to obtain - The Company defers certain costs to obtain customer contracts primarily as they relate to commission-based compensation plans for selling new franchise agreements. These incremental costs are deferred and amortized over a 
10-year
 period, which is consistent with the term of the contract.  The balance of costs to obtain is included with Other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
Costs to fulfill - The Company has evaluated the need to capitalize costs to fulfill customer contracts and has determined that there are no costs that meet the definition for capitalization under ASC 340.

Employee benefit obligation
The Company has adopted a qualified deferred compensation plan under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Full-time employees over the age of 
21
 with 
six months
 of service are eligible to participate. Under the plan, the Company’s contribution is based on a discretionary matching of 
100
% of salary deferral elected by each eligible employee up to a maximum of 
3
% of compensation. The Company’s matching portion vests over a 
four-year
 period, after which time the employee becomes fully vested and all future contributions will vest immediately.
Matching contributions may be changed at the discretion of the Company. Company contributions totaled $
1.5
 million, $
1.5
 million, and $
1.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

9. 
Debt
On July 21, 2021, the Company refinanced its $
25.0
 million revolving credit facility and $
80.0
 million term note payable to a $
50.0
 million revolving credit facility and $
100.0
 million term note payable in order to obtain a more favorable interest rate on the outstanding debt. The revolving credit facility and term note are collateralized by substantially all the Company's assets, which includes right to future commissions and royalties.
On April 26, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No.1 of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which provided that LIBOR should be replaced with Term SOFR.
On April 24, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, increasing the term note payable by $
25
 million and increasing the capacity of the revolving credit facility by $
25
 million to a total capacity of $
75
 million. 
At December 31, 2024, the Company had 
nothing
 drawn against the revolving credit facility and had a letter of credit of $
0.2
 million applied against the maximum borrowing availability. Thus, amounts available to draw totaled $
74.8
 million. The revolving credit facility is due in full on July 21, 2026. The aggregate principal amount of the term note as of December 31, 2024 is $
93.1
 million, payable in quarterly installments of $
2.5
 million, with a balloon payment of $
80.5
 million on July 21, 2026.
Amounts outstanding under both the term note and the revolving credit facility bear interest at Term SOFR plus a margin based on our current leverage ratio. 
The interest rates applicable for each leverage ratio tier are as follows:
Leverage Ratio
Interest Rate
< 
1.50
x
SOFR + 
175
 bps
> 
1.50
x
SOFR +

 bps
> 
2.50
x
SOFR + 
225
 bps
> 
3.50
x
SOFR + 
250
 bps
At December 31, 2024, the interest rate applicable for the credit facilities was Term SOFR plus 
175
 basis points. Interest payments on the revolving credit facility totaled $
0.2
 million, $
0.1
 million, and $
0.7
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Loan origination fees of $
0.8
 million at December 31, 2024 are reflected as a reduction to the note balance and are amortized through interest expense. The effective interest rate for the term note as of December 31, 2024 was 
7.76
%.

The Company’s note payable agreement contains certain restrictions and covenants. Under these restrictions, the Company is limited in the amount of debt incurred and distributions payable. In addition, the credit agreement contains certain change of control provisions that, if broken, would trigger a default. Finally, the Company must maintain certain financial ratios. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. 
Because of both instruments’ variable interest rate, the note payable balances at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximate their fair values using Level 2 inputs, described below.
The framework for measuring fair value provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
86

•
Level 1—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets.
•
Level 2—Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset.
•
Level 3—Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
The asset or liability’s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
Subsequent event
On January 8, 2025, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the "2025 Credit Agreement") providing for an aggregate $
300
 million term notes payable (the "2025 Initial Term Loan") and $
75
 million revolving credit facility (the "2025 Revolving Credit Facility"). The 2025 Initial Term Loan matures on January 8, 2032 and the 2025 Revolving Credit Facility matures on January 8, 2030. This credit agreement replaces the existing Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated July 21, 2021, which was repaid with the proceeds of the 2025 Initial Term Loan and terminated. Loans under the 2025 Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate of Term SOFR plus 
3.50
%. The 2025 Credit Agreement is secured by all property owned, leased or operated by the Company except for certain excluded assets.

Income taxes
As a result of the Reorganization Transactions and the Offering, GSHD became the sole managing member of GF, which is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, GF is not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by GF is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including GSHD, on a pro rata basis. GSHD is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, with respect to GSHD's allocable share of income of GF.

GSHD has deferred tax assets resulting from tax basis adjustments to the assets of GF arising from redemptions of LLC Units and corresponding exchanges of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock. These tax basis adjustments have reduced the amount of tax we are required to pay, and they are expected to reduce the amount of tax that GSHD would otherwise be required to pay in the future. See tax receivable agreement subsection below for additional details.
GSHD also has income tax net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes of $
83.4
 million and $
12.4
 million (post apportionment pre-tax), respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are carried forward indefinitely and are limited to 80% of taxable income in a given year. The state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2033.
Uncertain tax positions
GSHD has determined there are 
no
 material uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024.
Tax receivable agreement
GF has made an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the “Code”) effective for each taxable year in which a redemption or exchange of LLC Units and corresponding Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock occurs. Prior redemptions and exchanges have resulted, and future taxable redemptions or exchanges are expected to result in tax basis adjustments to the assets of GF that will be allocated to the Company and thus produce favorable tax attributes. These tax attributes would not be available to us in the absence of those transactions. These tax basis adjustments have reduced the amount of tax we are required to pay, and are expected to reduce the amount of tax that GSHD would otherwise be required to pay in the future.
GSHD entered into a tax receivable agreement with the Pre-IPO LLC Members on May 1, 2018 that provides for the payment by GSHD to the Pre-IPO LLC Members of 
85
% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that GSHD actually realizes as a result of (i) any increase in tax basis in 
88
GSHD's assets and (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest deemed arising as a result of payments made under the tax receivable agreement.
During the years ended December 31, 2024,  2023 and 2022, an aggregate of 
0.3
 million, 
1.5
 million and 
2.4
 million LLC Units, respectively, were redeemed by the Pre-IPO LLC Members for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock. In connection with these redemptions, we received 
0.3
 million, 
1.5
 million and 
2.4
 million LLC Units, which resulted in an increase in the tax basis of our investment in GF subject to the provisions of the TRA. We recognized a liability for the tax receivable agreement payments due to the Pre-IPO LLC Members, representing 
85
% of the aggregate tax benefits we expect to realize from the tax basis increases related to the redemptions of LLC Units, after concluding it was probable that such tax receivable agreement payments would be paid based on our estimates of future taxable income. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total amount of payments due to the Pre-IPO LLC Members under the tax receivable agreement was $
160.1
 million and $
149.3
 million, respectively, of which $
0.0
 million and $
0.0
 million, respectively, was current and included in Accounts payables and accrued expenses on the Consolidated balance sheets.
11. 
Stockholder's equity
Class A Common Stock
GSHD has a total of 
24,668
 thousand and 
24,966
 thousand shares of its Class A common stock outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Each share of Class A common stock holds economic rights and entitles its holder to 
one
 vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of GSHD.
Class B Common Stock
GSHD has a total of 
12,620
 thousand and 
12,954
 thousand shares of its Class B common stock outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Each share of Class B common stock has no economic rights but entitles its holder to 
one
 vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of GSHD.
Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to GSHD's stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law, by agreement, or by GSHD's certificate of incorporation.
Correction of Prior Period Balances
Subsequent to the issuance of the Company’s Annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company determined that it did not properly apply the guidance under ASC 810-10-45-23 in determining the allocation of activity related to the exercise of stock options, equity-based compensation, activity under employee stock purchase plan, and redemption of LLC Units. The Company also identified an error in the recording of deferred tax adjustments related to Tax Receivable Agreement. The net impact of these misstatements was an overstatement of additional paid-in capital, an understatement of accumulated deficit, and an understatement of noncontrolling interest as presented in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity and consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. As a result, the Company restated the prior period financial statements to correct the errors. Additionally, the Company has changed the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity presentation to reflect the reallocation of noncontrolling interest within the specific line items resulting in reallocation instead of as a separate line item. The Company will also correct previously issued quarterly financial statements for such misstatements in future filings, as applicable.
The Company evaluated the materiality of these misstatements from quantitative and qualitative perspectives and concluded the misstatements are not material to the prior periods. 
The amounts previously reported within the Company’s financial statements have been revised to reflect the corrected balances as presented below (in thousands):

Earnings Per Share
The following table sets forth the calculation of basic earnings per share ("EPS") based on net income attributable to GSHD for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, divided by the basic weighted average number of Class A common stock as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 
(in thousands, except per share amounts
).
Diluted EPS of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net income attributable to GSHD by the weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive securities.
Shares of the Company’s Class B common stock do not share in the earnings or losses attributable to Goosehead Insurance, Inc. and are therefore not participating securities. As such, separate presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock under the two-class method has not been presented. Shares of the Company’s Class B common stock are, however, considered potentially dilutive shares of Class A common stock because shares of Class B common stock, together with the related LLC Units, are exchangeable into shares of Class A common stock on a 
one
-for-one basis. The Company calculates the effects of the conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares using the "if-converted" method and includes such effects in the calculation of diluted EPS if the effects are dilutive.
The following table summarizes the calculation of EPS for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022

(1) For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the impact of the conversion of Class B common shares to Class A common shares calculated under the if-converted method was dilutive, and as such, (a) 
12,749
 thousand and 
13,769
 thousand common shares (assuming the conversion of all outstanding class B common stock) were included in the Weighted average outstanding Class A common shares - Diluted and (b) $
13.9
 million and $
7.0
 million of noncontrolling interest net income (after incremental tax effect from assuming conversion of all outstanding class B common stock), was added back to Net income available to GSHD - Diluted. For the year 2022, the impact of the conversion of Class B common shares to Class A common shares is excluded from the calculation of Diluted EPS because inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive. 
(2) The dilutive effect of stock options is computed using the treasury stock method. 
869
 thousand, 
1,560
 thousand, and 
2,390
 thousand stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Share Repurchase Program
On April 24, 2024, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to $
100
 million of our Class A common stock through March 31, 2025. The share repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases will be determined at the discretion of management in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions. Class A common 
94
stock acquired under the program will be retired upon repurchase. Additionally, for every repurchased share of Class A common stock, the Company will direct GF to repurchase, at the price paid to repurchase such share, and cancel an LLC unit of GF held by the Company.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased and retired 
1,045
 thousand shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate $
63.2
 million. All repurchases were made in open-market transactions and recorded at their aggregate transaction cost inclusive of commissions and excise taxes. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program to repurchase up to $
36.8
 million of the Company's Class A common stock.
12. 
Noncontrolling interest
Following the Offering, GSHD became the sole managing member of GF and, as a result, it consolidates the financial results of GF. GSHD reports a noncontrolling interest representing the economic interest in GF held by the other members of GF.
GF makes distributions to the LLC Unit holders on a pro rata basis to facilitate the LLC Unit holder's quarterly tax payments. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, GF made distributions of $
13.3
 million and $
28.1
 million, of which $
4.8
 million and $
10.9
 million was made to Pre-IPO LLC Members. The remaining $
8.5
 million and $
17.1
 million was made to GSHD and was eliminated in consolidation.
Under the amended and restated Goosehead Financial, LLC Agreement ("GF LLC Agreement"), the Pre-IPO LLC Members have the right, from and after the completion of the Offering (subject to the terms of the amended and restated Goosehead Financial, LLC Agreement), to require GSHD to redeem all or a portion of their LLC Units for, at GSHD's election, newly-issued shares of Class A common stock on a 
one
-for-one basis or a cash payment equal to the volume weighted average market price of one share of GSHD's Class A common stock for each LLC Unit redeemed (subject to customary adjustments, including for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications) in accordance with the terms of the amended and restated Goosehead Financial, LLC Agreement. Additionally, in the event of a redemption request by a Pre-IPO LLC Member, GSHD may, at its option, effect a direct exchange of cash or Class A common stock for LLC Units in lieu of such a redemption. Shares of Class B common stock will be canceled on a 
one
-for-one basis if GSHD, at the election of a Pre-IPO LLC Member, redeems or exchanges LLC Units of such Pre-IPO LLC Member pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated Goosehead Financial, LLC Agreement. Except for transfers to GSHD pursuant to the amended and restated Goosehead Financial, LLC Agreement or to certain permitted transferees, the Pre-IPO LLC Members are not permitted to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any LLC Units or shares of Class B common stock.
During 2024 and 2023, an aggregate of 
0.3
 million and 
1.5
 million LLC Units, respectively, were redeemed by the noncontrolling interest holders. Pursuant to the GF LLC Agreement, we issued 
0.3
 million and 
1.5
 million shares of Class A common stock in connection with these redemptions and received 
0.3
 million and 
1.5
 million LLC Interests, increasing our ownership interest in GF. Simultaneously, and in connection with these redemptions, 
0.3
 million and 
1.5
 million shares of Class B common stock were surrendered and canceled.
The following table summarizes the ownership interest in GF as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

, 
904,000
, and 
1,482,000
 to its Board of Directors and Managing Directors in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Board of Directors stock option awards have a 
three-year
 service period and vest in 
12
 equal quarterly installments over the service period. Managing Director stock options awards granted in 2021 have a 
four-year
 service period and vest in 
three
 equal annual installments, beginning at the end of the second year of service. Employee awards granted beginning in 2022 have a 
three-year
 service period and vest in equal annual installments beginning at the end of the first year of service. Both Board of Director and Managing Director stock option awards have a maximum contract term of 
ten years
 from the grant date. Upon exercise of an option, the Company issues a new share of stock.
The Company determines the grant date fair value of its stock option awards using the Black-Scholes valuation model and has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur.

14. 
Dividends
The Company did 
not
 approve or pay any dividends during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
On January 9, 2025, GF declared a special distribution of $
175
 million, which was paid in cash on January 31, 2025 to holders of record of LLC Units, including to GSHD, as of the close of business on January 21, 2025. The special distribution resulted in a payment of $
59
 million to our noncontrolling interest holders. On January 9, 2025, the board of directors of the Company declared a one-time special cash dividend of $
5.91
 to all holders of Class A common stock of GSHD as of the close of business on January 21, 2025, which was paid in cash on January 31, 2025 for a total of $
146
 million. $
1.22
 of the special cash dividend was funded by cash received by GSHD from prior tax distributions from GF that are in excess of the corporate income taxes payable by GSHD. The remaining $
4.69
 of the special dividend was funded by the cash received by the Company from the special distribution by GF.
Any future special dividends will be declared at the sole discretion of GF's managing members, with respect to GF, and the Company's board of directors, with respect to GSHD. In determining whether a future special dividend will be declared by the Company, the board of directors may, at its sole discretion, consider the following: the Company's financial condition and operating results, the Company's available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, the Company's capital requirements, any contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, general economic and business conditions, and such other factors or conditions as the board of directors deems relevant.
15. 
Leases
At December 31, 2024, Goosehead was obligated under a number of operating leases, exclusively leases for premises and equipment used for business purposes. These leases generally have terms of 
8
 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Company’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rent payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components and variable in nature. The Company elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real 
97
estate and equipment leases. As such, real estate and equipment lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components.
Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the fixed future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that represents the Company’s collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term. We estimate this for our portfolio of leases using information obtained from our bankers. The ROU asset also includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rent expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in occupancy expense within General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated statements of operations.

Segment information
The Company is organized into a single reportable segment: insurance distribution. The personal lines insurance distribution segment provides clients with access to home, auto, umbrella, motorcycle, flood, and other ancillary insurance products. The Company derives its revenue entirely from within the United States and manages business activities on a consolidated basis. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer.
The accounting policies of the insurance distribution segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The chief operating decision maker uses net income, as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, to assess performance and allocate resources for the insurance distribution segment. The significant segment expense categories regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker are the same as those included on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The measure of segment assets is total assets as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The chief operating decision maker uses net income to assess performance by examining period-over-period trends, benchmarking to the Company's competitors, and monitoring budget versus actual results. The chief operating decision maker uses net income to evaluate income generated from segment assets in deciding whether to reinvest profits into the segment or into other parts of the entity, such as for share repurchases or dividends.
17. 
Litigation
From time to time, GSHD may be involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of the Company's business. The Company records accruals for legal contingencies to the extent that it has concluded that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not probable, the Company does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. In the opinion of the Company's management, the likely results of any ongoing legal matters are not expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
On November 10, 2022, a verified stockholder class action complaint for declaratory relief, captioned Mickey Dollens v. Goosehead Insurance, Inc., C.A. No. 2022-1018-JTL, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Dollens Action”), alleging certain corporate governance documents adopted by the Company were invalid under Delaware law. On August 8, 2023, the parties entered into a proposed settlement providing for certain non-monetary benefits to the class (i.e., revisions to the Company's Stockholder Agreement). Additionally, the plaintiffs have petitioned the Court for attorneys' fees and litigation expenses.  The matter is currently stayed. While there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of the petition, the Company believes a potential loss, if any, would not be material.

Item 9A. Controls and procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024. 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the results of our evaluation, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in their report herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Goosehead Insurance, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Goosehead Insurance, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
