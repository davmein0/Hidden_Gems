Our Class B Common Stock is not listed nor traded on any stock exchange.
Holders of Record
As of January 31, 2025, there were 6 shareholders of record of our Class A common stock. The number of record holders does not include persons who held shares of our Class A common stock in nominee or "street name" accounts through brokers. As of January 31, 2025, there were 38 shareholders of record of our Class B common stock.
Dividend Policy
Subject to funds being legally available, we intend to cause Goosehead Financial, LLC to make pro rata distributions to the Pre-IPO LLC Members and us in an amount at least sufficient to allow us and the Pre-IPO LLC Members to pay all applicable taxes, to make payments under the tax receivable agreement we entered into with the Pre-IPO LLC Members and to pay our corporate and other overhead expenses. The declaration and payment of any dividends by Goosehead Insurance, Inc. is at the sole discretion of our board of directors, which may change our dividend policy at any time. Our board of directors will take into account:
•
general economic and business conditions;
•
our financial condition and operating results;
•
our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs;
•
our capital requirements;
•
contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries (including Goosehead Financial, LLC) to us; and
•
such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant.
Goosehead Insurance, Inc. is a holding company and does not have material assets other than its ownership of LLC Units in Goosehead Financial, LLC, and as a consequence, our ability to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our Class A common stock is subject to the ability of Goosehead Financial, LLC to provide distributions to us. If Goosehead Financial, LLC makes such distributions, the Pre-IPO LLC Members will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions from Goosehead Financial, LLC. However, because we must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreement, amounts ultimately distributed as dividends to holders of our Class A common stock are expected to be less than the amounts distributed by Goosehead Financial, LLC to the Pre-IPO LLC Members on a per share basis. See "Item 13. Certain relationships and related transactions, and director independence."
Assuming Goosehead Financial, LLC makes distributions to its members in any given year, the determination to pay dividends, if any, to our Class A common stockholders out of the portion, if any, of such distributions remaining after our payment of taxes, tax receivable agreement payments and expenses (any such portion, an “excess distribution”) will be made by our board of directors. Because our board of directors may determine to pay or not pay dividends to our Class A common stockholders, our Class A common stockholders may not necessarily receive dividend distributions relating to excess distributions, even if Goosehead Financial, LLC makes such distributions to us.
On January 31, 2025, Goosehead Financial, LLC paid a special cash distribution of $175 million to holders of record of LLC Units, including us, as of the close of business on January 21, 2025. In addition, on January 31, 2025, a one-time special cash dividend of $5.91 per share of Class A common stock was paid to holders of record of our Class A 
47
common stock as of the close of business on January 21, 2025. $1.22 of the special dividend was funded by cash received by us from prior tax distributions from Goosehead Financial, LLC that were in excess of the corporate income taxes payable by us. The remaining $4.69 of the special dividend was funded by the cash received by us from the distribution by Goosehead Financial, LLC.
Sales of Unregistered Securities
None. 
Subject to the terms of the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Goosehead Financial, LLC, dated as of May 1, 2018, each LLC Unit is redeemable (along with the cancellation of the corresponding share of Class B common stock) for one share of Class A common stock

Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
Overview
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under “Risk factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report.
This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("the SEC"). We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, Core Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EP
S
 non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company’s operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent under U.S. GAAP, and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future.
Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. These financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for further discussion of our Core Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EP

Factors affecting our results of operations
We believe that the most significant factors affecting our results of operations include:
•
Investment in growth.
 We continue to invest in expanding our national footprint, increasing our revenue-producing headcount, and increasing the level of support provided to our salespeople. Our ability to attract and retain top corporate sales agents and franchise owners, ramp up new agent productivity, and retain existing and future Policies in Force are key to continued profitable growth.
•
Investment in technology.
 We continue to develop and invest in our technology platform to drive scalability, adaptability, and efficiency. We believe our significant investment in proprietary technology is a key competitive advantage that supports, and will continue to support, our growth and operating margins.
•
Continued penetration of Franchisees into existing markets.
 We will continue to market actively for new franchises in our established markets, which represent over 98% of the U.S. population. We are now licensed with the necessary state departments of commerce and insurance and registered as a franchisor in all 50 states in the U.S. 
•
Continued retention of existing Book of Business.
 We have navigated macroeconomic challenges to maintain high levels of Client Retention. Client Retention is key to future profitability. 
•
Increase in margins as business shifts from new to renewal.
 Because we are entitled to a higher percentage of Royalty Fees after the first term of a policy and the higher level of back-office support needed during the first term of an insurance policy, the Company begins to see higher levels of profitability on Renewal Revenue. We will focus simultaneously on converting New Business Revenue to Renewal Revenue through our retention efforts, and on continuing to grow New Business Revenue that will convert and allow us to expand our margins in future periods.
•
Strength of the insurance market or particular lines of business.
 We generate the majority of our revenues through commissions, which are calculated as a percentage of the total insurance policy premium. A softening of the insurance market or the particular lines of business that are our focus, characterized by a period of declining premium rates, could negatively impact our profitability. 
•
Seasonality and cyclicality of housing market conditions.
 The majority of our new accounts are sourced by referral sources tied to home closing transactions. Major slowdowns in the various housing markets Goosehead serves, including as a result of changes in prevailing interest rates or U.S. monetary policies that affect interest rates, could impact our ability to generate new business. We experience seasonality and revenue related to the sale of insurance policies throughout the course of a calendar year that is tied to the seasonality of new home sales. Revenue from home insurance leads is higher from April to August and lower from October through January. While this can impact month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter results, we expect productivity to normalize year-over-year.
•
Increases in interest rates.
 Our variable rate debt, including our Credit Agreement, exposes us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same. To the extent that interest rate risk materializes and is not fully mitigated, the resulting increase in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
•
Effect of natural or man-made disasters
. Any increases in loss ratios due to natural or man-made disasters could impact our Contingent Commissions, which are primarily driven by both growth and loss ratio metrics.
•
Cost of being a public company
.
 To operate as a public company, we are required to continue to implement changes in certain aspects of our business and develop, manage, and train management-level and other employees to comply with on-going public company requirements. We also incur expenses as a public company, including public reporting obligations, proxy statements, stockholder meetings, stock exchange fees and transfer agent fees.
51
Effects of the reorganization on our corporate structure
Goosehead Insurance, Inc. was formed for the purpose of the Offering and has engaged to date only in activities related to Goosehead Financial, LLC. Goosehead Insurance, Inc. is a holding company and its sole material asset is a controlling ownership and profits interest in Goosehead Financial, LLC. All of our business is conducted through Goosehead Financial, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the financial results of Goosehead Financial, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements of Goosehead Insurance, Inc. Goosehead Financial, LLC is currently taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and, as a result, its members, including Goosehead Insurance, Inc., pay taxes with respect to their allocable shares of its net taxable income.
Prior redemptions and exchanges of LLC Units have resulted, and we expect future redemptions and exchanges will result in increases in the tax basis in our share of the tangible and intangible assets of Goosehead Financial, LLC that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis have reduced the amount of tax we are required to pay, and may reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. The tax receivable agreement requires Goosehead Insurance, Inc. to pay 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize to the Pre-IPO LLC Members. Furthermore, payments under the tax receivable agreement give rise to additional tax benefits and therefore additional payments under the tax receivable agreement itself. See "Item 13. Certain relationships and related transactions, and director independence".
Certain income statement line items
Revenues
In 2024, revenue increased by 20% to $314.5 million from $261.3 million in 2023. Total Written Premium growth, which is the best indicator of future revenue growth, increased 29% to $3.8 billion in 2024 from $3.0 billion in 2023. Total Written Premiums Placed drive our current and future Core Revenue and give us potential opportunities to earn Ancillary Revenue in the form of Contingent Commissions. Our various revenue streams do not equally contribute to the long-term value of Goosehead. For instance, Renewal Revenue and Renewal Royalty Fees are more predictable and have higher margin profiles, thus are higher quality revenue streams for the Company. Alternatively, Contingent Commissions, while high margin, are unpredictable and dependent on insurance company underwriting and forces of nature and thus are lower quality revenue for the Company. Our revenue streams can be viewed in three distinct categories: Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, and Ancillary Revenue, which are non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, and Ancillary Revenue to total revenue, the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are set forth in the "Key performance indicators" section of Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this Form 10-K.
Core Revenue:
•
Renewal Commissions - highly predictable, higher-margin revenue stream, which is managed by our service team.
•
Renewal Royalty Fees - highly predictable, higher-margin revenue stream, which is managed by our service team. For policies in their first renewal term, we see an increase in our share of royalties from 20% to 50% on the commission paid by the Carriers. 
•
New Business Commissions - predictable based on agent headcount and consistent ramp-up of agents, but lower margin than Renewal Commissions because of higher commissions paid to agents and higher back-office costs associated with policies in their first term. This revenue stream has predictably converted into higher-margin Renewal Commissions historically, and we expect this to continue moving forward.
•
New Business Royalty Fees - predictable based on franchise count and consistent ramp-up of franchises, but lower margin than Renewal Royalty Fees because the Company only receives a royalty fee of 20% on the commissions paid by the Carrier in the first term of every policy and higher back-office costs associated with policies in their first term. This revenue stream has predictably converted into higher-margin Renewal Royalty Fees historically, and we expect this to continue moving forward.
•
Agency Fees - although predictable based on agent count, Agency Fees do not renew like New Business Commissions and Renewal Commissions. 
Cost Recovery Revenue:
•
Initial Franchise Fees - Cost Recovery Revenue stream charged one time per franchise unit that covers the Company's costs to recruit, train, onboard, and support the franchise for the first year. These fees are fully 
52
earned and non-refundable when a franchise attends our initial training and are recognized in revenue over the life of the franchise agreement. 
•
Interest Income - like Initial Franchise Fees, interest income is a Cost Recovery Revenue stream that reimburses the Company for those franchises on a payment plan. Interest income is recognized over the term of the franchise fee payment plan. 
Ancillary Revenue: 
•
Contingent Commissions - although high margin, Contingent Commissions are unpredictable and susceptible to weather events and Carrier underwriting results. Management does not rely on Contingent Commissions for operating cash flow or budget planning.
•
Other Income - book transfer fees, marketing investments from Carriers and other items that are unpredictable and supplemental to other revenue streams.

(2) Renewal Royalty Fees, New Business Royalty Fees, Initial Franchise Fees, and Other Income are included in "Franchise revenues" as shown on the Consolidated statements of operations.
Core Revenue:
The Company's primary source of revenue is through the placement of insurance policies. We are paid a percentage of the premium from the Carriers in the form of New Business Commissions and, in states which allow it, we charge Agency Fees for the placement of the policy. For policies placed through franchise sales, we receive 20% of the commissions and fees received as New Business Royalties during the first term of the policy. All clients are serviced by our world-class service centers, allowing for predictable retention of our Book of Business, which has historically been 84%. All commissions received in corporate sales after the first term of the policy are recognized as Renewal Commissions, which are higher margin due to lower commissions and servicing costs. For all policies that renew related to franchise sales, we receive as Renewal Royalty Fees 50% of the commissions received from the Carrier, creating a mechanical increase in revenue of 150% in the first renewal term. Renewal Royalty Fees are higher margin compared to New Business Royalty Fees due to lower servicing costs on higher revenue. Because of the lower royalty fees on New Business Commissions as compared to Renewal Commissions, and because we are placing an increasing percentage of Total Written Premium in franchise sales, Core Revenue growth will lag that of Total Written Premium.
53
Cost Recovery Revenue:
The Company charges every franchise an Initial Franchise Fee, which, on a cash flow basis, covers our costs to recruit, train, onboard, and support the franchise for the first year. The Initial Franchise Fee is determined by the state of the Franchise location and the payment terms. The Company recognizes revenue over the 10-year life of the contract. If the franchise elects the payment plan, the difference between the pay-in-full and the payment plan amounts is recognized as Interest Income using the interest rate method over the 5-year term of the payment plan.
Ancillary Revenue:
With certain Carriers, the Company has the opportunity to earn additional revenue in the form of Contingent Commissions, typically based on the volume, growth, and loss ratio of the business placed with the select Carriers. The Contingent Commissions are extremely difficult to predict in any given period and can vary greatly from year to year. Although the Company can control the amount of business placed with the Carriers, loss ratios depend on many factors that are outside of our control, such as weather events and Carrier underwriting accuracy. The Company estimates the amount to be received during the period over which the Contingent Commissions are earned. 
Below is a summary showing the historical Contingent Commissions as a percentage of Total Written Premiums Placed for the period in which the Contingent Commissions were earned (in thousands).

Contingent Commissions can vary significantly from year-to-year and should be viewed over several years. Since 2022, revenue from Contingent Commissions have historically represented approximately 0.54% of Total Written Premium at year-end. Most of our Contingent Commissions are earned in the year prior to when they are received. For the year ended December 31, 2022, $7.7 million of Contingent Commissions were earned (below our historical average as a percentage of premium), of which $7.4 million was still receivable at December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, $13.7 million of Contingent Commissions were earned (below our historical average as a percentage of premium), of which $6.9 million was still receivable at December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2024, $31.4 million of Contingent Commissions were earned (above our historical average as a percentage of premium), of which $25.5 million was still receivable at December 31, 2024.
Premium by line of business
We are a distributor of insurance policies in a range of primarily personal lines of business including homeowner’s insurance; automotive insurance; dwelling property insurance; flood, wind and earthquake insurance; excess liability or umbrella insurance; specialty lines insurance (motorcycle, recreational vehicle, and other insurance); commercial lines insurance (general liability, property and auto insurance for small businesses) and life insurance.

Expenses
Due to our organic-focused growth strategy, virtually all of our investments in future growth are in people and technology. The majority of our investments are not capitalizable and are recognized immediately on our statement of operations, while investments in software are capitalized as intangible assets and recognized as expense over the useful life of the software.
Employee compensation and benefits.
 Employee compensation and benefits is our largest expense and consists of (a) base compensation comprising salary, bonuses and benefits paid and payable to employees, and (b) stock option awards for our senior employees. We expect to continue to experience a general rise in compensation and benefits expense commensurate with expected growth in headcount and with the need to maintain competitive compensation levels as we expand geographically and create new products and services.
General and administrative expenses.
 General and administrative expenses include technology, travel, accounting, legal and other professional fees, placement fees, office expenses, depreciation and other costs associated with our operations. Our occupancy-related costs and professional services expenses, in particular, generally increase or decrease in relative proportion to the number of our employees and the overall size and scale of our business operations.
Key performance indicators
Our key operating metrics are discussed below:
Total Written Premium
Total Written Premium represents the total amount of current (non-cancelled) gross premium that is placed with Goosehead’s portfolio of Carriers for a reporting period. We believe that Total Written Premium is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it reflects growth of our business relative to other insurance agencies.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we had $3.8 billion in Total Written Premium, representing a 29% increase, compared to $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The following table shows Total Written Premium by channel for the years ended 2024

Policies in Force
Policies in Force means the total count of current (non-cancelled) policies placed with Goosehead’s portfolio of Carriers as of a reported date. We believe that Policies in Force is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it reflects growth of our business relative to other insurance agencies.
As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,674,000 Policies in Force compared to 1,486,000 as of December 31, 2023, representing a 13% increase.
NPS
Net Promoter Score (NPS) is calculated based on a single question: “How likely are you to refer Goosehead Insurance to a friend, family member or colleague?” Clients that respond with a 6 or below are Detractors, with a 7 or 8 are Passives, and with a 9 or 10 are Promoters. NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. For example, if 50% of respondents were Promoters and 10% were Detractors, NPS is a 40. NPS is a useful gauge of the loyalty of client relationships and can be compared across companies and industries.
NPS has decreased modestly to 89 as of December 31, 2024 from 92 at December 31, 2023, primarily driven by rapid premium increases offset by our service team's consistent delivery.
55
Client Retention
Client Retention is calculated by comparing the number of all clients that had at least one policy in force twelve months prior to the date of measurement and still have at least one policy in force at the date of measurement. We believe Client Retention is useful as a measure of how well Goosehead retains clients year-over-year and minimizes defections.
Client Retention decreased modestly to 84% at December 31, 2024 when compared to 86% at December 31, 2023, impacted modestly by premium rate increases yet supported by the service team’s continued focus on delivering highly differentiated service levels. Our retention rate is even stronger on a premium basis, driven from increases in premium taken by our Carriers and additional coverages sold by our sales agents. In 2024, we retained 98% of the premiums we distributed in 2023, a decrease from premium retention in 2023 of 101%.
New Business Revenue
New Business Revenue is commissions received from the Carrier, Agency Fees received from clients, and Royalty Fees relating to policies in their first term.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, New Business Revenue grew 9% to $59.9 million, from $54.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Growth in New Business Revenue is primarily attributable to increases in the number of sales agents, increased New Business Production per Agency, and rising premium rates.
Any diminished capacity of Carriers to place new business (including as a result of the recent wildfires in Southern California and hurricanes in Florida) could slow the growth of our New Business Revenue in the future.
Renewal Revenue
Renewal Revenue is commissions received from the Carrier and Royalty Fees from franchises after the first term of a policy.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, Renewal Revenue grew 20% to $213.9 million, from $178.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Growth in Renewal Revenue was driven primarily by Client Retention of 84% at December 31, 2024, and premium rate increases over the prior year. As our agent force matures, the policies they wrote in prior years begin to convert from New Business Revenue to more profitable Renewal Revenue.
Continued declines in client retention caused by increases in premium rates could slow the growth of our Renewal Revenue in the future.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, Ancillary Revenue,  Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted EPS are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered substitutes for total revenue, net income, net income margin or earnings per share, which we consider to be the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We refer to these measures as "non-GAAP financial measures." We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures, tax position, depreciation, amortization and certain other items that we believe are not representative of our core business. Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, Ancillary Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted EPS have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, Ancillary Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, or Adjusted EPS in isolation or as substitutes for net income, earnings per share or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, Ancillary Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
Core Revenue
Core Revenue is a supplemental measure of our performance and includes Renewal Commissions, Renewal Royalty Fees, New Business Commissions, New Business Royalty Fees, and Agency Fees. We believe that Core Revenue is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it summarizes all of our revenues from sales of individual insurance policies. 
Core Revenue increased by $40.7 million, or 17%, to $273.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $233.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The primary drivers of the increase from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 are more new policies written driven by increases in the number of sales agents and 
56
increased New Business Production per Agency, an increase in policies in the renewal term assisted by client retention of 84%, and rising premium rates.
Cost Recovery Revenue
Cost Recovery Revenue is a supplemental measure of our performance and includes Initial Franchise Fees and Interest Income. We believe that Cost Recovery Revenue is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it summarizes revenues that are viewed by management as cost recovery mechanisms.
Cost Recovery Revenue decreased by $5.1 million, or 40%, to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The primary driver of the decrease was a decrease in terminations of franchises, which resulted in less accelerated recognition of initial franchise fee revenue.
Ancillary Revenue
Ancillary Revenue is a supplemental measure of our performance and includes Contingent Commissions and Other Income. We believe that Ancillary Revenue is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it summarizes revenues that are ancillary to our core business.
Ancillary Revenue increased by $17.6 million, or 113%, to $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The primary drivers of the increase from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 were improved loss ratios as well as growth in Total Written Premiums leading to attaining higher Contingent Commissions.
Contingent Commissions are inherently volatile as they are based on carrier underwriting profitability and may be impacted by catastrophic losses resulting from natural or man-made disasters.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of items that do not relate to underlying business performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude equity-based compensation, impairment expense, and other non-operating items, including, among other things, certain non-cash charges and certain non-recurring or non-operating gains or losses.
Adjusted EBITDA increased by $30.1 million, or 43%, to $99.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $69.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by a 17% increase in Core Revenue with slower growth of 13%

in employee compensation and benefits excluding equity-based compensation and of 14% in general and administrative expenses excluding impairment as well as a $17.6 million increase in high-margin Contingent Commissions.
Adjusted EBITDA Margin
Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA as defined above, divided by total revenue excluding other non-operating items. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is helpful in measuring profitability of operations on a consolidated level.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 32% compared to 27% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Adjusted EBITDA margin increase came from a 17% increase in Core Revenue with slower growth of 13%

in employee compensation and benefits excluding equity-based compensation and of 14% in general and administrative expenses excluding impairment as well as a $17.6 million increase in high-margin Contingent Commissions.
Adjusted EPS
Adjusted EPS is a supplemental measure of our performance, defined as earnings per share (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before non-recurring or non-operating income and expenses, adjusted to assume a single class of stock (Class A) and assuming noncontrolling interest does not exist. Adjusted EPS is a useful measure to management because it eliminates the impact of items that do not relate to business performance and helps compare companies that may not have a dual-share class structure.
Adjusted EPS increased by $0.66 to $1.99 for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $1.33 for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by a significant increase in income from operations driven by strong growth in Core Revenue and Contingent Commissions with slower growth in operating expenses and the repurchase of 1,045 thousand Class A shares as part of our share repurchase program.
