Capital Deployment Priorities, Dividend Policy and Repurchase and Redemption Program
We have returned $557.1 million to shareholders through share repurchases and redemptions and we paid dividends and distributions of $214.5 million over the past three years. We expect to continue returning capital to shareholders.
Since 2022, the Board has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share. In addition, Newmark Holdings has paid quarterly after-tax distributions to its partners. The Exchange Ratio is adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement due to any difference between our dividend policy and the distribution policy of Newmark Holdings.
Any dividends, if and when declared by our Board, will be paid on a quarterly basis. No assurance can be made, however, that a dividend will be paid each quarter. The declaration, payment, timing, and amount of any future dividends payable by us will be at the sole discretion of our Board. With respect to any distributions which are declared, amounts paid to or on behalf of partners will at least cover their related tax payments. Whether any given post-tax amount is equivalent to the amount received by a stockholder also on an after-tax basis depends upon stockholders’ and partners’ domiciles and tax status. 
We are a holding company, with no direct operations, and therefore we are able to pay dividends only from our available cash on hand and funds received from distributions from Newmark OpCo. Our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by regulatory considerations as well as by covenants contained in financing or other agreements. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends may be payable only out of surplus, which is our net assets minus our capital (as defined under Delaware law), or, if we have no surplus, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Accordingly, any unanticipated accounting, tax, regulatory or other charges against net income may adversely affect our ability to declare and pay dividends. While we intend to declare and pay dividends quarterly, there can be no assurance that our Board will declare dividends at all or on a regular basis or that the amount of our dividends will not change.
Stock and Unit Repurchase and Redemption Program and 2024 Activity
On November 4, 2024, Newmark’s Board increased Newmark’s existing share repurchase and unit purchase authorization, which has no expiration date, to $400.0 million. This authorization includes repurchases of shares or purchases of units from executive officers, other employees and partners, including of BGC and Cantor, as well as other affiliated persons or entities. From time to time, Newmark may actively continue to repurchase shares and/or purchase units.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, Newmark repurchased 17,729,096 shares of Class A common stock and 863,722 units at an average price of $11.99 and $14.24 per security, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, Newmark repurchased 5,785,370 shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $6.47 per share.
As of December 31, 2024, Newmark had $371.9 million remaining under its share repurchase and unit purchase authorization.

Performance Graph
The performance graph below shows a comparison of the cumulative total stockholder return, on a gross dividend reinvestment basis, of $100 invested on December 31, 2019, measured on December 31 of each year from 2019 through 2024. The peer group consists of CBRE Group, Inc., Colliers International Group Inc., Cushman & Wakefield plc, Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated, and Savills plc. The returns of the peer group companies have been weighted according to their U.S. dollar stock market capitalization for purposes of arriving at a peer group average. The chart includes the Russell 2000 Index, of which we are a member. Because this index includes small cap U.S.-listed companies, and because we are not a part of the S&P 500 Index, we believe that the Russell 2000 Index is a better measure of our stock’s relative performance.

The foregoing risks and uncertainties, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed under the headings “Item 1A—Risk Factors,” and “Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, may cause actual results and events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
Overview 
Newmark is a leading commercial real estate advisor and service provider to large institutional investors, global corporations, and other owners and occupiers. We offer a diverse array of integrated services and products designed to meet the full needs of our clients. Please see “Item 1—Business” for more information.
Business Environment 
There are several factors that impact results across our three main revenue sources (management services, servicing fees and other; leasing and other commissions; and capital markets), including both secular and cyclical industry trends as well as macroeconomic dynamics and our investments in growth. These factors are discussed below.
65
Key Business Drivers
The key divers of our business include our ability to attract and retain revenue generating headcount across our service lines, the productivity of these employees, and industry volumes in these areas. Volumes are largely a factor of economic growth, interest rates, and the demand for commercial real estate as an investment and debt financing. In addition, demand for our services is influenced by secular trends with respect to outsourcing and other services we provide. 
Attracting and Retaining Revenue-generating Headcount. 
During 2024, we continued to solidify what we believe is our position as the platform of choice for many of the real estate industry’s top professionals. In U.S. and U.K., we hired some of the most prolific and experienced debt and structured finance professionals as well as some of the most innovative and active leasing teams. Newmark also opened a flagship office in France, continental Europe’s second largest transaction market, where we attracted some of the most talented leasing and capital markets professionals. In October of 2024, our European expansion continued with the launch of our capital markets and leasing businesses in Germany. We believe that these additions further demonstrate the strength of our global brand, and that our substantial investments in data, analytics, and talent position Newmark to capitalize on ongoing macroeconomic trends. Furthermore, our revenue-generating headcount was up modestly year-on-year as of the end of the 2024, after having been relatively flat year-on-year at the end of each of the three previous quarters. Therefore, productivity gains drove the large majority of our total revenue growth, as well as our increased fees across Capital Markets, Leasing, and Valuation & Advisory. As more of our recently hired revenue-generating professionals ramp up, we expect further productivity gains over time.
Continued Trends in Outsourcing and with Respect to Our Servicing Portfolio. 
Our GCS, Property Management  and servicing and asset management businesses continue to benefit from increased outsourcing by companies, owners of real estate, and lenders. We expect the outsourcing trend for commercial real estate and lending functions to continue. This trend, combined with our ability to cross sell between our service lines, enabled us grow our management services and servicing businesses by double digit percentages in 2024. 
Additionally, we operate a high growth asset management and servicing business focused on bank, fund, and commercial mortgage-backed securities clients, including GSE/FHA lenders. As of December 31, 2024, our loan servicing and asset management portfolio was $183.4 billion (of which 61.8% was limited servicing and asset management, 36.8% was higher margin primary servicing, and 1.5% was special servicing). We expect our overall portfolio to continue providing a steady stream of income and cash flow over the life of the serviced loans.
Trends in GDP and Job Growth 
Commercial real estate leasing activity has historically been positively correlated with job creation, particularly with respect to office-based employment, and GDP growth.
According to Bloomberg, U.S. and U.K. GDP expanded by 2.8% and 0.9%, respectively, in 2024. In 2023, the respective growth rates were 2.9% and 0.4%. For context, over the ten years prior to the global pandemic (or through December 31, 2019), real U.S. GDP grew at a CAGR of 2.4%, measured in chain linked 2017 dollars, while real U.K. GDP grew at a CAGR of 2.0%, measured in chain linked 2019 pounds.
According to Bloomberg, the seasonally adjusted monthly average of U.S. non-farm payroll employment increased by approximately 377,000, 251,000, and 186,000 in 2022, 2023, and 2024 respectively. For context, this seasonally adjusted monthly figure averaged approximately 183,000 
over the ten years prior to the global pandemic (or through December 31, 2019)
. The December 2024 U.S. unemployment rate (based on U-3) was 4.1% compared with 3.8% a year earlier. With respect to the U.K., the  unemployment rate was 4.1%, and 4.3% in 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
Interest Rate Environment.
 Commercial real estate capital markets transactions involving financing generally utilize medium- or long-term debt, and the interest rates for such debt tend to correlate with movements in benchmark rates with similar tenors, including U.S. Treasuries. Such benchmark rates can be meaningfully impacted by movements in key short-term rates, such as the Fed Funds Target rate. Sudden increases in short term interest rates can therefore have pronounced effects on commercial mortgage origination and investment sales volumes. 
The ten-year U.S. Treasury yield increased by approximately 79 basis points quarter on quarter and by 69 basis points year-on-year to 4.6% as of December 31, 2024. The ten-year U.K. Gilt yield increased by approximately 57 basis points quarter on quarter and by 103 basis points year-on-year to 4.6% as of December 31, 2024. These increases were due largely to uncertainty with respect to the pace at which inflation in the U.S. and U.K. will subside and at which the FOMC and/or MPC will lower short term rates. For context, ten-year U.S. Treasury and ten-year Gilt yields still remain below their 50-year average through December 31, 2024 of approximately 5.9% and 6.8%, respectively. 
While U.S. and U.K. inflation measures have declined since 2022, they remain above the 2% targets set by both the FOMC and MPC. As a result, 
shor
t-term yields are expected to be higher compared with most of the period from the end of 2008 through early 2022, they are expected to stabilize and gradually fall from more recent levels. For example, the February 
66
2025 Bloomberg consensus was for Fed Funds Target rate target rate to be 4.1% and 3.7%, respectively, by the ends of 2025 and 2026. The most recent Bloomberg consensus was for the Bank of England’s short-term target rate to be 3.8%, and 3.4%, by the ends of 2025 and 2026. For context, the upper bound of the Fed Funds Target rate averaged 0.64% from December 31, 2008 (near the height of the global financial crises) through February 28, 2022 (when the FOMC began raising this rate), and averaged approximately 4.9% and 3.1% over the 50 years and 25 years ended December 31, 2022, respectively, according to Bloomberg. The Official Bank Rate averaged 0.47% from December 31, 2008 through February 28, 2022, and approximately 2.4% and 6.3% over the 25 and 50 years ended December 31, 2024, according to Bloomberg. 
Industry Leasing Activity. 
While industrial and retail have increased as a percentage of leasing revenues since 2019, office remains the majority of activity for Newmark and the industry. According to data from Newmark Research and CoStar, U.S. office leasing activity, as measured by the percentage of available inventory leased in a given quarter, has improved significantly from the lows seen in the first half of 2021, but remains somewhat below the 2015-2019 average, largely as a result of smaller lease sizes versus pre-pandemic levels. According to Newmark Research, this recovery in office leasing was particularly strong in New York City and other gateway cities and has not yet spread to many of the other regions and cities in the U.S. Based on Newmark Research and CoStar data, demand for Trophy and Class A U.K. office spaces is robust, particularly in central London. They also estimate that fourth quarter 2024 overall U.K. office leasing activity was up by over 20% year-on-year its highest level since the third quarter of 2018, while full year 2024 activity increased by over 10% versus 2023 and was the best year since 2019.
Based on data from Newmark Research and CoStar, the scarcity of available U.S. retail space cannot satisfy strong demand, which has dampened leasing activity for this property type but kept vacancies near all-time lows and rents near their historical highs. According to the same sources, while industrial net absorption remained positive in the U.S., it has turned negative in the U.K. In both countries, vacancy continued to increase in 2024 as a result of an increased supply, as a higher-than-normal pipeline of available space is being constructed. Against this backdrop, our revenues from Leasing and other commissions increased by 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
We expect demand for office space to be driven by the reset in values due to near-term debt maturities. We also continue to see increased need for office space in certain markets, led by ongoing return-to-work plans, as well as new demand driven by companies in technology including AI as well as financial services. Placer.ai data for December 2024 indicates that in-person attendance in the U.S. increased to 66% of pre-pandemic levels versus 63% a year earlier. Our management services, leasing, origination, and capital markets professionals continue to actively collaborate with clients to repurpose underutilized spaces and assets, including with respect to conversion of obsolete office or retail properties.
Industry Capital Markets Activity.
 We continued to gain share in Capital Markets, even as overall industry volumes improved due largely to the stabilization of benchmark interest rates. For example, MSCI’s preliminary investment sales figures, which excludes transactions related to the equity portion of loan sales, indicate that volumes across all property types were up by at least 40% and 9%, respectively, in U.S. in the fourth quarter and full year 2024 compared with a year earlier. The same source reports that European investment sales volumes increased by at least 11% and 4% for the same respective periods. Newmark’s fourth and full year 2024 investment sales volumes were up by approximately 71% and 18%, respectively, excluding the impact of the Signature Transactions. We have gained considerable market share over the past several years. For example, our U.S. investment sales volumes were approximately 9% of overall U.S. MSCI volumes over the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, versus 3.3% in 2015. 
We have also gained market share in our commercial mortgage origination businesses. According to the MBA,
 which also excludes loan sales, 
overall U.S. commercial and multifamily originations increased by 84% and 17% in the fourth quarter and full year 2024, respectively versus a year earlier. In comparison, we increased our Total Debt volumes year-on-year for fourth quarter and full year 2024 by
 approximately 177% and 79%, respectively, excluding the impact of the Signature Transactions. 
We believe that we have meaningfully outperformed the industry in originations over the last several years. According to data or estimates from MSCI, the MBA, and/or Newmark Research, our U.S. Total Debt volumes were nearly 9% of U.S. commercial and multifamily mortgage originations over the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, compared with 1.5% in 2015.
67
Commercial And Multifamily Mortgage Maturities and Other Drivers.
 In 2024, we benefited

from the continuing need for our clients to both refinance existing properties owned by them and to finance investments in properties they seek to own. We expect the record amounts of medium-term commercial and multifamily mortgage maturities and interest rate stabilization to together lead to continued improvement in industry debt volumes, as well as increased investment sales activity. For example, the MBA expects a record $957 billion of U.S. mortgage maturities in 2025 alone, and approximately $2.1 trillion between 2025 and 2027.
In addition, we anticipate several positive factors will position the Company for success, including the ongoing strength and expected capital investment in the U.S. economy, the re-shoring of manufacturing and investment in data centers fueled by artificial intelligence. We believe that these factors, along with our leading presence in capital markets, will drive growth across nearly all of Newmark’s service lines. 
Financial Overview
Revenues

We generally derive revenues from the following three sources:
•
Management Services, Servicing Fees and Other
. We provide commercial services to tenants and landlords. In this business, we provide property and facilities management services along with project management, V&A services, and other consulting services, as well as technology services, to customers who may also utilize our commercial real estate brokerage services, and flexible workspace solutions. Servicing fees are derived from the servicing of loans originated by us as well as loans originated by third parties.
•
Leasing and Other Commissions
. We offer a diverse range of commercial real estate brokerage and advisory services, including tenant and landlord (or agency) representation, which includes comprehensive lease negotiations, strategic planning, site selection, lease auditing, and other financial and market analysis.
•
Capital Markets. 
This consists of investment sales and commercial mortgage origination, net. Our investment sales business specializes in the arrangement of acquisitions and dispositions of commercial properties, as well as equity placement and other related services. Our commercial mortgage origination, net business offers services and products to facilitate debt financing for our clients and customers. Commercial mortgage origination revenue is comprised of commissions generated from mortgage brokerage and debt placement services, as well as the origination fees and premiums derived from the origination of GSE/FHA loans with borrowers. Our commercial mortgage origination revenue also includes the revenue recognized for the fair value of expected net future cash flows from servicing recognized at commitment.
Fees are generally earned when a lease is signed. In many cases, landlords are responsible for paying the fees. In capital markets, fees are earned and recognized when the sale of a property closes, and title passes from seller to buyer for investment sales and when debt or equity is funded to a vehicle for debt and equity transactions. Loan originations related fees and sales premiums, net, are recognized when a derivative asset is recorded upon the commitment to originate a loan with a borrower and sell the loan to an investor. The derivative is recorded at fair value and includes loan origination fees, sales premiums and the estimated fair value of the expected net servicing cash flows. Loan originations related fees and sales premiums, net, are recognized net of related fees and commissions to affiliates or third-party brokers. For loans we broker, revenues are recognized when the loan is closed.
Servicing fees are recognized on an accrual basis over the lives of the related mortgage loans. We typically receive monthly management fees based upon a percentage of monthly rental income generated from the property under management, or in some cases, the greater of such percentage or a minimum agreed upon fee. We are often reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs, as well as certain out-of-pocket expenses, directly attributable to properties under management. We follow U.S. GAAP, which provides guidance when accounting for reimbursements from clients and when accounting for certain contingent events for leasing and capital markets transactions. See Note 3 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion.
Expenses
(i) Compensation and Employee Benefits

The majority of our operating costs consist of cash and non-cash compensation expenses, which include base salaries, producer commissions based on production, forgivable loans for term contracts, discretionary and other bonuses and all related employee benefits and taxes. Our employees consist of commissioned producers, executives and other administrative support. Our producers are largely compensated based on the revenue they generate for the firm, keeping these costs variable in nature.
68
As part of our compensation plans, certain employees have been granted limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and, prior to the Newmark IPO, BGC Holdings, which generally receive quarterly allocations of net income and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As a result of the Corporate Conversion, there are no longer any limited partnership units in BGC Holdings outstanding. Certain Newmark employees also hold N Units that do not participate in quarterly partnership distributions and are not allocated any items of profit or loss. These N Units convert into distribution earnings units over a three- to ten-year period. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income on such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Newmark has granted certain conversion rights on limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and, prior to the Corporate Conversion, then-outstanding limited partnership units in BGC Holdings, to Newmark employees to convert the limited partnership units to a capital balance within Newmark Holdings or BGC Holdings. Generally, such units are not considered share-equivalent limited partnership units and are not in the fully diluted share count. 
Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that we record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations as part of “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.” The liability for limited partnership units with a post-termination payout amount is included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Certain limited partnership units are granted exchangeability into Class A common stock or may be redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of Class A common stock. At the time exchangeability is granted, or the shares are issued, Newmark recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Certain of our employees have been awarded Preferred Units in Newmark Holdings and, prior to the Corporate Conversion, BGC Holdings. Each quarter, the net profits of Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings are or were allocated to such units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation, which is deducted before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units in Newmark Holdings. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into our Class A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they are not included in our fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are also reflected in compensation expense under “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. After deduction of the Preferred Distribution, the remaining partnership units generally receive quarterly allocation of net income based on their weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. In addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain limited partnership units, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder upon such exchange. This is an acceptable alternative to the common practice among public companies of issuing the gross number of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes. 
We have also entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans, which may be either wholly or in part repaid from the distribution earnings that the individual receives on their limited partnership interests or from the proceeds of the sales of the employees’ shares of our Class A common stock. The forgivable portion of these loans is recognized as compensation expense over the service period.
From time to time, we may also enter into agreements with employees and partners to grant bonus and salary advances or other types of loans. These advances and loans are repayable in the timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. In addition, we also enter into deferred compensation agreements with employees providing services to us. The costs associated with such plans are generally amortized over the period in which they vest. (See Note 27 — “Compensation” and Note 28 — “Commitments and Contingencies” to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
(ii) Other Operating Expenses
We have various other operating expenses. We incur leasing, equipment and maintenance expenses. We also incur selling and promotion expenses, which include entertainment, marketing and travel-related expenses. We incur communication 
69
expenses, professional and consulting fees for legal, audit and other special projects, and interest expense related to short-term operational funding needs, and notes payable and collateralized borrowings.
We pay fees to Cantor for performing certain administrative and other support, including charges for occupancy of office space, utilization of fixed assets and accounting, operations, human resources, legal services and technology infrastructure support. Management believes that these charges are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services rendered. However, the expenses for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if we had not obtained these services from Cantor. In addition, these charges may not reflect the costs of services we may receive from Cantor in the future.
(iii) Other Income (loss), Net
Other income (loss), net is comprised of gains (losses) on equity method investments which represent our pro rata share of the net gains (losses) on investments over which we have significant influence but which we do not control, and the mark-to-market gains or losses on marketable and non-marketable investments.
(iv) Provision for Income Taxes
We incur income tax expenses based on the location, legal structure, and jurisdictional taxing authorities of each of our subsidiaries. Certain of the Company’s entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to primarily the UBT in New York City. U.S. federal and state income tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss, with the exception of the UBT, rests with the partners rather than the partnership entity (see Note 2 — “Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings” to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our accompanying consolidated financial statements include U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on Newmark’s allocable share of the U.S. results of operations. Outside of the U.S., we operate principally through subsidiary corporations subject to local income taxes.
Newmark is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. The OECD Pillar Two Framework provides for a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. The EU Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive with a subset of rules that became effective January 1, 2024. Other countries are also expected to implement similar legislation. The minimum global effective tax did not have a material impact on our 2024 tax rate.
Business Mix and Seasonality
Our pre-tax margins are affected by the mix of revenues generated. For example, servicing revenues tend to have higher pre-tax margins than Newmark as a whole, and margins from originating GSE/FHA loans, which are included in “Capital markets” in our consolidated statement of operations, tend to be lower, as we retain rights to service loans over time, and because this item includes non-cash GAAP gains attributable to OMSRs, which represent the fair value of expected net future cash flows from servicing recognized at commitment, net. Capital markets transactions tend to have higher pre-tax margins than leasing transactions. Pre-tax earnings margins on our property management and parts of our other GCS businesses are at the lower end of margins for the Company as a whole because they include some revenues that equal their related expenses. These revenues represent fully reimbursable compensation and non-compensation costs and may be referred to as “pass through revenues.” 
Due to the strong desire of many market participants to close real estate transactions prior to the end of a calendar year, our business exhibits certain seasonality, with our revenue tending to be lowest in the first quarter and strongest in the fourth quarter. For the five years from 2020 through 2024, we generated an average of approximately 21% of our revenues in the first quarter and 30% of our revenues in the fourth quarter. Because approximately 30% of our expenses are fixed in a typical year, this seasonality generally leads to higher profitability in the fourth quarter and lower margins in the first quarter, all else equal.

Revenues and expenses recorded during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2024 included in this report differ from those included in our earnings release issued February 14, 2025. This reflected a $15.6 million reduction in reported Management services, servicing fees and other revenues, which related to pass through revenues, and an offsetting $15.6 million reduction in the related reported pass through Operating, administrative and other expense. These offsetting items had no impact on the Company’s earnings.

Year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023
Revenues
Management Services, Servicing Fees and Other
Management services, servicing fees and other revenue increased by $135.8 million, or 14.0%, to $1,106.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase reflects growth from GCS, our servicing and asset management business, as well as V&A fees.
71
Leasing and Other Commissions
Leasing and other commission revenues increased by $18.0 million, or 2.1%, to $857.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 which was driven primarily by growth in office leasing.
Capital Markets
Capital markets increased by $114.3 million, or 17.3%, to $774.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase reflects a 30.4% increase in commercial mortgage origination, net, and a 9.5% improvement in investment sales fees, both of which reflected strength across every major property type. 
Expenses
Compensation and Employee Benefits
Compensation and employee benefits expense increased by $109.3 million, or 7.3%, to $1,598.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase reflects higher commission-based revenues and other costs related to acquisitions and the hiring of revenue generating professionals.
Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs
Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs increased by $45.7 million, or 32.7%, to $185.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to the year-on-year improvement in Newmark’s average stock price as compensation expense related to the grant of exchangeability for limited partnership units is related to the stock price of Newmark Class A common stock.
Operating, Administrative and Other
Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $60.9 million, or 11.3%, to $597.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 due to higher pass through costs and increased warehouse interest expense, both of which were offset by associated revenues.
Fees to Related Parties
Fees to related parties decreased by $0.8 million, or 2.8%, to $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by $8.1 million, or 4.9%, to $174.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 due to increased fixed asset depreciation of $0.5 million, intangible asset amortization of $2.8 million, as well as a $4.4 million change in MSR valuation allowance.
Other Income (loss), Net
Other income (loss), net of $6.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted primarily of recoveries from forfeited restricted Newmark Class A common stock.
Other income (loss), net of $13.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of equity income on the Real Estate LP joint venture described below under “—Certain Related Party Transactions—Investment in CF Real Estate Finance Holdings, L.P.” and proceeds from a legal settlement, partially offset by losses on certain investments.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net increased by $10.0 million, or 46.1%, to $31.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to higher interest expense on our corporate debt.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes increased by $4.7 million, or 11.4%, to $45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. In general, our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the level, geographic and business mix of our earnings.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $4.5 million, or 22.5%, to $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a higher pre-tax income.

Year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022
Revenues
Management Services, Servicing Fees and Other
Management services, servicing fees and other revenue increased by $61.4 million, or 6.8%, to $970.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The growth reflected 
the addition of Gerald Eve, as well as property management and GCS increasing their combined square footage under management by approximately 26% year-on-year. Additionally, Newmark more than doubled the size of its overall servicing and asset management portfolio to 
$175.9 
billion over the same period, which included an approximately
 11% e
xpansion of the Company’s high margin primary servicing portfolio. These increases were partially offset by declines in our U.S. V&A business.
Leasing and Other Commissions
Leasing and other commissions revenues increased by $7.7 million, or 0.9%, to $839.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The improvement was driven by growth in industrial and retail. 
Capital Markets
Capital markets decreased by $304.3 million, or 31.6%, to $659.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower industry-wide commercial and multifamily origination volumes, which declined by 47% in the U.S. (according to the MBA). 
The Company’s GSE/FHA origination platform also gained significant market share, as its volumes declined by approximately
 9%
 versus
 29% r
eductions in industry GSE multifamily activity. Investment sales revenue decreased by 
37.1%,
 which
 primarily compares to industry-wide declines of approximately 50% for U.S. and European investment sales over the same period (according to MSCI).
Expenses
Compensation and Employee Benefits
Compensation and employee benefits expense decreased by $65.6 million, or 4.2%, to $1,489.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was due to lower variable compensation related to commission-based revenues and our cost saving initiatives, partially offset by acquisitions and the addition of new revenue-generating professionals.
Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs
Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs increased by $1.4 million, or 1.0%, to $139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.
Operating, Administrative and Other
Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $1.9 million, or 0.3%, to $536.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due primarily to operational expenses related to acquisitions, largely offset by cost saving initiatives.
Fees to Related Parties
Fees to related parties decreased by $1.3 million, or 4.6%, to $27.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $0.4 million, or 0.2%, to $166.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.
Other Income (loss), Net
Other income (loss), net of $13.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of equity income on the Real Estate LP joint venture and proceeds from a legal settlement, partially offset by losses on certain investments.
Other loss of $97.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to $87.5 million realized and unrealized losses from the sale of Nasdaq shares and $12.9 million of mark-to-market losses on non-marketable investments.
Interest Expense, Net
73
Interest expense, net decreased by $9.2 million, or 29.8%, to $21.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due to an increase in interest income on employee loans, which was largely offset by increased amortization which is recorded as part of compensation expense.
Provision for Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes decreased by $1.0 million, or 2.3%, to $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by lower pre-tax earnings. In general, our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by $9.5 million, or 32.4% to $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by lower pre-tax earnings.
Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview
The primary sources of liquidity for our business are the cash on our balance sheet, cash flow provided by operations, and the $600.0 million revolving Credit Facility.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, our expansion into other markets, our acquisitions of other companies and hiring of teams of producers, and our results of operations. To the extent that existing cash, cash from operations and credit facilities are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public equity or debt financing. As of December 31, 2024, our debt consisted of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.500% Senior Notes with a carrying amount of $595.7 million and $75.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility with a carrying amount of $75.0 million, in each case exclusive of our warehouse facilities described under “—Warehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises.” 
Financial Position
Total assets were $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2024 and $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
Total liabilities were $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2024 and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
Liquidity
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $197.7 million. Additionally, we had $525.0 million available under our committed senior unsecured revolving Credit Facility. We expect to generate cash flows from operations to fund our business and use those funds, and our Credit Facility, to meet our short-term liquidity requirements, which we define as those arising within the next twelve months, and our long-term liquidity requirements, which we define as those beyond the next twelve months.
Debt
The carrying value of our debt, excluding our warehouse facilities, consisted of the following as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement 
On August 10, 2023, Newmark entered into a Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement, by and among the Company, the several financial institutions from time to time party thereto, as Lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (as such terms are defined in the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement), pursuant to which the Lenders committed to provide to the Company a senior unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $420.0 million, which could be increased, subject to certain terms and conditions, to up to $550.0 million. The proceeds of 
74
the Delayed Draw Term Loan could only be used to repay the 6.125% Senior Notes at their maturity. The Delayed Draw Term Loan had a maturity date of November 14, 2026.
As set forth in the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Delayed Draw Term Loan could bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either (a) Term SOFR for interest periods of one or three months (as selected by the Company) or upon the consent of all Lenders, such other period that is 12 months or less (in each case, subject to availability), as selected by the Company, plus an applicable margin or (b) a base rate equal to the greatest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate as established by the Administrative Agent, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin. Upon funding, the applicable margin was 2.625% with respect to Term SOFR borrowings in (a) above and 1.625% with respect to base rate borrowings in (b) above. Depending on the Company’s credit ratings, the applicable margin could range, with respect to Term SOFR borrowings, from 2.125% to 3.375% through and including August 10, 2024, and 2.5% to 3.875% thereafter; and base rate borrowings, from 1.125% to 2.375% through and including August 10, 2024, and 1.5% to 2.875% thereafter. 
The Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement contained financial covenants with respect to minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratio. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement also contained certain other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The covenants in the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement were consistent with those within the Company’s existing $600.0 million Credit Facility, which matures on April 26, 2027 and remains available to the Company. 
On November 8, 2023, Newmark provided notice to Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, to borrow the $420.0 million available under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement with the funds made available on November 14, 2023. The Company used the $420.0 million of proceeds of the Delayed Draw Term Loan draw to pay a portion of the matured principal and interest of the Company’s $550.0 million 6.125% Senior Notes due November 15, 2023. On January 12, 2024, the outstanding balance under the Delayed Draw Term Loan was repaid with the proceeds of the offering of the 7.500% Senior Notes. The Delayed Draw Term Loan was terminated and the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.7 million were expensed.
Credit Facility
On November 28, 2018, Newmark entered into the Credit Agreement by and among Newmark, the several financial institutions from time to time party thereto, as lenders, and Bank of America N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provided for a $250.0 million Credit Facility.
On February 26, 2020, Newmark entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement, increasing the size of the Credit Facility to $425.0 million and extending the maturity date to February 26, 2023. The interest rate on the Credit Facility was reduced to LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum, subject to a pricing grid linked to Newmark’s credit ratings from S&P Global Ratings and Fitch. 
On March 16, 2020, Newmark entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement, increasing the size of the Credit Facility to $465.0 million. The interest rate on the Credit Facility was LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum, subject to a pricing grid linked to Newmark’s credit ratings from S&P Global Ratings and Fitch. 
On March 10, 2022, Newmark amended and restated the Credit Agreement, as amended. Pursuant to the amended and restated Credit Agreement, the lenders agreed to: (a) increase the amount available to the Company under the Credit Facility to $600.0 million, (b) extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility to March 10, 2025, and (c) improve pricing to 1.50% per annum with respect to Term SOFR (as defined in the amended and restated Credit Agreement) borrowings.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either (a) Term SOFR for interest periods of one or three months, as selected by the Company, or upon the consent of all lenders, such other period that is 12 months or less (in each case, subject to availability), as selected by the Company, plus an applicable margin, or (b) a base rate equal to the greatest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the prime rate as established by the Administrative Agent (as such term is defined in the amended and restated Credit Agreement), and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.00%, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin was initially 1.50% with respect to Term SOFR borrowings in (a) above and 0.50% with respect to base rate borrowings in (b) above. The applicable margin with respect to Term SOFR borrowings in (a) above could range from 1.00% to 2.125% depending upon the Company’s credit rating, and with respect to base rate borrowings in (b) above could range from 0.00% to 1.125% depending upon the Company’s credit rating. The Credit Agreement also provides for certain upfront and arrangement fees and for an unused facility fee. 
On November 8, 2023, Newmark provided notice to Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, to borrow $130.0 million under the Credit Facility with the funds made available on November 14, 2023. The Company used the proceeds of the Credit Facility draw to pay the remaining maturing principal and interest of the Company’s $550.0 million 6.125% Senior Notes due November 15, 2023 that was not paid for with the proceeds of the Delayed Draw Term Loan. 
75
On December 20, 2023, Newmark drew $130.0 million of Newmark Revolving Loans under the Cantor Credit Agreement to repay the $130.0 million balance then outstanding under the Credit Facility.  
On April 26, 2024, Newmark amended and restated the Credit Agreement, which amendment and restatement, among other things, extends the maturity date of the Credit Facility to April 26, 2027. The borrowing rates and financial covenants under the Credit Agreement are substantially consistent with the Credit Agreement prior to such amendment and restatement.
During the 
year ended December 31, 2024
, there were $245.0 million of borrowings and $170.0 million of repayments under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2024, there were $75.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2024, borrowings under the Credit Facility carried an interest rate of 6.15%, with a weighted-average interest rate of 6.66% for the 
year ended December 31, 2024. 
As of December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. 
7.500% Senior Notes
On January 12, 2024, Newmark closed its offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.500% Senior Notes. The notes are general senior unsecured obligations of Newmark. Cantor purchased $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.500% Senior Notes in the offering, and still holds such notes as of March 3, 2025. The Company received net proceeds from the offering of the 7.500% Senior Notes of approximately $594.7 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and estimated offering expenses. The notes bear interest at a rate of 7.500% per year, payable in cash on January 12 and July 12 of each year, commencing July 12, 2024. The 7.500% Senior Notes will mature on January 12, 2029. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering of the 7.500% Senior Notes to repay all of the $420.0 million outstanding under its Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement. Additional net proceeds were used to repay all $130.0 million of then outstanding revolving debt, including with respect to borrowings under the Cantor Credit Agreement.
The 7.500% Senior Notes were initially offered and sold in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. Customary registration rights were provided to purchasers of the 7.500% Senior Notes. On May 10, 2024, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4, which was declared effective by the SEC on June 6, 2024. On June 10, 2024, we launched an exchange offer in which holders of the 7.500% Senior Notes which were issued in the January 12, 2024 private placement could exchange such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms. The exchange offer expired on July 17, 2024, at which point the tendered 7.500% Senior Notes were exchanged for new registered notes with substantially identical terms. 
See “—Certain Related Party Transactions —7.500% Senior Notes” below for further discussion.
Cantor Credit Agreement
On November 30, 2018, Newmark entered into an unsecured credit agreement with Cantor. The Cantor Credit Agreement provides for each party to issue loans to the other party in the lender’s discretion. Pursuant to the Cantor Credit Agreement, the parties and their respective subsidiaries (with respect to Cantor, other than BGC and its subsidiaries) may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million from each other from time to time at an interest rate which is the higher of Cantor or Newmark’s short-term borrowing rate then in effect, plus 1.0%. 
On December 20, 2023, Newmark entered into a first amendment to the Cantor Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the First Cantor Credit Agreement Amendment, Cantor agreed to make certain loans to Newmark from time to time in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to $150.0 million under the Cantor Credit Agreement. The Newmark Revolving Loans have substantially the same terms as other loans under the Cantor Credit Agreement, except that until April 15, 2024, the Newmark Revolving Loans would bear interest at a rate equal to 25 basis points less than the interest rate borne by the revolving loans made pursuant to the Credit Facility. Unlike other loans made under the Cantor Credit Agreement, Cantor may demand repayment of the Newmark Revolving Loans prior to the final maturity date of the Cantor Credit Agreement upon three business days’ prior written notice. Also on December 20, 2023, Newmark drew $130.0 million of Newmark Revolving Loans, and used the proceeds to repay the $130.0 million balance then outstanding under the Credit Facility.
On January 12, 2024, the outstanding balance under the Cantor Credit Agreement was repaid with the proceeds of the offering of the 7.500% Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Cantor Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, there was $130.0 million outstanding under the Cantor Credit Agreement.
Warehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises
As of December 31, 2024, Newmark had $1.5 billion of committed loan funding, $1.1 billion of uncommitted loan funding available through three commercial banks, and an uncommitted $500.0 million Fannie Mae loan repurchase facility. Consistent with industry practice, these warehouse facilities are short-term, requiring annual renewal. These warehouse facilities are collateralized by an assignment of the underlying mortgage loans originated under various lending programs and 
76
third-party purchase commitments and are recourse only to our wholly owned subsidiary, Berkeley Point Capital, LLC. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had $0.8 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, outstanding under “Warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises” on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
On June 19, 2020, Newmark established a $125.0 million sublimit line of credit to fund potential principal and interest servicing advances on its Fannie Mae portfolio during the forbearance period related to the CARES Act. The sublimit was included within the Company’s then-existing $450 million warehouse facility. The advance line provided 100% of the principal and interest advance payment at a rate of SOFR plus 1.80% and was collateralized by Fannie Mae’s commitment to repay advances. There were no outstanding draws under this sublimit as of December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Newmark did not have any Fannie Mae loans in forbearance as of December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023. On May 7, 2024, the related warehouse line was renewed, removing the $125.0 million sublimit line of credit.
Leases
Total lease liability as of December 31, 2024 was $598.3 million. Of the total amount, $151.1 million of lease liability is within our flexible workspace business whereby the liability is ring-fenced in SPVs with only $22.6 million of guarantees and/or letters of credit with exposure to Newmark. There was an additional $10.2 million of guarantees and/or letters of credit related to lease liabilities not in consolidated SPVs.

In addition, Newmark had contracted future customer revenues and sub-lease income as of December 31, 2024 amounting to approximately $158.2 million.
Debt Repurchase Authorization
On June 16, 2020, the Board and the Audit Committee authorized a debt repurchase program for the repurchase by the Company in the amount of up to $50.0 million of Company debt securities. Repurchases of Company debt securities, if any, are expected to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption.
Under the authorization, the Company may make repurchases of Company debt securities for cash from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions upon such terms and at such prices as management may determine. Additionally, the Company is authorized to make any such repurchases of Company debt securities through CF&Co (or its affiliates), in its capacity as agent or principal, or such other broker-dealers as management shall determine to utilize from time to time upon customary market terms or commissions.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $50.0 million remaining from its debt repurchase authorization.

Outlook
Fitch Ratings Inc.
BBB-
Stable
JCRA

Credit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by several factors including, but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels and the firm’s competitive position in the industry. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Any reduction in our credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on terms acceptable to us, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions. The interest rate on our 7.500% Senior Notes may increase by up to 2% in the event of credit ratings downgrades.

Partnership units collectively include FPUs, limited partnership units, and Cantor Units (see Note 2 — “Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings” to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information). In general, these partnership units are potentially exchangeable into shares of Newmark Class A common stock. In addition, the partnership units held by Cantor as of December 31, 2024 are generally exchangeable into up to 25.6 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock and/or Newmark Class B common stock. These partnership units also generally receive quarterly allocations of net income, after the deduction of the Preferred Distribution, based on their weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. As a result, these partnership units are included in the fully diluted share count calculation shown above.

Registration Statements
We have an effective registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the offer and sale of up to 20.0 million shares and rights to acquire shares of our Class A common stock from time to time in connection with business combination transactions, including acquisitions of other businesses, assets, properties or securities. As of December 31, 2024, we have issued 2.7 million shares of our Class A common stock under this registration statement. 
Contingent Payments Related to Acquisitions
80
Newmark completed acquisitions from 2019 through the fourth quarter of 2024 with contingent cash consideration of $
9.6
 million. The contingent equity instruments and cash liability is recorded at fair value in “Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities” on Newmark’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Legal Proceedings
See the discussion under the heading “Transactions with Executive Officers and Directors,” in Note 24 — “Related Party Transactions” to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information regarding Mr. Lutnick's December 2021 bonus award.
On August 5, 2022, Robert Garfield filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Robert Garfield v. Howard W. Lutnick, et al. (Case No. 2022-0687) (the “Garfield action”), against the members of the Board and Mr. Lutnick in his capacity as Chairman of the Board and controlling stockholder. This derivative complaint alleges that in connection with the December 2021 bonus award, payable over a three-year period, granted to Mr. Lutnick: (i) the Board breached its fiduciary duty, (ii) neither the award nor the approval process employed by the Compensation Committee were entirely fair to the Company and its stockholders, and (iii) the members of the Compensation Committee did not exercise independent judgment. The complaint alleges that Mr. Lutnick breached his fiduciary duty as Chairman and controlling shareholder by forcing the Company to grant the award and by accepting it. The complaint seeks rescission of the award and other compensation, as well as damages and other relief.
On October 7, 2022, Cardinal Capital Management, LLC filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Cardinal Capital Management, LLC v. Howard W. Lutnick, et al. (Case No. 2022-0909-SG) (the “Cardinal action”), against Mr. Lutnick, the members of the Compensation Committee in 2021, who were Virginia S. Bauer, Kenneth A. McIntyre and Michael Snow as members of the Compensation Committee, and Barry Gosin, Michael Rispoli and Stephen Merkel, as Newmark’s executive officers. The derivative complaint alleges that in connection with the Company’s June 2021 partnership units exchange for Mr. Lutnick and Officers (as such term is defined in the Cardinal action) and the December 2021 bonus award, payable over a three-year period, granted to Mr. Lutnick: (i) the Compensation Committee and Officers breached their fiduciary duties and wasted corporate assets; and (ii) Mr. Lutnick and the Officers were unjustly enriched. The complaint also alleges that Mr. Lutnick breached his fiduciary duty as Chairman and controlling shareholder, and wasted corporate assets, by forcing the Company to grant the award and by accepting it. The complaint seeks recoupment of the partnership units exchange and the bonus award, as well as damages and other relief.
On December 13, 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered an order consolidating the Garfield and Cardinal actions into a single, consolidated action (Consolidated C.A. No. 2022-0687, hereinafter the “Consolidated Shareholder Action”) deemed to have commenced on August 5, 2022, when the Garfield action was filed. On January 10, 2023, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, whose claims, as well as requested relief, mirror the claims and relief sought in the Cardinal action in all material respects. The Company’s position is that the partnership units exchange was appropriate and in the best interests of the Company, and that the bonus award was properly approved by the Compensation Committee comprised of independent directors (which does not include Mr. Lutnick) after careful consideration of his contributions to the Company, including the Company’s superior financial results, and following an extensive process that included advice from independent legal counsel and an independent compensation. 
On December 21, 2024, the parties to the Consolidated Shareholder Action agreed to settle the matter for a cash payment of $50 million to Newmark less any fees awarded to plaintiffs’ counsel by the Court following a hearing, to be paid by Newmark’s directors’ and officers’ insurance carriers, within 15 business days after entry of judgment.

The proposed settlement, which requires the Court of Chancery’s approval, is intended to fully settle and release, with prejudice, any and all actual or potential claims between the parties to the settlement that arise out of or otherwise relate to the claims asserted in the Consolidated Shareholder Action.

The proposed settlement is not evidence of the validity or invalidity of any claims or defenses in this action or any other actions or proceedings, or of any wrongdoing by any of the defendants, or of any damages or injury to Newmark or the plaintiffs.

The defendants in this action have denied, and continue to deny, all allegations of wrongdoing, fault, liability or damage with respect to all claims asserted or that could be asserted in the Consolidated Shareholder Action.

The Court of Chancery will consider the proposed settlement and all related matters, including plaintiffs’ fee award applications, at a hearing on May 5, 2025, at 11:00 a.m.

If the Court approves the settlement, the Court will enter judgment, at which time the action will be dismissed with prejudice. 
On March 9, 2023, a purported class action complaint was filed against Cantor, BGC Holdings, and Newmark Holdings in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (Civil Action No. 1:23-cv-00265). The collective action, which was filed by seven former limited partners on their own behalf and on behalf of other similarly situated limited partners, alleges a claim for breach of contract against all defendants on the basis that the defendants failed to make payments due under the relevant partnership agreements. Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that the non-compete and economic forfeiture provisions upon which the defendants relied to deny payment are unenforceable under Delaware law. The plaintiffs allege a second claim 
81
against Cantor and BGC Holdings for antitrust violations under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended, on the basis that the Cantor and BGC Holdings partnership agreements constitute unreasonable restraints of trade. In that regard, the plaintiffs allege that the non-compete and economic forfeiture provisions of the Cantor and BGC Holdings partnership agreements, as well as restrictive covenants included in partner separation agreements, cause anticompetitive effects in the labor market, insulate Cantor and BGC Holdings from competition, and limit innovation. The plaintiffs seek a determination that the case may be maintained as a class action, an injunction prohibiting the allegedly anticompetitive conduct, and monetary damages of at least $5,000,000. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and in response, on May 31, 2023, plaintiffs filed an Amended Class Action Complaint alleging similar allegations as a basis for claims for breach of contract and violation of the Sherman Act. Defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint. On February 23, 2024, plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint, repleading claims for violation of federal antitrust laws and challenging economic forfeiture and non-compete obligations as violative of federal competition law. On December 2, 2024, the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. On December 16, 2024, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The parties are in the process of briefing the appeal.

The Company continues to believe the lawsuit has no merit and that the District Court’s dismissal of the matter will be affirmed on appeal. However, as with any litigation, the outcome cannot be determined with certainty.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP guidance requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our accompanying consolidated financial statements. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows could be materially affected. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenues primarily through commissions from brokerage services, commercial mortgage origination, net, revenues from real estate management services, servicing fees and other revenues. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when, or as, we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services to the customers as determined by when, or as, the customer obtains control of that good or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied over time is recognized by measuring our progress in satisfying the performance obligation as evidenced by the transfer of the goods or services to the customer. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control over the promised good or service.
The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those promised goods or services (i.e., the “transaction price”). In determining the transaction price, we consider consideration promised in a contract that includes a variable amount, referred to as variable consideration, and estimate the amount of consideration due to us. Additionally, variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. In determining when to include variable consideration in the transaction price, we consider all information (historical, current and forecast) that is available, including the range of possible outcomes, the predictive value of past experiences, the time period of when uncertainties are expected to be resolved and the amount of consideration that is susceptible to factors outside of our influence.
We also use third-party service providers in the provision of services to our customers. In instances where a third-party service provider is used, we perform an analysis to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent with respect to the services provided. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, the revenue and the expenses incurred are recorded on a gross basis. In instances where we are acting as an agent, the revenue and expenses are presented on a net basis within the revenue line item.
In some instances, we perform services for customers and incur out-of-pocket expenses as part of delivering those services. Our customers agree to reimburse us for those expenses, and those reimbursements are part of the contract’s transaction price. Consequently, these expenses and the reimbursements of such expenses from the customer are presented on a gross basis because the services giving rise to the out-of-pocket expenses do not transfer a good or service. The reimbursements are included in the transaction price when the costs are incurred, and the reimbursements are due from the customer.
MSRs, Net

82
We initially recognize and measure the rights to service mortgage loans at fair value and subsequently measure them using the amortization method. We recognize rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets at the time the underlying originated mortgage loan is sold, and the value of those rights is included in the determination of the gains on loans held for sale. Purchased MSRs, including MSRs purchased from CCRE, are initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently measured using the amortization method.
We receive up to a three-basis point servicing fee and/or up to a one-basis point surveillance fee on certain Freddie Mac loans after the loan is securitized in a Freddie Mac pool. The Freddie Mac Strip is also recognized at fair value and subsequently measured using the amortization method, but is recognized as a MSR at the securitization date.
MSRs are assessed for impairment, at least on an annual basis, based upon the fair value of those rights as compared to the amortized cost. Fair values are estimated using a valuation model that calculates the present value of the future net servicing cash flows. In using this valuation method, we incorporate assumptions that management believes market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. The fair value estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions used in the valuation model such as prepayment rates, cost of servicing, escrow earnings rates, discount rates and servicing multiples, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions derived, in part, from historical data. It is reasonably possible that such estimates may change. We amortize the MSRs in proportion to, and over the period of, the projected net servicing income. For purposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, we stratify MSRs based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans, primarily by investor type (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac, FHA/Ginnie Mae, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other). To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a specific MSR strata, a valuation allowance is established, which is adjusted in the future as the fair value of MSRs increases or decreases. Reversals of valuation allowances cannot exceed the previously recognized impairment up to the amortized cost.
Equity-Based and Other Compensation
Discretionary Bonus: A portion of our compensation and employee benefits expense comprises discretionary bonuses, which may be paid in cash, equity, partnership awards or a combination thereof. We accrue expense in a period based on revenues in that period and on the expected combination of cash, equity and partnership units. Given the assumptions used in estimating discretionary bonuses, actual results may differ.
RSUs: We account for equity-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of U.S. GAAP guidance. RSUs provided to certain employees are accounted for as equity awards, and in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. Further, the Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and revises, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Because significant assumptions are used in estimating employee turnover and associated forfeiture rates, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The fair value of RSU awards to employees is determined on the date of grant, based on the fair value of our Class A common stock. Generally, RSUs granted by us as employee compensation do not receive dividend equivalents; as such, we adjust the fair value of the RSUs for the present value of expected forgone dividends, which requires us to include an estimate of expected dividends as a valuation input. This grant-date fair value is amortized to expense ratably over the awards’ vesting periods. For RSUs with graded vesting features, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis. The amortization is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Restricted Stock: Restricted stock provided to certain employees is accounted for as an equity award, and as per U.S. GAAP guidance, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. We have granted restricted stock that is not subject to continued employment or service; however, transferability is subject to compliance with our and our affiliates’ customary non-compete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by partners in five to 10 years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Limited Partnership Units: Limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings are held by Newmark employees and receive quarterly allocations of net income and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As discussed above, Preferred Units in Newmark Holdings are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to a distribution at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. The quarterly allocations of net income to such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the Corporate Conversion, certain Newmark employees held BGC Holdings limited partnership units with similar entitlements.
83
Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder’s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that Newmark record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations as part of “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.” The liability for limited partnership units with a post-termination payout is included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Certain limited partnership units held by Newmark employees are granted exchangeability into Class A common stock or may be redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of Class A common stock. At the time exchangeability is granted, or the shares are issued, Newmark recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Employee Loans: We have entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans that may be either wholly or in part repaid from distributions that the individuals receive on some or all of their limited partnership interests and from proceeds of the sale of the employees’ shares of our Class A common stock or may be forgiven over a period of time. Cash advance distribution loans are documented in formal agreements and are repayable in timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. We intend for these advances to be repaid in full from the future distributions on existing and future awards granted or the proceeds of the sales of the employees’ shares. The allocations of net income to the awards are treated as compensation expense and the proceeds from distributions are used to repay the loan. The forgivable portion of any loan is recognized as compensation expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations over the life of the loan. We review the loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If we determine that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, we recognize a reserve against the loan balances. Actual collectability of loan balances may differ from our estimates. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate balance of employee loans, net of reserve, was $769.4 million and $651.2 million, respectively, and is included as “Loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners, net” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Compensation expense for the above-mentioned employee loans for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was $123.9 million, $92.9 million, and $84.1 million, respectively. The compensation expense related to these loans was included as part of “Compensation and employee benefits” in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, 
Intangibles – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically tested for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs, or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis as follows.
The quantitative goodwill impairment test, used to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of impairment loss, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss should be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. To estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, we use a discounted cash flow model and data regarding market comparables. The valuation process requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These assumptions include cash flow projections, estimated cost of capital and the selection of peer companies and relevant multiples. Because significant assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future cash flows, choosing peer companies and selecting relevant multiples, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Credit Losses
The CECL methodology requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period beyond the balance sheet date.
84
The expected credit loss is modeled based on our historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current conditions. A significant amount of judgment is required in the determination of the appropriate reasonable and supportable period, the methodology used to incorporate current and future macroeconomic conditions, determination of the probability of and exposure at default, all of which are ultimately used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves. Beyond the reasonable and supportable period, we estimate expected credit losses using our historical loss rates. We also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves for certain external and internal qualitative factors, which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for credit losses and receivables. In order to estimate credit losses, assumptions about current and future economic conditions are incorporated into the model using multiple economic scenarios that are weighted to reflect the conditions at each measurement date. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, there was a decrease of $7.9 million in our reserves, of which $1.1 million reduced “Operating, administrative, and other” expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. These reserves were based on macroeconomic forecasts which are critical inputs into our model and material movements in variables such as the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. GDP growth rate which could significantly affect our estimated expected credit losses. These macroeconomic forecasts, under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates, could result in significantly different changes in reserves for credit losses. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the overall reserves for credit losses and current results may not reflect the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast changes.
Income Taxes
Newmark accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to basis differences between our accompanying consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of Newmark’s entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to primarily the UBT in New York City. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for the UBT rests with the partners, rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners’ tax liability or benefit is not reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions.
Newmark provides for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because significant assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from Newmark’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Newmark recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in “Provision for income taxes” in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, Newmark considers all available evidence, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.
The measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws and involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. Because Newmark’s interpretation of complex tax law may impact the measurement of current and deferred income taxes, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions regarding the application of tax law.
Derivative Financial Instruments
We have loan commitments to extend credit to third parties. The commitments to extend credit are for mortgage loans at a specific rate (rate lock commitments). These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require a fee. We are committed to extend credit to the counterparty as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment contracts. Whenever we commit to extend credit, we simultaneously enter into a Forward Sales Contract. 
85
Both the commitment to extend credit and the forward sale commitment qualify as derivative financial instruments. We recognize all derivatives on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The change in the derivatives fair value is recognized in current period earnings.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1 — “Organization and Basis of Presentation” to our accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Credit Risk
Our multifamily origination business under the Fannie Mae DUS program originates and services multifamily loans for Fannie Mae without having to obtain Fannie Mae’s prior approval for certain loans, as long as the loans meet the underwriting guidelines set forth by Fannie Mae. In return for the delegated authority to make loans and the commitment to purchase loans by Fannie Mae, we must maintain minimum collateral and generally are required to share risk of loss on loans sold through Fannie Mae. With respect to most loans, we are generally required to absorb approximately one-third of any losses on the unpaid principal balance of a loan at the time of loss settlement. Some of the loans that we originate under the Fannie Mae DUS program are subject to reduced levels of risk-sharing. However, we generally receive lower servicing fees with respect to such loans. Although our Berkeley Point business’s average annual losses from such risk-sharing programs have been a minimal percentage of the aggregate principal amount of such loans, if loan defaults increase, actual risk-sharing obligation payments under the Fannie Mae DUS program could increase, and such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, a material failure to pay its share of losses under the Fannie Mae DUS program could result in the revocation of Berkeley Point’s license from Fannie Mae and the exercise of various remedies available to Fannie Mae under the Fannie Mae DUS program.
Interest Rate Risk 
On January 12, 2024, Newmark closed its offering of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.500% Senior Notes. These debt obligations are not currently subject to fluctuations in interest rates, although in the event of refinancing or issuance of new debt, such debt could be subject to changes in interest rates. Newmark had outstanding $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.500% Senior Notes and $75.0 million outstanding on the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024. The interest rate on the Credit Facility is currently based upon SOFR.
Berkeley Point is an intermediary that originates loans which are generally pre-sold prior to loan closing. Therefore, for loans held for sale to the GSEs and HUD, we are not currently exposed to unhedged interest rate risk. Prior to closing on loans with borrowers, we enter into agreements to sell the loans to investors, and originated loans are typically sold within 45 days of funding. The coupon rate for each loan is set concurrently with the establishment of the interest rate with the investor.
Some of our assets and liabilities are subject to changes in interest rates. Earnings from escrows are generally based on SOFR. The 30-day SOFR as of December 31, 2024 was 453 basis points and 534 basis points at December 31, 2023. A 100-basis point increase in the 30-day SOFR would increase our annual earnings by $15.1 million based on our escrow balances as of December 31, 2024 and by $11.2 million based on our escrow balances as of December 31, 2023. A 100-basis point decrease in the 30-day SOFR would decrease our annual earnings by $15.1 million based on our escrow balances as of December 31, 2024 and by $11.2 million based on the escrow balances as of December 31, 2023.
We use warehouse facilities and repurchase agreements to fund loans we originate under our various lending programs. The borrowing costs of our warehouse facilities and the repurchase agreement is based on SOFR. A 100-basis point increase in 30-day SOFR would decrease our annual earnings by $7.5 million based on our outstanding balances as of December 31, 2024 and by $5.0 million based on our outstanding balances as of December 31, 2023. A 100 basis-point decrease in 30-day SOFR would increase our annual earnings by approximately $7.5 million based on our outstanding warehouse balance as of December 31, 2024 and by approximately $5.0 million based on our outstanding warehouse balance as of December 31, 2023. During 2024, the borrowing costs we incurred on our warehouse facilities exceeded the amount of interest income we earned from loans held for sale due to the inverted yield curve. Our borrowing costs are based on a short term SOFR rate, while the interest rate we earn on loans held for sale are based on U.S. Treasury rates plus a credit spread.
Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates create volatility in the U.S. dollar equivalent of our revenues and expenses. While our international results of operations, as measured in U.S. dollars, are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations, we do not consider the related risk to be material to our results of 
86
operations. While our exposure to foreign exchange risk is not currently material to us, we expect to grow our international revenues in the future, and any future potential exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations may present a material risk to our business.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Newmark Group, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Mortgage Servicing Rights, net
Description of the Matter
At December 31, 2024, the Company’s Mortgage Servicing Rights, net (“MSRs”) were $518 million. As discussed in Note 3 and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company initially recognizes and measures the rights to service mortgage loans at fair value and subsequently measures them using the amortization method. MSRs are assessed for impairment, at least on an annual basis, based upon the fair value of those rights as compared to the amortized cost. Fair values are estimated using a valuation model that calculates the present value of the future net servicing cash flows. 
Auditing management’s valuation of MSRs was complex and required significant judgment due to the estimation used by the Company in determining the fair value of the MSRs. In particular, the fair value estimates were sensitive to significant assumptions such as prepayment rates, cost of servicing, escrow earnings rates, and discount rates, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions derived, in part, from historical data.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls related to the Company’s MSRs valuation process, including management’s assessment of the significant assumptions included in the fair value estimates.  
To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s MSRs, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the significant assumptions used by the Company to develop the fair value estimates.  For example, we compared the significant assumptions to the Company’s historical results and current industry, market and economic trends. We evaluated the Company’s use of the valuation model that calculates the present value of the future net servicing cash flows as well as the completeness and accuracy of selected inputs to the model. We utilized an internal valuation specialist to test management’s valuation model, significant assumptions and to identify potential sources of contrary information for selected assumptions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Newmark Group, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Newmark Group, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Newmark Group, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NEWMARK GROUP, INC.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(1)    
Organization and Basis of Presentation
Newmark Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed as NRE Delaware, Inc. on November 18, 2016. Newmark changed its name to Newmark Group, Inc. on October 18, 2017. Newmark Holdings, L.P. is a consolidated subsidiary of Newmark for which Newmark is the general partner. Newmark and Newmark Holdings jointly own Newmark Partners, L.P., the operating partnership. Newmark is a leading commercial real estate advisor and service provider to large institutional investors, global corporations, and other owners and occupiers. Newmark offers a diverse array of integrated services and products designed to meet the full needs of its clients. Newmark’s investor/owner services and products include capital markets, which consists of investment sales and commercial mortgage origination (including the placement of debt, equity raising, structured finance, and loan sales on behalf of third parties), landlord (or agency) representation leasing, valuation and advisory, property management and flexible workspace solutions for owners, a leading commercial real estate technology platform and capabilities for owners, due diligence consulting and other advisory services, GSEs and FHA multifamily lending and loan servicing, limited and special loan servicing and asset management, and business rates for U.K. property owners.

Newmark has relationships with many of the world’s largest commercial property owners, real estate developers and investors, as well as Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 2000 companies.
(a)

Basis of Presentation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current presentation.
“Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” reflects the following items related to cash and equity-based compensation:
•
Charges with respect to the grant of shares of common stock or limited partnership units, including in connection with the redemption of non-exchangeable limited partnership units, including PSUs; 
•
Charges with respect to grants of exchangeability, such as the right of holders of limited partnership units with no capital accounts, such as PSUs, to exchange the units into shares of common stock, or HDUs, as well as the cash paid in the settlement of the related Preferred Units to pay withholding taxes owed by the unit holder upon such exchange;
•
Preferred Units granted in connection with the grant of certain limited partnership units, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder, rather than issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes;
•
Charges related to the amortization of RSUs and REUs; and
•
Allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs, including the Preferred Distribution. 
Intercompany balances and transactions within Newmark have been eliminated. Transactions between Cantor and Newmark pursuant to services agreements with Cantor (see Note 24 — “Related Party Transactions”), representing valid receivables and liabilities of Newmark which are periodically cash settled, have been included on the accompanying consolidated financial statements as either receivables from or payables to related parties. 
Newmark receives administrative services to support its operations, and in return, Cantor allocates certain of its expenses to Newmark. Such expenses represent costs related to, but not limited to, treasury, legal, accounting, information technology, payroll administration, human resources, incentive compensation plans and other services. These costs, together with an allocation of Cantor’s overhead costs, are included as Fees to related parties expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Where it is possible to specifically attribute such expenses to activities of Newmark, these amounts have been expensed directly to Newmark. Allocation of all other such expenses is based on services agreements with Cantor which reflect the utilization of services provided or benefits received by Newmark during the periods presented on a consistent basis, such as headcount, square footage, revenue, etc. Management believes the assumptions underlying the stand-alone financial statements, including the assumptions regarding allocated expenses, reasonably reflect the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by Newmark during the periods presented. However, these shared expenses may not represent the amounts that would have been incurred had Newmark operated independently from Cantor. Actual costs that 
98
would have been incurred if Newmark had performed the services itself would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure (see Note 24 — “Related Party Transactions” for an additional discussion of expense allocations).
Transfers of cash, except as related to the Cantor Credit Agreement, both to and from Cantor, as well as any amounts due to Newmark from BGC, are included in “Receivables from related parties” or “Payables to related parties” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and in the operating section on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated statements of changes in equity of Newmark for the periods presented.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, 
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers
. The standard improves the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the recognition of an acquired contract liability, as well as payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The ASU requires companies to apply guidance in ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination, and, thus, creates an exception to the general recognition and measurement principle in ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
. Newmark adopted the standard on the required effective date beginning January 1, 2023 using a prospective transition method for business combinations occurring on or after the effective date. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, 
Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures
. The guidance is intended to improve the decision usefulness of information provided to investors about certain loan refinancings, restructurings, and write-offs. The standard eliminates the recognition and measurement guidance on TDRs for creditors that have adopted ASC 326, 
Financial Instruments — Credit Losses
 and requires them to make enhanced disclosures about loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The new guidance also requires public business entities to present current-period gross write-offs (on a current year-to-date basis for interim-period disclosures) by year of origination in their vintage disclosures. Newmark adopted the new standard on the required effective date beginning January 1, 2023. The guidance for recognition and measurement of TDRs was applied using a prospective transition method, and the amendments related to disclosures will be applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, 
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848
. ASU No. 2020-04, 
Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting
 provided optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The ASU was effective upon issuance and generally could be applied through December 31, 2022. Because the relief in ASC 848, 
Reference Rate Reform
 may not cover a period of time during which a significant number of modifications may take place, the amendments in ASU No. 2022-06 deferred the sunset date from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in ASC 848. The ASU was effective upon issuance. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. The guidance was issued in response to requests from investors for companies to disclose more information about their financial performance at the segment level. The ASU does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The standard requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis, and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide the new disclosures and all the disclosures previously required under ASC 280. Newmark adopted the standard on the required effective date for the financial statements issued for the annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2024 and will apply the guidance for the interim periods beginning on January 1, 2025. Refer to Note 3—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The adoption of this ASU affects only disclosures, with no impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

New Accounting Pronouncements 
99
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, 
Disclosure Improvements—Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. 
The standard is expected to clarify or improve

disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of Codification Topics, allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to the requirements, and align the requirements in the Codification with the SEC’s regulations. The effective date for the guidance will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of the related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective. If by June 30, 2027 the SEC has not removed the applicable requirements from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the Codification and will not become effective for any entity. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. The standard improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The ASU also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The new guidance will become effective for Newmark’s financial statements issued for annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2025, will require prospective presentation with an option for entities to apply it retrospectively for each period presented, and early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-01, 
Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards
. The standard is intended to reduce the complexity in determining whether profits interests and similar awards are in the scope of ASC 718 and to reduce diversity in practice. The new guidance applies to all reporting entities that grant profits interest awards or similar awards to employees or nonemployees in exchange for goods or services. The ASU adds an example to ASC 718 that illustrates how to apply the scope guidance to determine whether a profits interest award should be accounted for as a share-based payment arrangement under ASC 718 or another accounting standard. The new guidance became effective for Newmark beginning on January 1, 2025 and will be applied prospectively to profits interest awards granted or modified on or after the adoption date. The adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-02, 
Codification Improvements—Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements
. The Conceptual Framework establishes concepts that the Board considers in developing standards. The ASU was issued to remove references to the Conceptual Framework in the Codification. The FASB noted that references to the Concepts Statements in the Codification could have implied that the Concepts Statements are authoritative. Also, some of the references removed were to Concepts Statements that are superseded. The new guidance became effective for Newmark beginning on January 1, 2025 and will be applied prospectively to all new transactions recognized on or after the adoption date. The adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. The standard improves financial reporting and responds to investor input that additional expense detail is fundamental to understanding the performance of an entity, assessing its prospects for future cash flows, and comparing its performance over time and with that of other companies. The new guidance requires public business entities to disclose in the notes to financial statements specified information about certain costs and expenses at each interim and annual reporting period, including the amounts of employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization for each income statement line item that contains those expenses. Specified expenses, gains or losses that are already disclosed under existing U.S. GAAP will be required by the ASU to be included in the disaggregated income statement expense line item disclosures, and any remaining amounts will need to be described qualitatively. Separate disclosures of total selling expenses and an entity’s definition of those expenses will also be required. The new guidance will become effective for Newmark’s financial statements issued for annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2027 and interim reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2028, will require either prospective or retrospective presentation, and early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
SEC Rule on Climate-Related Disclosures
On March 6, 2024 the SEC adopted the final rules, 
The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, 
that would require registrants to provide climate-related disclosures in a note to the audited financial statements. The disclosures would include certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions, including the aggregate amounts and where in the financial statements they are presented. If carbon offsets or renewable energy credits or certificates (RECs) are deemed a material component of the registrant’s plans to achieve its disclosed climate-related targets, registrants would be required to disclose information about the offsets and RECs. Registrants would also be required to disclose 
100
whether and how (1) exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, severe weather events and other natural conditions and (2) any disclosed climate-related targets or transition plans materially impacted the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements. Finally, registrants would be required to disclose additional contextual information about the above disclosures, including how each financial statement effect was derived and the accounting policy decisions made to calculate the effects, for the most recently completed fiscal year and, if previously disclosed or required to be disclosed, for the historical fiscal year for which audited consolidated financial statements are included in the filing. Subsequent to the adoption, the SEC has released an order staying the final rules pending judicial review of all of the petitions challenging the rules. Absent the stay, the rules would have been effective for Newmark on May 28, 2024 and phased in starting in 2025. Management is currently monitoring the developments pertaining to the rules and any resulting potential impacts on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings
Newmark is a holding company with no direct operations and conducts substantially all of its operations through its operating subsidiaries. Virtually all of Newmark’s consolidated net assets and net income are those of consolidated variable interest entities. Newmark Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary of Newmark for which Newmark is the general partner. Newmark and Newmark Holdings jointly own Newmark OpCo, the operating partnership. In connection with the Separation and BGC Holdings Distribution, holders of BGC Holdings partnership interests received partnership interests in Newmark Holdings, described below (see Note 24 — “Related Party Transactions”). These collectively represented all of the limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings at the time.
As a result of the Separation, the limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings were distributed to the holders of limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings, whereby each holder of BGC Holdings limited partnership interests at that time received a corresponding Newmark Holdings limited partnership interest, determined by the Contribution Ratio, which was equal to a BGC Holdings limited partnership interest multiplied by one divided by 2.2, divided by the Exchange Ratio. Initially, the Exchange Ratio equaled 
one
, so that each Newmark Holdings limited partnership interest was exchangeable for 
one
 share of Newmark Class A common stock; however, such Exchange Ratio is subject to adjustment. For reinvestment, acquisition or other purposes, Newmark may determine on a quarterly basis to distribute to its stockholders a smaller percentage of its income than Newmark Holdings distributes to its equity holders (excluding tax distributions from Newmark Holdings) of the cash that it received from Newmark OpCo. In such circumstances, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that the Exchange Ratio will be reduced to reflect the amount of additional cash retained by Newmark as a result of the distribution of such smaller percentage, after the payment of taxes. As of December 31, 2024, the Exchange Ratio equaled 
0.9279
.
On November 15, 2022, BGC Group, BGC Partners, and BGC Holdings and other affiliated entities, entered into a corporate conversion agreement, which was amended as of March 29, 2023, in order to reorganize and simplify the organizational structure of the BGC entities by converting BGC Partners from an “Up-C” to a “Full C-Corporation” through the Corporate Conversion. On July 1, 2023, the Corporate Conversion was completed. As a result of the Corporate Conversion, BGC Group became the public holding company for, and successor to, BGC Partners, and its Class A common stock began trading on Nasdaq, in place of BGC Partners’ Class A common stock, under the ticker symbol “BGC.” Upon completion of the Corporate Conversion, the former stockholders of BGC Partners, Inc. and the former limited partners of BGC Holdings, L.P. now participate in the economics of the BGC businesses through BGC Group, Inc. There are no longer any BGC Holdings units outstanding. 
As a result of a series of transactions prior to and in anticipation of the Corporate Conversion, all BGC Holdings units held by Newmark employees were redeemed or exchanged, in each case, for shares of BGC Class A common stock.
Redeemable Partnership Interests
Founding/Working Partners have limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings. Newmark accounts for FPUs outside of permanent capital as “Redeemable partnership interests” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. This classification is applicable to FPUs because these units are redeemable upon termination of a partner, including a termination of employment, which can be at the option of the partner and not within the control of the issuer. On June 30, 2023, in connection with the Corporate Conversion, all FPUs of BGC Holdings were redeemed or exchanged. The Corporate Conversion had no impact on FPUs held by partners of Newmark Holdings.
FPUs generally receive quarterly allocations of net income. Upon termination of employment or otherwise ceasing to provide substantive services, the FPUs are generally redeemed, and the unit holders are no longer entitled to participate in the quarterly allocations of net income. These quarterly allocations of net income are contingent upon services being provided by the unit holder and are reflected as a component of compensation expense under “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations to the extent they relate to FPUs held by Newmark employees. There is no compensation expense related to FPUs held by BGC employees.
101
Limited Partnership Units
Certain employees of Newmark hold limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings (e.g., REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, HDUs, and LPUs, collectively the limited partnership units). Prior to the Corporate Conversion, any active employees of Newmark who held limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings had those units redeemed or exchanged for cash or restricted or unrestricted shares of BGC Class A common stock. The Corporate Conversion had no impact on LPUs in Newmark Holdings held by BGC employees.
Prior to the Separation, certain employees of both BGC and Newmark generally received limited partnership units in BGC Holdings. As a result of the Separation, these employees were distributed limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings equal to a BGC Holdings limited partnership unit multiplied by the Contribution Ratio. In addition, in the BGC Holdings Distribution, these employees also received additional limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings. Subsequent to the Separation, Newmark employees generally have been granted limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings. 
Generally, such limited partnership units receive quarterly allocations of net income and generally are contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance the quarterly allocations of net income on BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings limited partnership units held by Newmark employees are reflected as a component of compensation expense under “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, and the quarterly allocations of net income on Newmark Holdings limited partnership units held by BGC employees are reflected as a component of “Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests” on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. From time to time, Newmark issues limited partnership units as part of the consideration for acquisitions. 
Certain of these limited partnership units held by Newmark employees entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount of the units in 
four
 equal yearly installments after the holder’s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards and are included on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as part of “Accrued compensation,” and in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance, Newmark records compensation expense for the awards based on the change in value at each reporting date on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as part of “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.”
Certain Newmark employees hold Preferred Units. Each quarter, the net profits of Newmark Holdings are allocated to such units at a rate of either 
0.6875
% (which is 
2.75
% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. These allocations are deducted before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holder. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into Newmark’s Class A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly are not included in Newmark’s fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are reflected in compensation expense under “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. After deduction of the Preferred Distribution, the remaining partnership units generally receive quarterly allocation of net income based on their weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. In addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain limited partnership units, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder, rather than issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes.
Certain Newmark employees hold “N Units” that do not participate in quarterly partnership distributions and are not allocated any items of profit or loss. N Units become distribution earning limited partnership units either on a discretionary basis or ratably over a vesting term, if certain revenue thresholds are met at the end of each vesting term.
Cantor Units
Cantor holds limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings. Cantor Units are reflected as a component of “Noncontrolling interests” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Cantor receives quarterly allocations of net income (loss) which are reflected as a component of “Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests” on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
General 
Certain of the limited partnership interests, as described above, have been granted exchangeability into BGC Class A common stock, prior to the Corporate Conversion, or shares of Newmark Class A common stock, and additional limited partnership interests may become exchangeable for Newmark Class A common stock. At the time exchangeability is granted, 
102
Newmark recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In addition, certain limited partnership interests have been granted the right to exchange into a Newmark partnership unit with a capital account, such as HDUs. HDUs have a stated capital account which is initially based on the closing trading price of Newmark Class A common stock at the time the HDU is granted and are included in “Accrued compensation” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. HDUs participate in quarterly partnership distributions and are not exchangeable into shares of Class A common stock. Limited partnership interests held by Cantor in Newmark Holdings as of December 31, 2024 are exchangeable for up to 
25.6
 million shares of Newmark Class B common stock, which are convertible into Class A common stock. Limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings held by a partner or Cantor may become exchangeable for a number of shares of Newmark Class A or Class B common stock equal to the number of limited partnership interests multiplied by the Exchange Ratio at that time. As of December 31, 2024, the Exchange Ratio equaled 
0.9279
.
Each quarter, net income (loss) is allocated between the limited partnership interests and the common stockholders. In quarterly periods in which Newmark has a net loss, the loss is allocated to Cantor and reflected as a component of “Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests” on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In subsequent quarters in which Newmark has net income, the initial allocation of income to the limited partnership interests is allocated to Cantor, and reflected in, “Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests,” to recover any losses taken in earlier quarters, with the remaining income allocated to the limited partnership interests. This loss allocation process between limited partners and Cantor has no material impact on the net income (loss) allocated to common stockholders.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates:
The preparation of Newmark’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing these consolidated financial statements are reasonable. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates included on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Equity Investments and Marketable Securities:
In accordance with the guidance on recognition and measurement of equity investments, Newmark carries its marketable equity securities at fair value and recognizes any changes in fair value in consolidated net income (loss). Further, Newmark has elected to use a measurement alternative for its equity investments without a readily determinable fair value, pursuant to which these investments are initially recognized at cost and remeasured through earnings when there is an observable transaction involving the same or similar investment of the same issuer, or due to an impairment. Newmark’s investments, in which it has significant influence but not a controlling financial interest and of which it is not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for under the equity method (see Note 7 — “Investments” for additional information).

Revenue Recognition:
Management Services, Servicing Fees and Other:
Management services revenues include property management, facilities management, project management and valuation and appraisal. Management fees are recognized at the time the related services have been performed, unless future contingencies exist. This also includes revenue from the licensing of flexible workspaces to its customers by Knotel and Deskeo. In addition, in regard to management and facility service contracts, the owner of the property will typically reimburse Newmark for certain expenses that are incurred on behalf of the owner, which comprise primarily on-site employee salaries and related benefit costs. The amounts which are to be reimbursed per the terms of the services contract are recognized as revenue in the same period as the related expenses are incurred. In certain instances, Newmark subcontracts property management services to independent property managers, in which case Newmark passes a portion of its property management fee on to the subcontractor, and Newmark retains the balance. Accordingly, Newmark records these fees gross of the amounts paid to subcontractors, and the amounts paid to subcontractors are recognized as expenses in the same period.
Newmark also uses third party service providers in the provision of its services to customers. In instances where a third-party service provider is used, Newmark performs an analysis to determine whether it is acting as a principal or an agent with respect to the services provided. To the extent that Newmark determines that it is acting as a principal, the revenue and the expenses incurred are recorded on a gross basis. In instances where Newmark has determined that it is acting as an agent, the revenue and expenses are presented on a net basis within the revenue line item.
103
In some instances, Newmark performs services for customers and incurs out-of-pocket expenses as part of delivering those services. Newmark’s customers agree to reimburse Newmark for those expenses, and those reimbursements are part of the contract’s transaction price. Consequently, these expenses and the reimbursements of such expenses from the customer are presented on a gross basis because the services giving rise to the out-of-pocket expenses do not transfer a good or service. The reimbursements are included in the transaction price when the costs are incurred, and the reimbursements are due from the customer.
Servicing fees are earned for servicing mortgage loans and are recognized on an accrual basis over the lives of the related mortgage loans. Also included in servicing fees are the fees earned on prepayments, interest and placement fees on borrowers’ escrow accounts and other ancillary fees. Other revenues include interest income on loans held for sale.
Leasing and Other Commissions
:
Commissions from real estate lease brokerage transactions are typically recognized at a point in time on the date the lease is signed, if deemed not subject to significant reversal. The date the lease is signed represents the transfer of control and satisfaction of the performance obligation as the tenant has been secured. Commission payments may be due entirely upon lease execution or may be paid in installments upon the resolution of a future contingency (e.g. tenant move-in or payment of first month’s rent). 
Newmark also uses third party service providers in the provision of its services to customers. In instances where a third-party service provider is used, Newmark performs an analysis to determine whether it is acting as a principal or an agent with respect to the services provided. To the extent that Newmark determines that it is acting as a principal, the revenue and the expenses incurred are recorded on a gross basis. In instances where Newmark has determined that it is acting as an agent, the revenue and expenses are presented on a net basis within the revenue line item.
Capital Markets:
Capital markets consists of investment sales and commercial mortgage brokerage. Investment sales revenue from real estate sales brokerage and equity placement transactions are recognized at the time the service has been provided and the commission becomes legally due, except when future contingencies exist. In most cases, close of escrow or transfer of title is a future contingency, and revenue recognition is deferred until all contingencies are satisfied. Commercial mortgage origination revenue is generated from loan origination fees, sales premiums, mortgage brokerage, debt placement, loan sales, and the estimated fair value of the expected net servicing cash flows. The fair value of expected net future cash flows from servicing and loan originations and related fees and sales premiums, net, is recognized when a derivative asset or liability is recorded upon the commitment to originate a loan with a borrower and sell the loan to an investor. The derivative is recorded at fair value and includes loan origination fees, sales premiums, and the estimated fair value of the expected net servicing cash flows. The revenue is recognized net of related fees and commissions to third-party brokers. Mortgage brokerage and debt placement revenue is earned and recognized when the sale of a property closes, and title passes from seller to buyer.

Fees to Related Parties:
Newmark is allocated costs from Cantor for back-office services provided by Cantor and their affiliates, including occupancy of office space, utilization of fixed assets, accounting, operations, human resources and legal services and information technology. Fees are expensed as they are incurred.
Other Income, net:
Other income, net comprises of gains or losses recorded in connection with changes in fair value of contingent consideration (See Note 23 — “Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities”) in connection with entities acquired and the movement of mark-to-market and/or hedge on marketable securities that are classified as trading securities, Newmark’s pro rata share for equity method investments and unrealized gains or losses relating to investments carried under the measurement alternative (See Note 7 — “Investments” and Note 17 — “Other Current Assets and Other Assets”) and movements related to the impact of any unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses.
Restricted Cash:
Restricted cash represents cash set aside for amounts pledged for the benefit of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in excess of the required cash to secure Newmark’s financial guarantee liability.
Leases: 
Newmark enters into leasing arrangements in the ordinary course of business, as a lessee and has leases primarily relating to office space.
104
    Newmark determines whether an arrangement is a lease or includes a lease at the contract inception. ROU lease assets represent the Newmark’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Other than for leases with an initial term of twelve months or less, operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Lease payments may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise those options. Lease expense pertaining to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term (See Note 16 — “Leases” for additional information).
Current Expected Credit Losses:
In accordance with the guidance in ASC 326, Newmark presents its financial assets that are measured at amortized cost, net of an allowance for credit losses, which represents the amount expected to be collected over their estimated life. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets carried at amortized cost and credit exposures on off-balance sheet financial guarantees, as well as changes to expected lifetime credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. The CECL methodology represents a significant change from prior U.S. GAAP and replaced the prior multiple impairment methods, which generally required that a loss be incurred before it was recognized. Within the life cycle of a loan or other financial asset in scope, the CECL methodology generally results in the earlier recognition of the provision for credit losses and the related allowance for credit losses than under prior U.S. GAAP. The CECL methodology’s impact on expected credit losses, among other things, reflects Newmark’s view of the current state of the economy, forecasted macroeconomic conditions and Newmark’s portfolios.
Financial Guarantee Liability:
Newmark has adopted ASC 326 which impacted the expected credit loss reserving methodology for the financial guarantee liability provided under the Fannie Mae DUS and Freddie Mac TAH. The expected credit loss is modeled based on Newmark’s historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current economic conditions. A significant amount of judgment is required in the determination of the appropriate reasonable and supportable period, the methodology used to incorporate current and future macroeconomic conditions, determination of the probability of and exposure at default or non-payment, current delinquency status, loan size, terms, amortization types, and the forward-looking view of the primary risk drivers (debt-service coverage ratio and loan-to-value), all of which are ultimately used in measuring the quantitative components of the reserve. Beyond the reasonable and supportable period, Newmark estimates expected credit losses using its historical loss rates. In addition, Newmark reviews the reserves periodically and makes adjustments for certain external and internal qualitative factors, which may increase or decrease the reserves for credit losses. In order to estimate credit losses, assumptions about current and future economic conditions are incorporated into the model using multiple economic scenarios that are weighted to reflect the conditions at each measurement date.
 During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were increases (decreases) in the CECL related provision of $(
2.2
) million, $
0.9
 million and $
1.7
 million, respectively. The balance of the financial guarantee liabilities was $
26.3
 million and $
28.6
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is included in “Other long-term liabilities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Receivables, net:
Newmark has accrued commissions receivable from real estate brokerage transactions, management services and other receivables from contractual management assignments. Receivables are presented net of the CECL allowance as discussed above and are included in “Receivables, net” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For its CECL reserve, Newmark segregated its receivables into certain pools based on similar risk characteristics and further defined a range of potential loss rates for each pool based on aging. Newmark designed its methodology to allow for a range of loss rates in each pool such that changes in forward-looking conditions can be incorporated into the estimate. Each pool is assigned a loss rate that incorporates management’s view of current conditions and forward-looking conditions that inform the level of expected credit losses in each pool. The credit loss estimate includes specifically identified amounts for which payment has become unlikely.
 During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were increases (decreases) in the CECL related provision of $(
5.1
) million, $(
1.4
) million and $
4.2
 million, respectively. The balance of the reserve was $
14.4
 million and $
19.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is included in “Receivables, net” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Loans, Forgivable Loans and Other Receivables from Employees and Partners, net:
Newmark has entered into various agreements with certain of its employees and partners, whereby these individuals receive loans which may be either wholly or in part repaid from the distribution earnings that the individual receives on some or all of their limited partnership units and from proceeds of the sales of the employees’ shares of our Class A common stock or may be forgiven over a period of time. The forgivable portion of these loans is not included in Newmark’s estimate of expected credit losses when employees meet the conditions for forgiveness through their continued employment over the specified time period and is recognized as compensation expense over the life of the loan. The amounts due from terminated employees that 
105
Newmark does not expect to collect are included in the allowance for credit losses. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the balance of this reserve was $
8.8
 million and $
9.4
 million, respectively, and is included in “Loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners, net” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
From time to time, Newmark may also enter into agreements with employees and partners to grant bonus and salary advances or other types of loans. These advances and loans are repayable in the time frame outlined in the underlying agreements. Newmark reviews loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If Newmark determines that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, Newmark recognizes a reserve against the loan balances as compensation expense.

Reclassifications:
The Company has made reclassifications to prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations. “Commercial mortgage origination, net” and “Investment sales” have been combined into one line, “Capital markets.” For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, $
381.3
 million and $
606.4
 million, respectively, of Investment sales, and $
278.6
 million and $
357.8
 million, respectively, of Commercial mortgage origination, net, was combined and presented as $
659.9
 million and $
964.2
 million, respectively, of Capital markets.

Fair Value:
U.S. GAAP guidance defines fair value as the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and further expands disclosures about such fair value measurements.
The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
•
Level 1 measurements—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2 measurements—Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
•
Level 3 measurements—Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
Newmark considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are held with banks as deposits. The Company maintains deposits with high quality financial institutions in amounts that are in excess of federally insured limits; however, the Company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk.
Principles of Consolidation:
Newmark’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Newmark and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. Newmark’s policy is to consolidate all entities of which it owns more than 50% unless it does not have control over the entity. In accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance, 
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
, Newmark also consolidates any variable interest entities of which it is the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value:
Newmark maintains multifamily and commercial mortgage loans for the purpose of sale to GSEs. Prior to funding, Newmark enters into an agreement to sell the loans to third-party investors at a fixed price. During the period prior to sale, interest income is calculated and recognized in accordance with the terms of the individual loan. Loans held for sale are carried at fair value, as Newmark has elected the fair value option. The primary reasons Newmark has elected to account for loans backed by commercial real estate under the fair value option are to better offset the change in fair value of the loan and the change in fair value of the derivative instruments used as economic hedges.
Derivative Financial Instruments:
Newmark has loan commitments to extend credit to third parties. The commitments to extend credit are for mortgage loans at a specific rate (rate lock commitments). These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require a fee. Newmark is committed to extend credit to the counterparty as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment contracts.
Newmark simultaneously enters into a commitment to deliver such mortgages to third-party investors at a fixed price (a Forward Sales Contract).
Mortgage Servicing Rights, Net:
107
Newmark initially recognizes and measures the rights to service originated mortgage loans at fair value and subsequently measures them using the amortization method. Newmark recognizes rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets at the time the underlying originated mortgage loan is sold, and the value of those rights is included in the determination of the gains on loans held for sale.
Purchased MSRs, including MSRs purchased from CCRE, are initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently measured using the amortization method.
Newmark receives up to a three-basis point servicing fee and/or up to a one-basis point surveillance fee on certain Freddie Mac loans after the loan is securitized in a Freddie Mac pool. The Freddie Mac Strip is also recognized at fair value and subsequently measured using the amortization method, but is recognized as a MSR at the securitization date.
MSRs are assessed for impairment, at least on an annual basis, based upon the fair value of those rights as compared to the amortized cost. Fair values are estimated using a valuation model that calculates the present value of the future net servicing cash flows. In using this valuation method, Newmark incorporates assumptions that management believes market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. It is reasonably possible that such estimates may change. Newmark amortizes the MSRs in proportion to, and over the period of, the projected net servicing income. For purposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, Newmark stratifies MSRs based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans, primarily by investor type (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac, FHA/GNMA, CMBS and other). To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a specific MSR strata, a valuation allowance is established, which is adjusted in the future as the fair value of MSRs increases or decreases. Reversals of valuation allowances cannot exceed the previously recognized impairment up to the amortized cost.
Fixed Assets, net:
Fixed assets are carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

Fixed assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Leasehold improvements and other fixed assets
shorter of the remaining term of lease or useful life
Software, including software development costs
3
-
5
 years straight-line
Computer and communications equipment
3
-
5
 years straight-line
Long-Lived Assets:
Newmark periodically evaluates potential impairment of long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets, when a change in circumstances occurs, by applying the U.S. GAAP guidance, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and assessing whether the unamortized carrying amount can be recovered over the remaining life through undiscounted future expected cash flows generated by the underlying assets. If the undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge would be recorded. The impairment charge would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net:
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance on 
Intangibles—Goodwill and Other
, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are periodically tested for impairment. The Company reviews goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, Newmark first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Newmark did not recognize an impairment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Definite-lived intangible assets arising from business combinations include trademarks and trade names, non-contractual customers, license agreements, non-compete agreements, and contractual customers. Newmark did 
no
t recognize an impairment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Transfer of Financial Assets:
108
Newmark originates its commercial mortgage loans primarily for the GSEs’ distribution channels, which generally involve (a) Freddie Mac purchasing Newmark’s loans for cash, (b) Fannie Mae securitizing Newmark’s loans into a mortgage-backed security, or MBS, guaranteed by Fannie Mae, (c) FHA guaranteeing the credit risk of Newmark’s loans or (d) Ginnie Mae securitizing Newmark’s loans into an MBS. MBS are collateralized by the loan and Ginnie Mae selling the MBS for cash. As part of its origination activities, Newmark accounts for the transfer of financial assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance on 
Transfers and Servicing
. In accordance with this guidance, the transfer of financial assets between two entities must meet the following criteria for derecognition and sale accounting:
•
The transfer must involve a financial asset, group of financial assets or a participating interest;
•
The financial assets must be isolated from the transferor and its consolidated affiliates as well as its creditors;
•
The transferee or beneficial interest holders must have the right to pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and;
•
The transferor may not maintain effective control of the transferred assets.
Newmark determined that all loans sold during the periods presented met these specific conditions and accounted for all transfers of loans held for sale as completed sales.
Warehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises:
Warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises are borrowings under warehouse line agreements. The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. Outstanding borrowings against these lines are collateralized by an assignment of the underlying mortgages, reflected as loans held for sale, at fair value on Newmark’s consolidated balance sheets and third-party purchase commitments. The borrowing rates on the warehouse lines are based on short-term SOFR plus applicable margins. Accordingly, the warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The facilities are generally repaid within a 45-day period when Freddie Mac buys the loans or upon settlement of the Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities, while Newmark retains servicing rights.
Income Taxes:
Newmark accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance on 
Income Taxes
. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to basis differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of Newmark’s entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to primarily the UBT in New York City. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners, rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners’ tax liability or benefit is not reflected on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included on the accompanying consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions.
Newmark provides for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because significant assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from Newmark’s estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Newmark recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in “Provision for income taxes” on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, Newmark considers all available evidence, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.
The measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws and involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. Because Newmark’s interpretation of complex tax law may impact the measurement of current and deferred income taxes, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions regarding the application of tax law.
Equity-Based and Other Compensation:
Equity-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the fair value of the portion of equity-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest. The grant-date fair value of equity-based awards is amortized to 
109
expense ratably over the awards’ vesting periods. As equity-based compensation expense recognized in the Newmark’s consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reviewed for estimated forfeitures. Further, forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Restricted Stock Units:
RSUs are accounted for as equity awards and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Newmark is required to record an expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. The grant-date fair value of RSUs is amortized to expense ratably over the awards’ expected vesting periods. The amortization is reflected as a component of compensation expense under “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Limited Partnership Units:
Limited partnership units in BGC Holdings were, prior to the Corporate Conversion, and Newmark Holdings are, held by Newmark employees and receive quarterly allocations of net income and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. The quarterly allocations of net income on such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Certain of these limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and, prior to the Corporate Conversion, BGC Holdings, such as REUs, entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder’s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that Newmark record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in the Newmark’s consolidated statements of operations as part of “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.” The liability for limited partnership units held by Newmark employees with a post-termination payout amount is included in “Other long-term liabilities” on the Newmark’s consolidated balance sheets.
Certain limited partnership units held by Newmark employees are granted exchangeability into Class A common stock or may be redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of Class A common stock. At the time exchangeability is granted, or the shares are issued, Newmark recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
In addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain limited partnership units, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder upon such exchange. Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings, prior to the Corporate Conversion, and Newmark Holdings are allocated to such units at a rate of either 
0.6875
% (which is 
2.75
% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the Preferred Distribution, which is deducted before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining limited partnership interests. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into BGC or Newmark Class A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they are not included in Newmark’s fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are reflected in compensation expense under “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Redeemable Partnership Interests:
Redeemable partnership interest represents limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings held by Founding/Working Partners. (See Note 2 — “Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings” for additional information related to redeemable partnership interest).
Noncontrolling Interests:
Noncontrolling interests represent third-party, Cantor’s and BGC’s (prior to the Spin-Off) ownership interests on the accompanying consolidated subsidiaries and are included on Newmark’s consolidated balance sheets. Prior to the Spin-Off, Cantor and BGC units received allocations of net income (loss). Subsequent to the Spin-Off, Cantor Units received allocations of net income (loss). Allocations of net income (loss) are reflected as a component of “Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

113.0
 million in total fair value comprising cash of $
101.2
 million and contingent consideration of $
11.9
 million. The excess of the consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill of $
75.6
 million, of which approximately $
54.8
 million was deductible by Newmark for tax purposes as of December 31, 2023.
This acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The results of operations of the acquisition have been included on the accompanying consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of acquisition, which in aggregate contributed $
91.6
 million to Newmark’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Earnings Per Share and Weighted-Average Shares Outstanding
U.S. GAAP guidance —
 Earnings (Loss) Per Share
 provides guidance on the computation and presentation of earnings (loss) per share. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and contingent shares for which all necessary conditions have been satisfied except for the passage of time. Net income (loss) is allocated to Newmark’s outstanding common stock, FPUs, limited partnership units and Cantor Units (see Note 2 — “Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings

and BGC Holdings”).
The following is the calculation of Newmark’s basic EPS (in thousands, except per share data):

Fully diluted EPS is calculated utilizing net income (loss) available to common stockholders plus net income allocations to the limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings as the numerator. The denominator comprises Newmark’s weighted-average number of outstanding shares of Newmark Common Stock and, if dilutive, the weighted-average number of limited partnership interests and other contracts to issue shares of common stock, stock options and RSUs. The limited partnership interests generally are potentially exchangeable into shares of Newmark Class A common stock and are entitled to 
111
remaining earnings after the deduction for the Preferred Distribution; as a result, they are included in the fully diluted EPS computation to the extent that the effect would be dilutive.

Investments
Newmark had a 
27
% ownership in Real Estate LP, a joint venture with Cantor in which Newmark had the ability to exert significant influence over the operating and financial policies. Accordingly, Newmark had accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Newmark recognized equity income of $
14.2
 million and $
2.8
 million, respectively. Equity income (loss) is included in “Other income (loss), net” on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. On July 20, 2022, Newmark exercised its redemption option. In December 2022, the Audit Committee authorized a subsidiary of Newmark to rescind its July 20, 2022 written notice exercising the optional redemption of its 
27
% ownership interest in Real Estate LP and amended the joint venture agreement between 
113
Newmark and Real Estate LP to provide for a redemption option for this investment after July 1, 2023, with proceeds to be received within 
20
 days of the redemption notice. A payment of a $
44.0
 thousand administrative fee was made to Newmark in connection with such amendment. Newmark exercised its redemption option and received payment of $
105.5
 million from Cantor during the year ended December 31, 2023, terminating Newmark’s interest in Real Estate LP. There was no additional gain recognized on the exercise and receipt of payment.
Investments Carried Under Measurement Alternatives
Newmark has acquired investments in entities for which it does not have the ability to exert significant influence over operating and financial policies.
Newmark did 
not
 recognize realized gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Newmark recognized realized losses related to these investments of $
14.1
 million. Newmark did 
not
 recognize unrealized gains (losses) related to these investments for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022. Newmark recognized unrealized losses related to these investments of $
3.8
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The changes in value are included as a part of “Other income (loss), net” on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, the Company invested $
0.3
 million, $
0.0 million
 and $
2.7
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The carrying values of these investments were $
5.2
 million and $
4.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included in “Other assets” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
(8)    
Capital and Liquidity Requirements
Newmark is subject to various capital requirements in connection with seller/servicer agreements that Newmark has entered into with the various GSEs. Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in Newmark’s inability to originate and service loans for the respective GSEs and could have a direct material adverse effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Management believes that, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Newmark had met all capital requirements. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the most restrictive capital requirement was the net worth requirement of Fannie Mae. Newmark exceeded the minimum requirement by $
370.2
 million and $
409.2
 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.                                    
Certain of Newmark’s agreements with Fannie Mae allow Newmark to originate and service loans under the Fannie Mae DUS program. These agreements require Newmark to maintain sufficient collateral to meet Fannie Mae’s restricted and operational liquidity requirements based on a pre-established formula. Certain of Newmark’s agreements with Freddie Mac allow Newmark to service loans under the Freddie Mac TAH. These agreements require Newmark to pledge sufficient collateral to meet Freddie Mac’s liquidity requirement o
f 
8
%
 o
f the outstanding principal of Freddie Mac TAH loans serviced by Newmark. Management believes that, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Newmark had met all liquidity requirements.
In addition, as a servicer for Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and FHA, Newmark is required to advance to investors any uncollected principal and interest due from borrowers. Outstanding borrower advances were $
0.5
 million and $
1.6
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included in “Other assets” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
(9)    
Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value
Loans held for sale, at fair value represent originated loans that are typically financed by short-term warehouse facilities (see Note 18 — “Warehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises”) and sold within 
45
 days from the date the mortgage loan is funded. Newmark initially and subsequently measures all loans held for sale at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The fair value measurement falls within the definition of a Level 2 measurement (significant other observable inputs) within the fair value hierarchy. Electing to use fair value allows a better offset of the change in the fair value of the loans and the change in fair value of the derivative instruments used as economic hedges. 
Loans held for sale had a cost basis and fair value as follows (in thousands):

Mae mortgage-backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans. As of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there we
re 
no
 lo
ans held for sale that were 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status.
Newmark records interest income on loans held for sale, in accordance with the terms of the individual loans, during the period prior to sale. Interest income on loans held for sale is included in “Management services, servicing fees and other” on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Gains (losses) for fair value adjustments on loans held for sale is included in “Capital markets” on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Derivatives
Newmark accounts for its derivatives at fair value and recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the portion of Spring11’s revenues associated with its servicing and asset management portfolio is no longer reported under “Management services” but is instead recorded as part of “Servicing fees” for all periods from the first quarter of 2023 onwards. For the year ended December 31, 2023, $
8.6
 million was reclassified from “Management services” to “Servicing fees.”
Disaggregation of Revenues
Newmark’s chief operating decision-maker, regardless of geographic location, evaluates the operating results, including revenues, of Newmark as total real estate services (see Note 3 — “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for further discussion).
Contract Balances
The timing of Newmark’s revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by its customers. Newmark records a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and Newmark has an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, Newmark records deferred revenue until the performance obligations are satisfied.
Newmark’s deferred revenue primarily relates to customers paying in advance or billed in advance where the performance obligation has not yet been satisfied. Deferred revenue is recorded as a contract liability. Deferred revenue at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $
1.3
 million and $
2.7
 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Newmark recognized revenue of $
1.4
 million
, 
$
1.7
 million and $
2.5
 million, respectively, that was recorded as deferred revenue at the beginning of the period. 
For Knotel and Deskeo, the Company’s remaining performance obligations that represent contracted customer revenues, that have not yet been recognized as revenue as of December 31, 2024 and that will be recognized as revenue in future periods over the life of the customer contracts in accordance with ASC 606, are approximately $
145.7
 million. Over half of the remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2024 are scheduled to be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months, with the remaining to be recognized over the remaining life of the customer contracts, which extends through 2030.

  Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the portion of Spring11’s revenues associated with its servicing and asset management portfolio is no longer         reported under “Management services” but is instead recorded as part of “Servicing fees” for all periods from the first quarter of 2023 onwards. For the year ended December 31, 2023, $
8.6
 million was reclassified from “Management services” to “Servicing fees.”
 Newmark’s primary servicing portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $
67.4
 billion and $
62.2
 billion, respectively. Newmark’s limited servicing portfolio with recorded MSRs as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $
6.5
 billion and $
10.1
 billion, respectively. Also, Newmark is the named special servicer for a number of commercial mortgage-backed securitizations. Upon certain specified events (such as, but not limited to, loan defaults and loan assumptions), the administration of the loan is transferred to Newmark. Newmark’s special servicing portfolio was $
2.5
 billion and $
2.6
 billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
The estimated fair value of the MSRs as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $
658.1
 million and $
680.6
 million, respectively.
Fair values are estimated using a valuation model that calculates the present value of the future net servicing cash flows. The cash flows assumptions used are based on assumptions Newmark believes market participants would use to value the portfolio. Significant assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing per loan, discount rate, earnings rate on escrow deposits and prepayment speeds.
The discount rates used in measuring fair value for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were between 
6.1
% and 
13.5
% and varied based on investor type. An increase in discount rate of 
100
 basis points or 
200
 basis points would result in a decrease in fair value by $
16.6
 million and $
32.5
 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024, and by $
18.1
 million and $
35.4

Leases
Newmark has operating leases for real estate and equipment. These leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 
one
 to 
eleven years
, some of which include options to extend the leases in 
one
- to 
ten-year
 increments. Renewal periods are included in the lease term only when renewal is reasonably certain, which is a high threshold and requires management to apply judgment to determine the appropriate lease term. Certain leases also include periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if Newmark is reasonably certain not to exercise the termination option. The Company measures its lease payments by including fixed rental payments and, where relevant, variable rental payments tied to an index, such as the Consumer Price Index. Payments for leases in place before the date of adoption of ASC 842, 
Leases
 were determined based on previous leases guidance. The Company recognizes lease expense for its operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease expense not included in the lease payment measurement is recognized as incurred. All leases were classified as operating leases as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Pursuant to the accounting policy election, leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet. The short-term lease expense over the period reasonably reflects the Company’s short-term lease commitments.
ASC 842, 
Leases
 requires the Company to make certain assumptions and judgments in applying the guidance, including determining whether an arrangement includes a lease, determining the term of a lease when the contract has renewal or cancellation provisions, and determining the discount rate.
The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease or includes a lease at the contract inception by evaluating whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, and can direct the use of, the identified asset for a period of time, the Company accounts for the identified asset as a lease. The Company has elected the 
119
practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all leases other than real estate leases. The primary non-lease component that is combined with a lease component represents operating expenses such as utilities, maintenance or management fees.
As the rate implicit in the lease is not usually available, the Company used an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date of the new ASC 842, 
Leases
 standard in determining the present value of lease payments for existing leases. The Company has elected to use a portfolio approach for the incremental borrowing rate, applying corporate bond rates to the leases. The Company calculated the appropriate rates with reference to the lease term and lease currency. The Company uses information available at the lease commencement date to determine the discount rate for any new leases.
Total lease liability as of December 31, 2024 was $
598.3
 million. Of the total amount, $
151.1
 million of lease liability was within our flexible workspace business whereby the liability was in consolidated SPVs with only $
22.6
 million of guarantees and/or letters of credit with exposure to Newmark. There was an additional $
10.2

158.2
 million. 
Total lease liability as of December 31, 2023 was $

As of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Newmark did not have any leases that have not yet commenced but that create significant rights and obligations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Newmark had short-term lease expense of $
0.6

On November 6, 2018, Newmark closed its offering of $

 million aggregate principal amount of 
6.125
% Senior Notes due November 15, 2023. The 
6.125
% Senior Notes were priced on November 1, 2018 at 
98.94
% to yield 
6.375
%. The 
6.125
% Senior Notes were offered and sold by Newmark in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. The 
6.125
% Senior Notes were subsequently exchanged for notes with substantially similar terms that were registered under the Securities Act. The 
6.125
% Senior Notes bore an interest rate of 
6.125
% per annum, payable on each May 15 and November 15, beginning on May 15, 2019, and matured on November 15, 2023, and were repaid prior to December 31, 2023.
On August 10, 2023, Newmark entered into a Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement to repay a portion of the principal and interest related to the Company’s $
550.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
6.125
% Senior Notes. On November 15, 2023, Newmark repaid $
566.8
 million, including interest of $
16.8
 million, of 
6.125
% Senior Notes using $
420.0
 million of proceeds from the Delayed Draw Term Loan and $
130.0
 million of proceeds from the Credit Facility. See further discussion in the “Delayed Draw Term Loan” section below.
Newmark uses the effective interest rate method to amortize debt discounts and uses the straight-line method to amortize debt issue costs over the life of the notes. 
Interest expense, amortization of debt issue costs and amortization of the debt discount of the

7.500
% Senior Notes
On January 12, 2024, Newmark closed its offering of $
600.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
7.500
% Senior Notes. The notes are general senior unsecured obligations of Newmark. The 
7.500
% Senior Notes were offered and sold in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. Customary registration rights were provided to purchasers of the 
7.500
% Senior Notes. Newmark subsequently held an exchange offer pursuant to which eligible holders of the 
7.500
% Senior Notes were able to exchange their 
7.500
% Senior Notes for notes with substantially identical terms that were registered under the Securities Act. The notes bear interest at a rate of 
7.500
% per year, payable in cash on January 12 and July 12 of each year, commencing July 12, 2024. The 
7.500
% Senior Notes will mature on January 12, 2029. The Company received net proceeds from the initial offering of the 
7.500
% Senior Notes of approximately $
594.7
 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and estimated offering expenses. The Company used the net proceeds to repay all of the $
420.0
 million then-outstanding under its Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement. Additional net proceeds were used to repay all $
130.0
 million of then outstanding revolving debt under the Cantor Credit Agreement. In connection with this issuance of 
7.500
% Senior Notes, the Company recorded approximately $
0.5
 million in underwriting fees payable to CF&Co. These fees were recorded as a deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, which is amortized as interest expense over the term of the notes. Cantor, which was not eligible to participate in the exchange offer, purchased $
125.0
 million aggregate principal amount of such senior notes.
The carrying amount of the

Delayed Draw Term Loan
On August 10, 2023, Newmark entered into a Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement, by and among the Company, the several financial institutions from time to time party thereto, as Lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (as such terms are defined in the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement), pursuant to which the Lenders committed to provide to the Company a senior unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $
420.0
 million, which could be increased, subject to certain terms and conditions, to up to $
550.0
 million. The proceeds of the Delayed Draw Term Loan could only be used to repay the 
6.125
% Senior Notes at their maturity. The Delayed Draw Term Loan had a maturity date of November 14, 2026. 
As set forth in the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Delayed Draw Term Loan could bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either (a) Term SOFR for interest periods of one or three months (as selected by the Company) or upon the consent of all Lenders, such other period that is 12 months or less (in each case, subject to availability), as selected by the Company, plus an applicable margin or (b) a base rate equal to the greatest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 
0.50
%, (ii) the prime rate as established by the Administrative Agent, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 
1.00
%, in each case plus an applicable margin. Upon funding, the applicable margin was 
2.625
% with respect to Term SOFR borrowings in (a) above and 
1.625
% with respect to base rate borrowings in (b) above. Depending on the Company’s credit ratings, the applicable margin could range, with respect to Term SOFR borrowings, from 
2.125
% to 
3.375
% through and including August 10, 2024, and 
2.5
% to 
3.875
% thereafter; and base rate borrowings, from 
1.125
% to 
2.375
% through and including August 10, 2024, and 
1.5
% to 
2.875
% thereafter.
The Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement contained financial covenants with respect to minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratio. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement also contained certain other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The covenants in the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement were consistent with those within the Company’s existing $
600.0
 million Credit Facility, which remains available to the Company.
On November 8, 2023, Newmark provided notice to Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, to borrow the $
420.0
 million available under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement with the funds made available on November 14, 2023. The Company used the $
420.0
 million of proceeds of the Delayed Draw Term Loan draw to pay a portion of the matured principal and interest of the Company’s $
550.0
 million 
6.125
% Senior Notes due November 15, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, there was an outstanding balance of $
420.0
 million on the Delayed Draw Term Loan. On January 12, 2024, the outstanding balance under the Delayed Draw Term Loan was repaid with the proceeds of the offering of the 
7.500
% Senior Notes. The Delayed Draw Term Loan was terminated and the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of $
2.7
 million were expensed.

Debt Repurchase Program
On June 16, 2020, the Board and Audit Committee authorized a debt repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $
50.0
 million of Company debt securities.
As of December 31, 2024, Newmark had $
50.0
 million remaining under its debt repurchase authorization.
Credit Facility
On November 28, 2018, Newmark entered into the Credit Agreement by and among Newmark, the several financial institutions from time to time party thereto, as lenders, and Bank of America N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provided for a $
250.0
 million 
three-year
 unsecured senior revolving credit facility. 
On February 26, 2020, Newmark entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement, increasing the size of the Credit Facility to $
425.0
 million and extending the maturity date to February 26, 2023. The annual interest rate on the Credit Facility was reduced to 
LIBOR
 plus 
1.75
%, subject to a pricing grid linked to Newmark’s credit ratings from S&P Global Ratings and Fitch. 
On March 16, 2020, Newmark entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement, increasing the size of the Credit Facility to $
465.0
 million. The annual interest rate on the Credit Facility was 
LIBOR
 plus 
1.75
%, subject to a pricing grid linked to Newmark’s credit ratings from S&P Global Ratings and Fitch. In July 2021, Newmark paid the $
140.0
 million outstanding on the Credit Facility.
On March 10, 2022, Newmark amended and restated the Credit Agreement, as amended. Pursuant to the amended and restated Credit Agreement, the lenders agreed to: (a) increase the amount available to the Company under the Credit Facility to $
600.0
 million, (b) extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility to March 10, 2025, and (c) improve pricing to 
1.50
% per annum with respect to Term 
SOFR
 (as defined in the amended and restated Credit Agreement) borrowings.
On April 26, 2024, Newmark amended and restated the Credit Agreement, which amendment and restatement, among other things, extends the maturity date of the Credit Facility to April 26, 2027. The borrowing rates and financial covenants under the Credit Agreement are substantially consistent with the Credit Agreement prior to such amendment and restatement.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either (a) Term SOFR for interest periods of one or three months, as selected by the Company, or upon the consent of all lenders, such other period that is 12 months or less (in each case, subject to availability), as selected by the Company, plus an applicable margin, or (b) a base rate equal to the greatest of (i) the 
federal funds rate
 plus 
0.50
%, (ii) the prime rate as established by the Administrative Agent (as such term is defined in the amended and restated Credit Agreement), and (iii) Term SOFR plus 
1.00
%, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin was initially 
1.50
% with respect to Term 
SOFR
 borrowings in (a) above and 
0.50
% with respect to 
base rate
 borrowings in (b) above. The applicable margin with respect to Term 
SOFR
 borrowings in (a) above could range from 
1.00
% to 
2.125
% depending upon the Company’s credit rating, and with respect to 
base rate
 borrowings in (b) above could range from 
0.00
% to 
1.125
% depending upon the Company’s credit rating. The Credit Agreement also provides for certain upfront and arrangement fees and for an unused facility fee.
As of December 31, 2024, there were $
75.0
 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2024, borrowings under the Credit Facility carried an interest rate of 
6.15
%, with a weighted-average interest rate of 
6.66
% for the 
year ended December 31, 2024
. During the 
year ended December 31, 2024, there were 
$
245.0
 million of borrowings and $
170.0
 million of repayments. As of December 31, 2023, there were 
no
 borrowings under the Credit Facility. The weighted-average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 
5.78
%. During the year ended December 31, 2023, there were $
380.0
 million of borrowings and $
380.0
 million of repayments. Repayments of $
380.0
 million includes the use of $
130.0
 million of proceeds from the Cantor Credit Agreement to repay $
130.0
 million of borrowings under the Credit Facility. Newmark uses the straight-line method to amortize debt issue costs over the life of the Credit Facility.

Cantor Credit Agreement
On November 30, 2018, Newmark entered into an unsecured credit agreement with Cantor. The Cantor Credit Agreement provides for each party to issue loans to the other party in the lender’s discretion. Pursuant to the Cantor Credit Agreement, the parties and their respective subsidiaries (with respect to Cantor, other than BGC and its subsidiaries) may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $
250.0
 million from each other from time to time at an interest rate which is the higher of Cantor or Newmark’s short-term borrowing rate then in effect, plus 
1.0
%.
On December 20, 2023, Newmark entered into a first amendment to the Cantor Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the First Cantor Credit Agreement Amendment, Cantor agreed to make certain loans to Newmark from time to time in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to $
150.0
 million under the Cantor Credit Agreement. The Newmark Revolving Loans have substantially the same terms as other loans under the Cantor Credit Agreement, except that until April 15, 2024, the Newmark Revolving Loans would bear interest at a rate equal to 
25
 basis points less than the interest rate borne by the revolving loans made pursuant to the Credit Facility. Unlike other loans made under the Cantor Credit Agreement, Cantor may demand repayment of the Newmark Revolving Loans prior to the final maturity date of the Cantor Credit Agreement upon 
three
 business days’ prior written notice. Also on December 20, 2023, Newmark drew $
130.0
 million of Newmark Revolving Loans, and used the proceeds to repay the $
130.0
 million balance then outstanding under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, there were $
130.0
 million of borrowings outstanding under the Cantor Credit Agreement. On January 12, 2024, the outstanding balance under the Cantor Credit Agreement was repaid with the proceeds of the offering of the 
7.500
% Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2024, there was 
no
 outstanding balance under the Cantor Credit Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the agreements described above, Newmark is required to meet several financial covenants. Newmark was in compliance with all such covenants as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
(20)    
Financial Guarantee Liability
Newmark shares risk of loss for loans originated under the Fannie Mae DUS and Freddie Mac TAH programs and could incur losses in the event of defaults under or foreclosure of these loans. Under the loss-share guarantee, Newmark’s maximum contingent liability to the extent of actual losses incurred is approximately 
33
% of the outstanding principal balance on Fannie Mae DUS or Freddie Mac TAH loans. Risk-sharing percentages are established on a loan-by-loan basis when originated, with most loans at 
33
% and “modified” loans at lower percentages. Under certain circumstances, risk-sharing percentages can be revised subsequent to origination or Newmark could be required to repurchase the loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a catastrophic event that is not required to be covered by borrowers’ insurance policies, Newmark can recover the loss under its mortgage impairment insurance policy. Any potential recovery is subject to the policy’s deductibles and limits. 
At December 31, 2024, the credit risk loans being serviced by Newmark on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had outstanding principal balances of $
32.1
 billion with a maximum potential loss of approximately $
10.0
 billion. At December 31, 2023, the credit risk loans being serviced by Newmark on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had outstanding principal balances of approximately $
29.1
 billion with a maximum potential loss of approximately $
9.0
 billion.
Newmark’s current estimate of expected credit losses considers various factors, including, without being limited to, historical default and losses, current delinquency status, loan size, terms, amortization types, the forward-looking view of the primary risk drivers (debt-service coverage ratio and loan-to-value) based on forecasts of economic conditions and local market performance. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were increases (decreases) in the provision for expected credit losses of ($
1.9
 million), $
2.6
 million and $
1.7
 million, respectively. A loan is considered to be delinquent once it is 
60
 days past due. 
As of December 31, 2024, there was 
one
 loan in foreclosure that had an outstanding principal balance of $
5.1
 million, with a maximum loss exposure of $
1.7
 million. Advances for principal, interest and maintenance costs to be used for the loss calculation are $
2.1
 million
. 
Proceeds from the liquidation of the asset was estimated to be approximately $
6.1
 million based on current estimate of fair value. Newmark’s share of the loss was estimated at $
0.2
 million. 
D
uring the year ended December 31, 
125
2024, Newmark settled its share of the loss on one credit risk loan for $
0.3
 million that was in foreclosure as of December 31, 2023.
As of December 31, 2023, there was 
one
 loan in foreclosure that had an outstanding principal balance of $
7.3
 million, with a maximum loss exposure of $
2.4
 million. Proceeds from the liquidation of the asset was estimated to be approximately $
7.5
 million based on estimate of fair value at December 31, 2023. Newmark’s share of the loss would approximate $
0.5
 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Newmark settled the loss on one credit risk loan for $
1.2
 million that was in foreclosure as of December 31, 2022 and wrote off $
0.6
 million of servicing advances.

Concentrations of Credit Risk
The lending activities of Newmark create credit risk in the event that counterparties do not fulfill their contractual payment obligations. In particular, Newmark is exposed to credit risk related to the Fannie Mae DUS and Freddie Mac TAH loans (see Note 20 — “Financial Guarantee Liability”). As of December 31, 2024, 
18
% and 
13
% of $
10.0
 billion of the maximum loss was for properties located in California and Texas, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, 
20
% and 
12
% of $
9.0
 billion of the maximum loss was for properties located in California and Texas, respectively.
(22)    
Escrow and Custodial Funds
In conjunction with the servicing of multifamily and commercial loans, Newmark holds escrow and other custodial funds. Escrow funds are held at unaffiliated financial institutions generally in the form of cash and cash equivalents. These funds amounted to $
1.5
 billion and $
1.1
 billion, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These funds are held for the benefit of Newmark’s borrowers and are segregated in custodial bank accounts. These amounts are excluded from the assets and liabilities of Newmark.
(23)    
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
U.S. GAAP guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
•
Level 1 measurements—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2 measurements—Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
•
Level 3 measurements—Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
As required by U.S. GAAP guidance, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
The following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under U.S. GAAP guidance (in thousands):

Valuation Processes 
–
 Level 3 Measurements
Both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the Forward Sales Contracts to investors are derivatives and, accordingly, are marked to fair value on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of Newmark’s rate lock commitments to borrowers and loans held for sale and the related input levels includes, as applicable:
•
The assumed gain or loss of the expected loan sale to the investor, net of employee benefits;
•
The expected net future cash flows associated with servicing the loan;
•
The effects of interest rate movements between the date of the rate lock and the balance sheet date; and
128
•
The nonperformance risk of both the counterparty and Newmark.
The fair value of Newmark’s Forward Sales Contracts to investors considers effects of interest rate movements between the trade date and the balance sheet date. The market price changes are multiplied by the notional amount of the Forward Sales Contracts to measure the fair value.
The fair value of Newmark’s rate lock commitments and Forward Sales Contracts is adjusted to reflect the risk that the agreement will not be fulfilled. Newmark’s exposure to nonperformance in rate lock and Forward Sales Contracts is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Given the credit quality of Newmark’s counterparties, the short duration of rate lock commitments and Forward Sales Contracts, and Newmark’s historical experience with the agreements, management does not believe the risk of nonperformance by Newmark’s counterparties to be significant.
The fair value of Newmark’s contingent consideration is based on the discount rate of the Company’s calculated-average cost of capital, as well as the probability of acquirees meeting earnout targets.
Information About Uncertainty of Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value of Newmark’s contingent consideration are the discount rate and probability of meeting earnout and contingencies. Significant increases (decreases) in the discount rate would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Significant increases (decreases) in the probability of meeting earnout and contingencies would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the present value of expected payments related to Newmark’s contingent consideration was $
21.9
 million and $
25.7
 million, respectively (see Note 28 — “Commitments and Contingencies”). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the undiscounted value of the payments, assuming that all contingencies are met, would be $
25.3
 million and $
35.9
 million, respectively. 
Fair Value Measurements on a Non-Recurring Basis
Equity investments carried under the measurement alternative are remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis to reflect observable transactions which occurred during the period. Newmark applied the measurement alternative to equity securities with the fair value of $
5.2
 million and $
4.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was included in “Other assets” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These investments are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because their estimated fair value is based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date.

held by the Company and the strong balance sheet and significant amount of income created from this. A principal reason for structuring the bonus award with a substantial portion to be paid out over

1,238,620
 non-exchangeable PSUs in connection with the signing of the 2024 Gosin Employment Agreement, rather than on their previously scheduled conversion date of December 31, 2024.

7
%. In addition, the Audit Committee of the Company authorized the Company and its subsidiaries to enter into similar arrangements in respect of any jurisdiction, in the future, with Cantor and its subsidiaries, provided that the applicable agreements contain customary terms for arrangements of this type and that the mark-up charged by the party employing one or more individuals for the benefit of the other is between 
3
% and 
7.5
%, depending on the level of support required for the employed individual(s).
Transactions with CF&Co
On March 28, 2019, Newmark filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC pursuant to which CF&Co could make offers and sales of Newmark’s 
6.125
% Senior Notes in connection with ongoing market-making transactions which could have occurred from time to time. Such market-making transactions in these securities could occur in the open market or be privately negotiated at prevailing market prices at a time of resale or at related or negotiated prices. Neither CF&Co, nor any of our affiliates, had any obligation to make a market in Newmark’s securities, and CF&Co or any such other affiliate could discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice. Newmark did not receive any proceeds from market-making activities in these securities by CF&Co (or any of its affiliates). This registration statement expired in March 2022. On March 25, 2022, Newmark filed a new registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was effective upon filing, to replace the one that was expiring. The 
6.125
% Senior Notes to which this registration statement on Form S-3 related matured on November 15, 2023.
On August 8, 2024, Newmark filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was effective upon filing, pursuant to which CF&Co may make offers and sales of Newmark’s 
7.500
% Senior Notes in connection with ongoing market-making transactions which may occur from time to time. Such market-making transactions in these securities may occur in the open market or be privately negotiated at prevailing market prices at a time of resale or at related or negotiated prices. Neither CF&Co, nor any of our affiliates, has any obligation to make a market in Newmark’s securities, and CF&Co or any such other affiliate may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice. Newmark does not receive any proceeds from market-making activities in these securities by CF&Co (or any of its affiliates).
Placement Agent Authorization with CF&Co
    On August 8, 2023, the Audit Committee authorized Newmark to engage CF&Co as a non-exclusive placement agent on behalf of Newmark or its subsidiaries in connection with certain capital markets transactions (with the ability to also 
134
mandate certain third-party banks as additional advisors and co-placement agents alongside CF&Co), pursuant to customary terms and conditions, including percentage of proceeds, and provided the terms are no less favorable to Newmark than terms that an unaffiliated third-party investment bank would provide to Newmark in similar transactions.
Cantor Rights to Purchase Cantor Units from Newmark Holdings
Cantor has a right to purchase from Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests, with the associated exchange rights issued in reliance on the exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) thereof for transactions not involving a public offering, in the event that any Newmark Holdings Founding Partner interests that have not become exchangeable are redeemed by Newmark Holdings upon termination or bankruptcy of a Founding Partner or upon mutual consent of the general partner of Newmark Holdings and Cantor. Cantor has the right to purchase such Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests at a price equal to the lesser of (1) the amount that Newmark Holdings would be required to pay to redeem and purchase such Newmark Holdings Founding Partner interests and (2) the amount equal to (a) the number of units underlying such Founding Partner interests, multiplied by (b) the Exchange Ratio as of the date of such purchase, multiplied by (c) the then-current market price of our Class A common stock. Cantor may pay such price using cash, publicly traded shares or other property, or a combination of the foregoing. If Cantor (or the other member of the Cantor group acquiring such limited partnership interests, as the case may be) so purchases such limited partnership interests at a price equal to clause (2) above, neither Cantor nor any member of the Cantor group nor Newmark Holdings nor any other person is obligated to pay Newmark Holdings or the holder of such Founding Partner interests any amount in excess of the amount set forth in clause (2) above.
In addition, the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement provides that (1) where either current, terminating or terminated partners are permitted by us to exchange any portion of their Founding Partner units and Cantor consents to such exchangeability, we will offer to Cantor the opportunity for Cantor to purchase the same number of new exchangeable limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings at the price that Cantor would have paid for exchangeable limited partnership interests in the event we had redeemed the Founding Partner units; and (2) the exchangeable limited partnership interests to be offered to Cantor pursuant to clause (1) above would be subject to, and granted in accordance with, applicable laws, rules and regulations then in effect.
If Cantor acquires any units as a result of the purchase or redemption by Newmark Holdings of any Founding Partner interests, Cantor will be entitled to the benefits (including distributions) of the units it acquires from the date of termination or bankruptcy of the applicable Founding Partner. In addition, any such units will be exchangeable by Cantor for a number of shares of our Class B common stock or, at Cantor’s election, shares of our Class A common stock, in each case, equal to the then-current Exchange Ratio, on the same basis as the limited partnership interests held by Cantor, and will be designated as Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests when acquired by Cantor. The Exchange Ratio was initially 
one
, but is subject to adjustment as set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement and was 
0.9279
 as of December 31, 2024. This may permit Cantor to receive a larger share of income generated by our business at a less expensive price than through purchasing shares of our Class A common stock, which is a result of the price payable by Cantor to Newmark.
On April 16, 2023, Cantor purchased from Newmark Holdings an aggregate of (i) 
309,631
 exchangeable limited partnership interests for aggregate consideration of $
1.3
 million as a result of the redemption of 
309,631
 Founding Partner interests, and (ii) 
38,989
 exchangeable limited partnership interests for aggregate consideration of $
0.2
 million as a result of the exchange of 
38,989
 Founding Partner interests.
On June 30, 2023, Cantor purchased from Newmark Holdings an aggregate of 
74,026
 exchangeable limited partnership interests for aggregate consideration of $
0.3
 million as a result of the redemption of 
74,026
 Founding Partner interests.
On October 23, 2024, Cantor purchased from Newmark Holdings an aggregate of (i) 
500,617
 exchangeable limited partnership interests for aggregate consideration of $
1,824,045
 as a result of the redemption of 
500,617
 Founding Partner interests, and (ii) 
162,086
 exchangeable limited partnership interests for aggregate consideration of $
506,022
 as a result of the exchange of 
162,086
 Founding Partner interests.
Also on October 23, 2024, Cantor exercised exchange rights with respect to 
13,861
 exchangeable limited partnership interests held by it, at the then-current Exchange Ratio of 
0.9257
, for 
12,831
 shares of Class A common stock, which Newmark issued to Cantor in reliance on the exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) thereof for transactions not involving a public offering. Cantor was obligated to distribute shares of Class A common stock to certain current and former partners of Cantor to satisfy certain deferred stock distribution obligations provided to such partners (i) on April 1, 2008, and (ii) on February 14, 2012 in connection with Cantor’s payment of previous quarterly partnership 
135
distributions. Certain Cantor partners had elected to receive their distributed shares in 2008 and 2012, respectively, and others had elected to defer receipt of their shares until a future date. Cantor immediately delivered the 
12,831
 shares of Class A common stock to such a former partner in satisfaction of his deferred stock distribution rights.
As of December 31, 2024, Cantor was obligated to distribute 
7,221,277
 shares of Class A common stock to satisfy its remaining deferred stock distribution obligations.
As of December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 Founding Partner interests in Newmark Holdings remaining in which the partnership had the right to redeem or exchange and with respect to which Cantor had the right to purchase an equivalent number of Cantor Units following such redemption or exchange.
First Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Newmark Holdings
On March 10, 2023, Newmark Holdings entered into the LPA Amendment to the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement. The LPA Amendment revises certain restrictive covenants pertaining to the “Partner Obligations” and “Competitive Activity” provisions in the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement. Specifically, the LPA Amendment (i) reduces the length of the post-termination period during which a partner must refrain from soliciting or doing business with customers, soliciting employees, engaging in a “Competing Business” (as defined therein), or otherwise refraining from harming the partnership; and (ii) revises the scope of the non-compete provisions under the “Partner Obligations” and “Competitive Activity” provisions in the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement to cover “Competing Businesses” for which a partner performs the same or similar services as provided to a “Protected Affiliate” (as defined therein) and (a) involving a product, product line or type, or service of a “Protected Affiliate” within a specific geographic area, (b) involving a “Client” or a “Client Representative” (each as defined therein) of a Protected Affiliate, or (c) for which the disclosure of confidential information is likely to be inevitable. The LPA Amendment was approved by the Board of Directors and Audit and Compensation Committees.
Referral Fees to Cantor
In September 2021, the Audit Committee authorized Newmark and its subsidiaries to pay referral fees to Cantor and its subsidiaries (other than Newmark and its subsidiaries) in respect of referred business, pursuant to ordinary course arrangements in circumstances where Newmark would customarily pay referral fees to unrelated third parties and where Newmark is paying a referral fee to Cantor in an amount that is no more than the applicable percentage rate set forth in Newmark’s intra-company referral policies, as then in effect, with such fees to be at referral rates no less favorable to Newmark than would be paid to unrelated third parties.
Acquisition of Spring11 Ownership Interest from Cantor
In February 2023, Newmark’s subsidiary, Newmark S11, entered into an equity purchase agreement with CFS11, a subsidiary of Cantor, pursuant to which Newmark acquired CFS11’s 
33.78
% ownership interest in Newmark S11 LP, LLC, the joint venture that owns a controlling interest in Spring11, for a total purchase price of $
11,530,598
. CFS11’s 
33.78
% ownership in Newmark S11 LP, LLC was 
25.62
% of Spring11’s economic interest. The transaction, which also included Newmark S11 buying the remaining noncontrolling interests from other third-party owners on substantially the same terms, resulted in Newmark S11 owning 
100
% of Spring11. The CFS11 transaction was approved by the Audit Committee.
7.500
% Senior Notes
On January 12, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of $
600.0
 million principal amount of 
7.500
% Senior Notes due 2029. In connection with this issuance of 
7.500
% Senior Notes, the Company recorded approximately $
0.5
 million in underwriting fees payable to CF&Co. These fees were recorded as a deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, which is amortized as interest expense over the term of the notes. Cantor purchased $
125.0
 million aggregate principal amount of such senior notes. On August 8, 2024, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was effective upon filing, pursuant to which Cantor, or its successors, assigns, and direct and indirect transferees, may resell their 
7.500
% Senior Notes from time to time. The Company will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale of the 
7.500
% Senior Notes, and the selling security holders will pay any underwriting discounts and commissions, brokerage commissions, and transfer taxes, if any, applicable to the notes sold by them. Cantor still holds such notes as of December 31, 2024.
Services Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Europe for the Provision of Real Estate Investment Banking Services
On February 21, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Company authorized NHL, a subsidiary of Newmark, to enter into an agreement with CFE pursuant to which CFE will employ and support an individual to enhance Newmark’s capital markets platform by providing real estate investment banking services for the benefit of Newmark’s client. Under this agreement, NHL will reimburse CFE for the individual’s fully allocated costs, plus a mark-up of 
7
% and CFE will be entitled to 
10
% of revenues 
136
generated by such individual on behalf of Newmark. In addition, the Audit Committee of the Company authorized NHL to include additional individuals to perform such services on substantially the same terms; provided that, in any case, the mark-up charged for such additional individuals is between 
3.0
% and 
7.5
%, depending on the level of support required for such individuals.

Income Taxes
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on Newmark’s allocable share of its U.S. results of operations, as well as taxes payable to jurisdictions outside the U.S. In addition, certain of Newmark’s entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to primarily the UBT in New York City. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss, except for the UBT, rests with the partners, rather than the  partnership entity (see Note 2 — “Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings” for a discussion of partnership interests). Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method, as prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance for 
Income Taxes

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those 
137
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized.

Newmark has NOLs in non-U.S. jurisdictions of an approximate tax effected value of $
36.9
 million, of which $
30.4
 million has an indefinite life. The rest of the $
6.5
 million primarily consists of the Canada NOL which has a 
20
 year life. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether existing deferred tax assets will be realized. Accordingly, substantially all of the total valuation allowance of $
38.3
 million relates to certain NOLs in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Newmark’s net deferred tax asset and liability are included on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as components of “Other assets” and “Other liabilities,” respectively.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various states, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently open to examination by tax authorities in United States federal, state and local jurisdictions and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions for tax years beginning 2021, 2018 and 2021, respectively.
The Company has elected to treat taxes associated with the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) provision using the Period Cost Method and thus has not recorded deferred taxes for basis differences under this regime as of December 31, 2024. 
Pursuant to U.S. GAAP guidance on 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
, Newmark provides for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities.

Compensation
Newmark’s Compensation Committee may grant various equity-based awards to employees of Newmark, including RSUs, restricted stock, limited partnership units and shares of Newmark Class A common stock upon exchange or redemption of Newmark Holdings limited partnership units (see Note 2 — “Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings”). On December 13, 2017, as part of the Separation, the Equity Plan was approved by Newmark’s then sole stockholder, BGC, for Newmark to issue up to 
400.0
 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock which have been registered on Forms S-8.

On October 17, 2024, at the annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders approved amending and restating the Equity Plan to, among other things, increase from 
400.0
 million to 
500.0
 million the aggregate number of shares of Newmark Class A common stock that may be delivered or cash-settled pursuant to awards granted during the life of the Equity Plan. On October 18, 2024, Newmark registered an additional 
100.0
 million shares on Form S-8. As of December 31, 2024, an aggregate of 
500.0
 million shares were registered on Forms S-8. As of December 31, 2024, awards with respect to 
110.4
 million shares had been granted and 
389.6
 million shares were available for future awards under the Equity Plan. Upon vesting of RSUs, issuance of restricted stock and exchange or redemption of limited partnership units, Newmark generally issues new shares of its Class A common stock.
Prior to the Separation, BGC’s Compensation Committee granted various equity-based awards to employees of Newmark, including RSUs, restricted stock, limited partnership units and exchange rights for shares of BGC Class A common stock upon exchange of BGC Holdings limited partnership units (see Note 2 — “Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings

and BGC Holdings”).
As a result of the Separation, limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings were distributed to the holders of limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings. Each holder of BGC Holdings limited partnership interests at that time held a BGC Holdings limited partnership interest and 
0.4545
 of a corresponding Newmark Holdings limited partnership interest. 
The Exchange Ratio is the number of shares of Newmark Common Stock that a holder will receive upon exchange of one Newmark Holdings exchangeable unit. The Exchange Ratio was initially 
one
, but is subject to adjustment as set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement and was 
0.9279
 as of December 31, 2024.
As a result of a series of transactions prior to and in anticipation of the Corporate Conversion, all BGC Holdings units held by Newmark employees were redeemed or exchanged, in each case, for shares of BGC Class A common stock.

1.5
 million units were exchangeable.
(2)
As of December 31, 2024, the total Limited Partnership Units included 
2.4
 million Newmark Preferred Units.
The Limited Partnership Units table above includes both regular and Preferred Units. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution (see Note 2 — “Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings” for further information on Preferred Units). Subsequent to the Spin-Off, there are remaining partners who hold limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings who are BGC employees. Subsequent to the Spin-Off but prior to the closing of the Corporate Conversion, there were remaining partners who held limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings who are Newmark employees. These limited partnership interests represented interests that were held prior to the Newmark IPO or were distributed in connection with the Separation. Following the Newmark IPO, employees of Newmark and BGC received limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings, respectively. As a result of the Spin-Off, as the existing limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings held by BGC employees and the existing limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings held by Newmark employees were exchanged/redeemed, the related capital could be contributed to and from Cantor, respectively. The compensation expenses under GAAP related to the limited partnership interests are based on the company where the partner is employed. Therefore, compensation expenses related to the limited partnership interests of both Newmark and BGC but held by a Newmark employee are recognized by Newmark. The Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by BGC employees are included in the Newmark share count. The BGC Holdings limited partnership interests held by Newmark employees were included in the BGC share count until the Corporate Conversion.

Newmark issues RSUs to Newmark employees with the awards vesting ratably over the 
two

 vesting period into shares of Newmark Class A common stock.
(2)
    BGC RSUs historically vested over a 
two
 to 
three year
 period.

The fair value of Newmark and BGC RSUs held by Newmark employees is determined on the date of grant based on the market value (adjusted if appropriate based upon the award’s eligibility to receive dividends), and is recognized, net of the effect of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period. Newmark uses historical data, including historical forfeitures and turnover rates, to estimate expected forfeiture rates for RSUs. Each RSU is settled for 
one
 share of BGC or Newmark Class A common stock, as applicable, upon completion of the vesting period. The compensation expenses under GAAP related to the RSUs are based on the company where the employee is employed. Therefore, compensation expenses related to RSUs of both Newmark and BGC but held by a Newmark employee are recognized by Newmark.

Operating leases are related to rental payments under various non-cancelable leases principally for office space.
(2)
Warehouse facilities are collateralized by $
774.9
 million of loans held for sale, at fair value (see Note 18 – “Warehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises”), which loans were either under commitment to be purchased by Freddie Mac or had confirmed forward trade commitments for the issuance of and purchase of Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities.
(3)
Debt reflects long-term borrowings of $
675.0
 million which include $
600.0
 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 
7.500
% Senior Notes and $
75.0
 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The carrying amount of long-term debt was approximately $
670.7
 million in the aggregate, which includes $
595.7
 million under the 
7.500
% Senior Notes and $
75.0
 million under the Credit Facility. See Note 19 – “Debt.”
(4)
Reflects interest on the $
675.0
 million of long-term debt which includes $
600.0
 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 
7.500
% Senior Notes until their maturity date of January 11, 2029 and $
75.0
 million under the Credit Facility, which is assumed to be outstanding until the maturity date of the Credit Facility. Interest on the borrowings under the Credit Facility was projected using the 
SOFR
 rate plus 
160
 basis points.
(5)
Interest on the warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises was projected by using the one-month SOFR rate plus their respective additional basis points, primarily 
130
 basis points above 
SOFR
, applied to their respective outstanding balances as of December 31, 2024, through their respective maturity dates. Their respective maturity dates range from May 2025 to October 2025, while one line has an open maturity date. The notional amount of these committed and uncommitted warehouse facilities was $
3.1
 billion at December 31, 2024. See Note 18 – “Warehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises.”

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Newmark was committed to fund approximately $
0.1
 billion and $
0.4
 billion, respectively, which is the total remaining draws on construction loans originated by Newmark under the HUD 221(d) 4, 220 and 232 programs, rate locked loans that have not been funded, forward commitments, as well as the funding for Fannie Mae structured transactions. Newmark also has corresponding commitments to sell these loans to various investors as they are funded.
(b)    Contingent Payments Related to Acquisitions
Newmark completed acquisitions from 2019 through 2024 with contingent cash consideration of $
9.6
 million. The contingent equity instruments and cash liability is recorded at fair value in “Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities” on Newmark’s consolidated balance sheets. 
(c)    Contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, various legal actions are brought and are pending against Newmark and its subsidiaries in the U.S. and internationally. In some of these actions, substantial amounts are claimed. Newmark is also involved, from time to time, in reviews, examinations, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies (both formal and informal) regarding Newmark’s businesses, which may result in regulatory, civil and criminal judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. The following generally does not include matters that Newmark has pending against other parties which, if successful, would result in awards in favor of Newmark or its subsidiaries.
Employment, Competitor-Related and Other Litigation
From time to time, Newmark and its subsidiaries are involved in litigation, claims and arbitration in the U.S. and internationally, relating to various employment matters, including with respect to termination of employment, hiring of employees currently or previously employed by competitors, terms and conditions of employment and other matters. In light of the competitive nature of the real estate services industry, litigation, claims and arbitration between competitors regarding employee hiring are not uncommon.
Legal reserves are established in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance on Accounting for Contingencies, when a material legal liability is both probable and reasonably estimable. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change. The outcome of such items cannot be determined with certainty. Newmark is unable to estimate a possible loss or range of loss in connection with specific matters beyond its current accrual and any other amounts disclosed. Management believes that, based on currently available information, the final outcome of these current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on Newmark’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures taken as a whole.
Risks and Uncertainties
Newmark generates revenues by providing financial intermediary and brokerage activities and commercial real estate services to institutional customers. Revenues for these services are transaction-based. As a result, revenues could vary based on 
143
the transaction volume of global financial and real estate markets. Additionally, financing is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which could have an impact on Newmark’s overall profitability.
(29)    
Subsequent Events
On February 13, 2025, Newmark declared a qualified quarterly dividend of $
0.03
 per share payable on March 17, 2025, to Class A and Class B common stockholders of record as of March 3, 2025, which is the same as the ex-dividend date.
On February 18, 2025, Mr. Howard W. Lutnick was confirmed by the United States Senate as the 41st Secretary of Commerce. Following his confirmation, on February 18, 2025, Mr. Howard W. Lutnick stepped down as Chairman of the Board and Executive Chairman of the Company. On February 18, 2025, the Company appointed Mr. Kyle Lutnick, son of Mr. Howard W. Lutnick, to serve as a member of the Board. Additionally, on February 18, 2025 the Company appointed Mr. Stephen M. Merkel to serve as a member of the Board and as Chairman of the Board. On February 18, 2025, the Company appointed its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Barry M. Gosin, as Principal Executive Officer of the Company following Mr. Howard W. Lutnick’s departure. Mr. Howard W. Lutnick has agreed to divest his interests in Newmark to comply with U.S. government ethics rules, which is expected to occur within 90 days following his confirmation, and does not expect any arrangement which involves selling shares on the open market.
On March 1, 2025, the Company extended its headquarter lease in New York City through August of 2042.
