, Business Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

EFT Processing Segment

Overview

Our EFT Processing Segment provides comprehensive electronic payment solutions consisting of ATM cash withdrawal and deposit services, ATM network participation, outsourced ATM and POS management solutions, credit, debit and prepaid card outsourcing, card issuing and merchant acquiring services. In addition to our core business, we offer a variety of value-added services, including ATM and POS DCC, domestic and international surcharge, foreign currency dispensing, advertising, digital content sales at ATMs, Customer Relationship Management ("CRM"), prepaid mobile top-up, bill payment, money transfer, fraud management, foreign remittance payout, cardless payout, banknote recycling solutions and tax-refund services. We provide these services either through our Euronet-owned ATMs and POS terminals, through contracts under which we operate ATMs and POS terminals on behalf of our customers or, for certain services, as stand-alone products. Through this segment, we also offer a suite of integrated electronic financial transaction software solutions for electronic payment and transaction delivery systems. 

Sources of Revenues

The primary sources of revenues generated by our ATM network are recurring monthly management fees, transaction-based fees, surcharges, and margins earned on DCC transactions. We receive fixed monthly fees under many of our outsourced management contracts. The EFT Processing Segment also generates revenues from POS operations and merchant management, card network management for credit, debit, prepaid and loyalty cards, prepaid mobile airtime recharge and other electronic content on ATMs and ATM advertising. We primarily operate across Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the United States. As of

 December 31, 2024
, we operated 
55,248
 ATMs compared to 
47,303
 at

 December 31,

2023
.

We monitor the number of transactions made by cardholders on our network. These include cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, deposits, prepaid mobile airtime recharge purchases, DCC transactions and certain denied (unauthorized) transactions. We do not bill certain transactions on our network to financial institutions, and we have excluded these transactions for reporting purposes. The number of transactions processed over our netw
orks has increased over the last 
five
 years at a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of approximately

36.7%
 as indicated in the following table:

 EFT Processing Segment transactions per year

4,366

8,473

11,424

The increase in transactions for the past few years is the result of a significant increase in the volume of lower value, real time payment processing transactions on any wallet or e-commerce site in Asia Pacific. The associated revenue of these lower value, digitally initiated payment processing transactions is lower. As a result, our revenue growth will not correlate proportionately with the increase in our transaction volume growth.

Our processing centers for the EFT Processing Segment are located in 

 Germany, Hungary, India, China, Indonesia and Pakistan. Our processing centers run 
two
 types of proprietary transaction switching software:
 our legacy ITM software, which we have used and sold to financial institutions since 
1998
 through our Software Solutions unit, and an innovative switching software package named "Ren", which is hosted in Germany, India and Indonesia, that was released in 
2019
. The processing centers operate

24
 hours a day, 
seven
 days a week. We have been progressively transitioning all of our networks to Ren. 

EFT Processing Products and Services

Outsourced Management Solutions

Euronet offers outsourced management solutions to financial institutions, merchants, mobile phone operators and other organizations using our processing centers' electronic financial transaction processing software. Our outsourced management solutions include management of existing ATM networks, development of new ATM networks, management of POS networks, 

management of automated deposit terminals, management of credit, debit and prepaid card databases and other financial processing services. These solutions include 
24
-hour monitoring of each ATM's status and cash condition, managing the cash levels in each ATM, coordinating the cash delivery, and providing automatic dispatches for necessary service calls. We also provide real-time transaction authorization, advanced monitoring, network gateway access, network switching, 
24
-hour customer service, maintenance, cash settlement and reconciliation, forecasting, and reporting. Since our infrastructure can support a significant increase in transactions, new outsourced management solutions agreements should provide additional revenue with lower incremental cost.

Our outsourced management solutions agreements generally provide for fixed monthly management fees and, in most cases, fees payable for each transaction. The transaction fees under these agreements are generally lower than those under card acceptance agreements.

Euronet-Branded ATM Transaction Processing

Our Euronet-branded ATM networks, also known as IAD networks, are primarily managed by a processing center that uses our market-leading internally developed software solutions. The ATMs in our IAD networks are able to process transactions for holders of credit, debit and prepaid products issued by or bearing the logos of financial institutions and international card organizations such as American Express
®
, Visa
®
, Mastercard
®
, JCB, Diners Club International
®
, Discover
®

 and UnionPay International
©
, as well as international ATM networks such as PLUS, CIRRUS and PULSE
®
 or domestic networks such as NYCE, Shazam, AFFN, STAR and others across North America. This is accomplished through our agreements and relationships with these institutions, international credit, debit and prepaid card issuers, international card associations and domestic card associations.

3

When a bank cardholder conducts
 a transaction on a Euronet-owned ATM or auto
mated deposit 
terminal, we receive a fee from the cardholder's bank for that transaction. The bank pays us this fee either directly or indirectly through a central switching and settlement network. When paid indirectly, this fee is referred to as the "interchange fee." We receive transaction processing fees for successful transactions and, in certain circumstances, for transactions that are not complete
d because they fail to receive authorization. The fees paid to us by the card issuers are independent of any fees charged by the card issuers to cardholders in connection with the ATM transactions. In some cases, we may 
also charge a direct access fee or surcharge to cardholders at the ATM. The direct access fee is added to the amount of the cash withdrawal and debited from the cardholder's account.

We generally receive fees or earn margins from our customers for all types of ATM transactions:

Card Acceptance or Sponsorship Agreements

Our agreements with financial institutions and international card organizations generally provide that all credit and debit cards issued by the financial institution or organization may be used at all

ATMs

that we operate in for a given market. In most markets, we operate under sponsorship by our own e-money or payment service licensed entities. In some markets, we have agreements with a financial institution under w
hich

we are designated as a service provider (which we refer to as "sponsorship agreements") for the acceptance of domestic cards and/or cards bearing international logos, such as Visa
®
 and 
Mastercard
®
. These card acceptance or sponsorship agreements allow us to receive transaction authorization directly from the card issuing institution or international card organizations on a stand-in basis. Our agreements generally provide for a term of 
three
 to 
seven
 years and renew automatically unless either party p
rovides

notice of non-renewal prior to the termination date. In some cases, the agreements are terminable by either party upon 
six
 months' notice. We are generally able to connect a financial institution to our network within 
30
 to 
90
 days of signing a card acceptance agreement. The financial institution provides the cash needed to complete transactions on the ATM, but we provide a significant portion of the cash to our IAD network to fund ATM transactions ourselves.

Euronet

is generally liable for the cash in the ATM networks.

Under our card acceptance agreements, the ATM transaction fees we charge vary depending on the type of transaction and the number of transactions attributable to a particular card issuer. Our agreements generally provide for payment in local currency, though transaction fees are sometimes denominated in euros or U.S. dollars
. Transaction fees are billed to financial institutions and card organizations with payment terms typically no longer than 
one
 month.

Dynamic Currency Conversion

We offer dynamic currency conversion, or DCC, over our IAD networks, ATM networks that we operate on an outsourced basis for financial institutions, and over financial institutions' ATM networks or POS devices as a stand-alone service. DCC is a feature of the underlying ATM or POS transaction that is offered to customers completing transactions using a foreign debit or 
credit card issued in a country with a currency other than the currency where the ATM or POS is located. The customer is offered a choice between completing the transaction in the local currency or in the customer's home currency via a DCC transaction. If a cardholder chooses to perform a DCC transaction, the acquirer or processor performs the foreign exchange conversion at the time that the funds are delivered at an ATM or the transactions are completed through the POS terminal, which results in a pre-defined amount of the customer's home currency being charged to their card. Alternatively, the customer may have the transaction converted by the card issuing bank, in which the amount of local currency is communicated to the card issuing bank and the card issuing bank makes the conversion to the customer's home currency.

4

When a customer chooses DCC at an ATM or POS device and Euronet acts as the acquirer or processor, we receive all or a portion of the foreign exchange margin on the conversion of the transaction. On our IAD ATMs, Euronet receives the entire foreign exchange margin. If Euronet is not the acquirer or processor of the transaction, we share the DCC revenue with the sponsor bank. On ATMs or POS devices that are operated for financial institutions, or where we offer DCC as a stand-alone service to financial institutions or merchants, we share the foreign exchange margin. The foreign exchange margin on a DCC transaction increases the amount Euronet earns from the underlying ATM or POS transaction and supports deployment of additional ATMs in new locations.

Other Products and Services

Our network of owned or operated ATMs allows for the sale of additional financial and other products or services at a low incremental cost. We have developed value-added services in addition to basic cash withdrawal and balance inquiry transactions. These value-added services include mobile top-up, fraud management, bill payment, domestic and international surcharge, CRM, foreign remittance payout, cardless payout, banknote recycling, electronic content, ticket and voucher, foreign currency withdrawal,
 advertising and tax-refund services. We are committed to the ongoing development of innovative new products and services to offer our EFT processing customers.

Euronet offers multinational merchants a Single European Payments Area ("SEPA")-compliant cross-border transaction processing solution. SEPA is an area in which all electronic payments can be made and received in euros, whether between or within national boundaries, under the same basic conditions, rights, and obligations, regardless of the location. This single, centralized
 acquiring platform enables merchants to benefit from cost savings and faster, more efficient payments transfer. Although many European countries are not members of the eurozone, our platform can serve merchants in these countries as well, through our multi-currency functionality.

S
oftware Solutions

We also offer a suite of integrated software solutions for electronic payments and transaction delivery systems. 
We generate revenues for our software products from licensing, professional services and maintenance fees for software and sales of related hardware, primarily to financial institutions around the world. 

Ren Payments Platform

Ren was built from the ground up to operate in the evolving digital payments landscape of real-time settlements and emerging forms of payment, including QR codes, PINs and biometrics. 
Ren primarily serves financial institutions, central banks and fintech companies. It is offered as an on-premise technology where these businesses install the platform in their own data centers or as a software as a service (SaaS) offering where development teams access it in Euronet’s global data centers using APIs. 
Versatile, Ren can be used as a payment hub or to deliver core banking functionality such as issuing, merchant acquiring, transaction switching, and ATM management. For real-time payments, Ren is used by central banks to process transactions and member banks that use Ren to connect their legacy systems to real-time payment networks in their countries.

EFT Processing Segment Strategy

The EFT Processing Segment maintains a strategy to expand the network of ATMs and POS terminals into new and existing markets that have the greatest potential for growth. 
We continue to 
focus on diversifying our business by expanding our market presence and product portfolio, as well as outsourcing opportunities. 
In addition, we follow a supporting strategy to increase the penetration of value added (or complementary) services across our existing
 customer base, including DCC, transaction-based fees, surcharge, cardless payment, banknote recycling solutions, tax refund services, advertising, fraud management, bill payment, mobile top-up, CRM and foreign remittance payout. 

5

We continually strive to make our own ATM networks more efficient by removing unprofitable ATMs and redeploying them to new profitable locations. We make selective additions to our own ATM network if we see market demand and profit 
opportunities. In tourist locations, we also seasonally deactivate ATMs when tourist activity is low.

In recent years, the need for "all-in" services has increased. Banks, particularly smaller banks, are increasingly looking for integrated ATM, POS and card issuing processing and management services. Euronet is well positioned for this opportunity as it can offer a full end-to-end solution to potential partners.

Additional growth opportunities are driven through financial institution
s that are receptive to outsourcing the operation of their ATM, POS and card networks. The operation of these devices requires expensive hardware and software and specialized personnel. These resources are available to us, and we offer them to our customers under outsourcing contracts. The expansion and enhancement of our outsourced management solutions in new and existing markets will remain an important business opportunity for Euronet. Increasing the number of non-owned ATMs and POS terminals that we operate under management services agreements and continued development of our credit, debit and prepaid card outsourcing business could provide continued growth while minimizing our capital investment.

In addition, complementary services offered by our epay Segment, where we provide prepaid mobile top-up services through POS terminals, strengthens the EFT Processing Segment's line of services. We plan to continue to expand our 
technology and business methods into other markets where we operate and further leverage our relationships with mobile operators, other content providers and financial institutions to facilitate that expansion.

Seasonality

Our EFT Processing business experiences its heaviest demand for cash withdrawals and DCC during the third quarter of the fiscal year, coinciding with the tourism season. It is also impacted by seasonality during the fourth quarter and first quarter of each year due to higher transaction levels during the holiday season and lower levels after the holiday season. This seasonality is increased due to our practice of seasonally deactivating ATMs in tourist locations that experience significantly higher traffic during their peak tourist seasons. Seasonally deactivating involves shutting down the ATMs during the slower months and results in lower overall transaction volumes in the EFT Processing Segment during those months. As we have expanded our IAD network in tourist locations, the financial impact of seasonally deactivating has increased, because we continue to bear the expense of seasonally deactivated ATMs even though they do not generate transactions during the slower months.

Significant Customers and Government Contracts

No individual customer of the EFT Processing Segment makes up greater than 
10
% of total consolidated revenues. EFT 
maintains contract relationships with a number of banks, financial institutions, telecommunications companies, and clients whose ownership includes the government. 

Competition

Our principal EFT Processing Segment competitors include ATM networks owned by financial institutions and national switches consisting of consortiums of local banks that provide outsourcing and transaction services to financial institutions and independent ATM deployers in a particular country. Additionally, large, well-financed companies that operate ATMs offer ATM network and outsourcing services, and those that provide card outsourcing, POS processing and merchant acquiring services also compete with us in various markets. Small local operators have also recently begun offering their services, particularly in the IAD market. None of these competitors has a dominant market share in any of our markets. Competitive advantages in our

 EFT Processing Segment include breadth of service offering, network availability and response time, price to both the financial institution and to its customers, ATM location and access to other networks.

epay Segment

Overview

We currently process and distribute prepaid mobile airtime and other electronic content and payment processing services for various prepaid products, cards, and services on a network of approximately 
777,000
 POS terminals 
across approximately 
362,000

retailer 
locations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific, North America and South America. Our processing centers for the epay segment are located in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and the United States.

We have continued to expand our prepaid business in new and existing markets by drawing upon our depth of 
experience to build and expand relationships with content providers, mobile operators, and retailers. We offer 
a wide range of products across our retail networks, including prepaid mobile airtime, prepaid debit cards, prepaid gift cards, other prepaid electronic content such as music, games and software, prepaid vouchers, transport payments and lottery, and bill payment processing assistance through partnerships with various licensed money transmitters.

Sources of Revenues

The epay Segment generates commissions and processing fees from the distribution of electronic content from mobile operators and other content providers. 
In

2024
, approximately 
68
% 
of total revenues and approximately 
76
% 
of gross profit for the epay Segment was from electronic content other than prepaid mobile airtime (digital media products).

Customers purchase digital media prepaid content as a gift or for self-use. Content is generally purchased in 
two
 ways: (
1
) directly 
online from the content provider using an online payment method, or (
2
) through physical retail stores, online retailers, or other electronic channels, including payment wallets, online banking, mobile applications, and other sources.

Customers using mobile phones generally pay for usage in 
one
 of 
two
 ways: (
1
) through
 "postpaid" accounts, where usage is billed at the end of each billing period, or (
2
) through "prepaid" accounts, where customers pay in advance by crediting their accounts prior to usage.

Although mobile operators in the U.S. and certain European countries have provided service principally through postpaid accounts, the norm in many other countries in Europe and the rest of the world is to offer wire
less service on a prepaid basis.

Prepaid mobile phone credits are generally distributed using personal identification numbers ("PINs"). We distribute PINs in 
two
 ways. 

First, we establish an electronic connection to the mobile operator and the retailer. 

When the sale to a customer is initiated, the terminal requests the PIN from the mobile operator via our transaction processing platform. 

These transactions obtain the PIN directly from the mobile operator. 

The customer pays the retailer, and the retailer becomes obligated to make settlement to us of the purchased amount of the mobile airtime.

 We maintain systems that know the amount of mobile top-up sold by the retailer which allows us in turn to bill that retailer for the mobile top-up sold.

Second, we purchase PINs from the mobile operator which are electronically sent to our processing platform. 

We establish an electronic connection with the POS terminals in retailer locations and our processing platform provides the terminal with a PIN when the mobile top-up is purchased. 

We maintain systems that monitor transaction levels at each terminal. 

As sales of prepaid mobile airtime to customers are completed, the inventory on the platform is reduced by the PIN purchased.

 The customer payment and settlement with the retailer are the same as described above.

We expand our distribution networks by signing new contracts with retailers, and in some markets, by acquiring existing networks. We continue to focus on growing our distribution network through independent sales organizations that contract directly with retailers in their network to distribute prepaid mobile airtime or other digital media content from the retailers' POS terminals. We continue to increase our focus on direct relationships with chains of supermarkets, convenience stores, gas stations, and other larger scale retailers, where we can negotiate multi-year agreements with the retailers. 
In addition to the sale of traditional mobile top-up volume described above, we have expanded distribution into digital media products and other value-added services. We have leveraged our existing technology infrastructure to sell digital media products, which have been sold through 
our traditional retail network and new retailer networks such as digital channels. In the U.S., most prepaid digital media content is purchased for gifting; in markets outside the U.S., consumers generally purchase prepaid digital media content for self-use.

epay Products and Services

Prepaid Mobile Airtime Transaction Processing

We process prepaid mobile airtime top-up transactions on our international POS network for 
two
 types of clients: distributors and retailers. Both types of client transactions start with a consumer in a retail store. The retailer uses a specially programmed POS terminal in the store, the retailer's electronic cash register (ECR) system, or web-based POS device that is connected to our network to buy prepaid mobile airtime. The consumer will select a predefined amount of mobile airtime from the carrier of choice, and the retailer enters the selection into the POS terminal. The consumer will pay that amount to the retailer (in cash or other payment methods accepted by the retailer). The POS device then transmits the selected transaction to our processing center. Using the electronic connection we maintain with the mobile phone operator or drawing from our inventory of PINs, the purchased amount of mobile airtime will be either credited to the consumer's account or delivered via a PIN printed by the terminal and given to the consumer. In the case of PINs printed by the terminal, the consumer must then call the mobile phone operator's toll-free number to activate the purchased airtime to the consumer's mobile account.

One
 difference in our relationships with various retailers and distributors is the way in which we charge for our services. For distributors and certain very large retailers, we charge a processing fee. However, the majority of our transactions occur with smaller retailers. With these clients, we receive a commission or discount on each transaction that is withheld from the payments made to the mobile phone operator, and we share that commission/discount with the retailers.

Closed Loop Gift Cards

Closed loop (private-branded) gift cards are generally described as merchant-specific prepaid cards, used for purchases exclusively at a particular merchant's locations. We distribute closed loop gift cards in various categories, including dining, retail, and digital media, such as music, games, and software. Generally, the gift card is activated when a consumer loads funds (with cash, debit or credit card payment) or purchases a preloaded value gift card at a retail store location or online.

Open Loop Gift Cards

Open loop gift cards are prepaid gift cards associated with an electronic payment network (such as Visa
®
 or Mastercard
®
) and are honored at multiple, unaffiliated locations (wherever cards from these networks are generally accepted). They are not merchant-specific. We distribute and issue single-use, non-reloadable open loop gift cards carrying the 
Visa
® 
brand in our retail channels. After the consumer purchases the preloaded value gift card at a retail store location or online, the consumer must call the toll-free number on the back of the card to activate it.

Open Loop Reloadable

We distribute Visa
®
 and Mastercard
®
 issued debit cards provided by card issuers. We also manage and distribute a proprietary debit card that allows a retailer to issue its own reloadable store-branded card. Open loop reloadable cards have features similar to a bank checking account, including direct deposit, 
purchasing capability wherever a credit card is accepted, bill payment and ATM access. Fees are charged to consumers for the initial load and reload transactions, monthly account maintenance and other transactions.

Other Products and Services

Our POS network is used for the distribution of other products and services, including games and software, bill payment, lottery tickets and transportation products. Through our Cadooz subsidiary, we also distribute vouchers and physical gifts into the business-to-business ("B
2
B") channel principally for the purposes of employee and customer incentives and rewards, as well as POS promotions where physical goods are sold in large retailers. In certain locations, the terminals used for prepaid services can also be used for electronic funds transfer to process credit, debit, and prepaid card payments for retail merchandise. We provide promotion and advertising for content providers of their prepaid 

content throughout our retail distribution network. We also provide card production and processing services to some of our prepaid gift card partners and telecom content providers.

8

Retailer and Distributor Contracts

We provide our prepaid services through POS terminals or web-based POS devices installed in retail outlets or, in the case of major retailers, through direct connections between their ECR systems and our processing centers. In markets where we operate proprietary technology, we generally own and maintain the POS terminals. In certain countries in Europe, the terminals are sold to the retailers or to distributors who service the retailer. Our agreements with major retailers for POS services typically have 
one
 to 
three
-year terms. These agreements include terms
 regarding the connection of our networks to the respective retailer's registers or payment terminals or the maintenance of POS terminals, and obligations concerning settlement and liability for transactions processed.
 Generally, our agreements with individual or small retailers have shorter terms and provide that either party can terminate the agreement upon 
three
 to 
six
 months' notice.

The number of transactions processed on our POS networks
 have increased over the last 
five
 years at a CAGR of approximately 
16.2%
 as indicated in the following table:

epay Segment Strategy

epay's strategy is to grow revenue and defend margins in developing markets by providing value-added services to mobile operators and to decrease our reliance on mobile top-up by increasing distribution of other electronic content, expanding epay branded content, introducing new solutions to new and existing customers, and focusing on geographic expansion. 
Strategic execution behind expansion of digital media electronic content includes the development of relationships with global consumer product brands. This strategy leverages the global scale of the epay business allowing global brands to be sold in many or all the countries in which we have a presence. Examples of global brands we distribute include iTunes, Google Play, Sony, and Microsoft.

Telecommunications companies and other content providers have a substantial opportunity to increase revenues by diversifying the products and services currently offered to their retailers. epay is deploying additional content through its POS network to retailers and distributors all over the world. The reach, capabilities, and quality of the epay network are appealing as a global distribution channel. We are 
one
 of the largest worldwide multi-country operators, and believe we have a distinct competitive advantage with the existing relationships that we maintain with prepaid content providers and retailers.

Seasonality

As the product mix continues to change, the epay business is impacted by seasonality during the fourth quarter and first quarter of each year due to the higher transaction levels during the holiday season and lower levels following the holiday season.

9

Significant Customers and Government Contracts

No individual customer of our epay Segment makes up greater than 
10
% of total consolidated revenues.
 epay maintains contract relationships with a number of companies, banks, post offices and telecommunications providers whose ownership includes the government. 

Competition

We face competition in the prepaid business in all of our markets. We compete with a few multinational companies that operate in several of our markets. In other markets, our competition is from smaller, local companies. The mobile operators in all of our markets have retail distribution networks, and in some markets, on-line distribution of their own through which they offer top-up services for their own products.

We believe our size and market share are competitive advantages in many markets. In addition, we believe our processing platforms are a competitive advantage. 
We have 
extremely flexible technical platforms that enable us to tailor POS solutions to individual retailers and mobile operator and digital media content provider requirements where appropriate. Our platforms are also able to provide value added services other than processing, which makes us a more valuable partner to the content providers and retailers. 
We have introduced new digital products into the marketplace such as digital payment for online media subscriptions. 
Many of these products are not offered by our competitors and in many countries, these are new products. 
We are capitalizing on being the first to market for these products.

The principal competitive factors in the epay Segment include price (that is, the level of commission paid to retailers for each transaction), breadth of products and up-time offered on the system. Major retailers with high volumes can demand a larger share of the commission, which increases the amount of competition among service 
providers. We are seeing signs that some mobile operators are expanding their distribution networks to provide top-up services on-line or via mobile devices, which provides other alternatives for consumers to use.

Money Transfer Segment

Overview

We provide global money transfer services primarily under the brand names Ria, Xe
 and Dandelion.

 Ria provides consumer-to-consumer money transfer services through a global network of more than 
608,000
 locations and via our website riamoneytransfer.com. 
We send money transfers from approximately 
142
 countries,
 with money transfer delivery completed in 
196
 countries
.
 The initiation of a consumer money transfer occurs through retail agents, Company-owned stores or online, while the delivery of money transfers can occur with bank correspondents, retailer agents or from certain ATMs. Our websites, and mobile wallet apps, allow consumers to send funds online, using a bank account or credit or debit card, for pay-out directly to a bank account or for cash pickup.

In addition, we provide global account-to-account money transfer services under the brand name Xe. We offer money transfer services via our website (www.xe.com) and Xe app and through customer service representatives. Xe also provides foreign currency exchange information on its currency data websites (www.xe.com and www.x-rates.com). Through Xe, we offer cash management solutions and foreign currency risk management services to small-and-medium-sized businesses.

Lastly, under the brand "Dandelion", Ria offers payment processing services to third-party partners. 
Dandelion is a leading real-time, global cross-border payment platform; it offers consumer and business transaction processing and fulfillment with alternative payout channels like bank accounts, cash pick-up and mobile wallets. Dandelion powers cross-border payments for Xe, Ria, as well as third party banks, fintechs, and big tech platforms.

Our sending agent network includes a variety of agents, including Walmart, large/medium size regional retailers, convenience stores, bodegas, multi-service shops and phone centers, which are predominantly found in areas with a 
large immigrant population. Each Ria money transfer transaction is processed using Euronet's proprietary software system and checked for security, completeness and compliance with federal and state regulations at every step of the process. Senders can track the 
progress of their transfers through Ria's customer service representatives, and funds are delivered quickly to their beneficiaries via our extensive payout network, which includes large banks and non-bank financial institutions, post offices and large retailers. 

We are 
one
 of the largest global money transfer companies measured by revenues and transaction volumes. Our Money Transfer Segment processed approximately 
$
71.3
 billion 

in money transfers in

2024
.

Sources of Revenues

Revenues in the Money Transfer Segment are primarily derived through the charging of a transaction fee, as well as a margin earned from purchasing foreign currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the foreign currency to customers
 at retail exchange
 rates. Sending agents and receiving agents for consumer-to-consumer products each earn fees for cash collection and distribution services. Euronet recognizes these fees as direct operating costs at the time of sale.

Money Transfer Products and Services

Money transfer products and services are sold primarily through the following channels: at agent locations, Company-owned stores, mobile apps, TeleRia phone, and on internet enabled devices at riamoneytransfer.com and xe.com. 
In an online transaction, customers send funds, using a bank account or credit or debit card, for pay-out at most of our agent locations around the world or directly to a bank account.

In addition to money transfers, Ria also offers customers bill payment services, payment alternatives such as money orders, comprehensive check cashing services for a wide variety of issued checks, along with competitive foreign currency exchange services and mobile top-up. 
Our bill payment services offer timely posting of customer bills for over 7,900
 companies, including electric and gas utilities and telephone/wireless companies.
 These services are all offered through our Company-owned stores while select services are offered through our agents in certain markets.

Under the brand "Dandelion", Ria offers payment processing services to third party partners. 
The Dandelion cross-border payments platform provides financial institutions,

fintechs

such as digital wallets and b
anks, and enterprise software companies access to

Euronet's

money transfer network through an API connection. 
This enables these companies to build financial solutions with real-time payment capabilities to the more than 
608,000
 cash locations, and 
4.1
 billion bank accounts and 
3.1
 billion digital wallet accounts
 the

Euronet

money transfer network reaches.

Xe offers an account-to-account international payment service to high-income individuals and small-and-medium sized businesses, complementing our existing consumer-to-consumer money transfer business. Xe has a multi-channel platform which allows customers to make transfers, track payments and manage their international payment activity online or through a customer service representative. Xe offers cash management solutions and foreign currency risk management services to small-and-medium sized businesses. Xe also offers foreign currency exchange subscriptions and advertising on its websites.

Money Transfer Segment Strategy

The Money Transfer Segment's strategy is to increase the volume of money transfers processed by leveraging our existing banking and merchant/retailer relationships to expand 
direct to consumer digital products, and Dandelion’s wholesale
products through its 
agent and correspondent networks in existing corridors. In addition, we pursue expansion into high-potential money transfer corridors from the U.S. and internationally beyond the traditional U.S. to Mexico corridor. Further, we expect to continue to take advantage of 
cross-selling opportunities with our epay and EFT Processing Segments by providing prepaid services through our stores and agents and offering our money transfer services at select prepaid retail locations and ATMs we operate in key markets. We will continue to make investments in our systems to support this growth. Additionally, we are expanding our Xe business into new markets.

Seasonality

Our money transfer business is significantly impacted by seasonality that varies by region. In most of our markets, we experience increased money transfer transaction levels during the month of May and in the fourth quarter of each year, coinciding with various holidays. Additionally, in the U.S. to Mexico corridor, we usually experience our heaviest volume during the May through October time frame, coinciding with the increase in worker migration patterns and various holidays, and our lowest volumes during the first quarter.

Significant Customers and Government Contracts

No individual customer of our Money Transfer Segment makes up greater than 
10
% of total consolidated revenues. The Money Transfer Segment maintains correspondent relationships with a number of financial institutions whose ownership includes governments of the correspondents' countries of origin.

Competition

Our primary competitors in the money transfer and bill payment business include other large money transfer companies and electronic money transmitters, together with hundreds of smaller registered and unregistered money transmitters, as well as certain major national and regional banks, financial institutions, and independent sales organizations. Our competition includes The Western Union Company, the leading competitor with revenue 
approximately 
two
 times greater than our revenue. 
The Western Union Company has a significant competitive 
advantage due to its greater resources and access to capital for expansion. This may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers, agents, or correspondents, which may result in a loss of our current or potential customers or could force us to lower our prices. In addition to traditional money payment services, new technologies are emerging that compete with traditional money payment services, such as stored-value cards, debit networks, web-based services, mobile apps, and digital currencies. Our continued growth also depends upon our ability to compete effectively with these alternative technologies.

Employees

We had approximately 
10,600
, 

10,000
 and

9,500
 employees as of

 December 31, 2024
,

2023
, and

2022
, respectively. We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to recruit, retain and motivate qualified management, technical and administrative employees. Currently, no union represents any of our employees, except in 
one
 of our Spanish subsidiaries. We experienced no work stoppages or strikes by our workforce in

2024

and we consider relations with our employees to be good.

12

Government Regulation

As discussed below, many of our business activities are subject to regulation in our current markets. In the Money Transfer Segment, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations of the U.S., individual U.S. states and foreign governments. These include international, federal, and state anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations, money transfer and payment instrument licensing laws, escheat laws, laws covering consumer privacy, data protection and information security and consumer disclosure and consumer protection laws. Our operations have also been subject to increasingly strict requirements intended to help prevent and detect a variety of illegal financial activity, including money laundering, terrorist financing, unauthorized access to personal customer data and other illegal activities. The more significant of these laws and regulations are discussed below. Noncompliance with these laws and requirements could result in the loss or suspension of licenses or registrations required to provide money transfer services through retail agents, Company owned stores, mobile apps or online. For more discussion, see Item 
1
A - Risk Factors.   

Any further expansion of our activity into areas that are qualified as "financial activity" under local legislation may subject us to licensing and we may be required to comply with various conditions to obtain such licenses. Moreover, the interpretations of bank regulatory authorities as to the activity we currently conduct might change in the future. We monitor our business for compliance with applicable laws or regulations regarding financial activities.

Certain of our European product offerings, including in particular, our money transfer services, merchant acquiring and bill payment products, are regulated payment services requiring a license under 
the Second Payment Services Directive, or PSD
2
.

PSD
2
 requires a license to perform certain defined "payment services" in a European Economic Area (“EEA”) Member State and such license may be extended throughout other Member States of the EEA through passporting of the license (either on a freedom of service or freedom of establishment basis). Conditions for obtaining the license include minimum capital requirements, establishment of procedures for safeguarding of funds, and certain governance and reporting requirements. In addition, certain obligations relating to internal controls and the conduct of business, in particular, consumer disclosure requirements and certain rules regarding the timing and settlement of payments, must be met. We have payment institution licenses in the U.K., France, Germany, Greece and Spain and are complying with these requirements. We passported our U.K., German, and Spanish payment services authorizations to several EEA Member States. As a result of Brexit, our U.K, payment institution is no longer capable of passporting its license into the EEA and the relevant EEA business was transferred to our other licenses prior to the end of the Brexit transition period. Additionally, in the U.K., we have obtained an e-money license. The e-money license allows Euronet to issue e-money and provide the same payment services as a PSD
2
 licensee.

The e-money license imposes certain requirements similar to those of the payment services license, including minimum capital requirements, consumer disclosure and internal controls. 

Money Transfer and Payment Instrument Licensing

Licensing requirements in the U.S. are generally driven by the various state banking departments regulating the businesses of money transfers and issuances of payment instruments. Typical requirements include the meeting of minimum net worth requirements, maintaining permissible investments (e.g., cash, agent receivables, and government-backed securities) at levels commensurate with outstanding payment obligations and the filing of a security instrument (typically in the form of a surety bond) to offset the risk of default of trustee obligations by the license holder. We are required by many state regulators to submit ongoing reports of licensed activity, most often 
on a quarterly or monthly basis, that address changes to agent and branch locations, operating and financial performance, permissible investments, and outstanding transmission liabilities. These periodic reports are utilized by the regulator to monitor ongoing compliance with state licensing laws. A number of major state regulators also conduct periodic examinations of license holders and their authorized delegates, generally with a frequency of every 
one
 to 
two
 years. Examinations are most often comprehensive in nature, addressing both the safety and soundness and overall compliance by the license holder with regard to state and federal regulations. Such examinations are typically performed on-site at the license holder's headquarters or operations center; however, certain states may choose to perform examinations off-site as well.

13

Money transmitters, issuers of payment instruments and their agents are required to comply with U.S. federal, state and/or foreign anti-money laundering laws and regulations. In summary, our Money Transfer Segment, as well as our agent network, is subject to regulations issued by the different state and foreign national regulators who license us, the Office of Foreign Assets 

Control ("OFAC"), the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act ("BSA"), the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FINCEN"), as well as any existing or future regulations that impact any aspect of our money transfer business.

A similar s
et of regulations applies to our money transfer businesses in most of the foreign countries in which we originate transactions. These laws and regulations include monetary limits for money transfers into or out of a country, rules regarding the foreign currency exchange rates offered, as well as other limitations or rules for which we must maintain compliance.

Regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad may impose additional rules on the conduct of our Money Transfer Segment that could have a significant impact on our operations and our agent network. In this regard, the U.S. federal government has implemented U.S. federal regulations for electronic money transfers, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which provides consumer protections for international remittance transfers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), adopted a rule that provides additional protections for consumers who transmit money internationally, including disclosure requirements, cancellation rights and error resolution procedures for consumer complaints. Under U.S. federal law, it is unlawful for any provider of consumer financial products or services to engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (collectively, "UDAAPs"). The CFPB has rule making and enforcement authority to prevent UDAAPs in connection with transactions for consumer financial products or services. The CFPB audits our compliance with these rules, and we may be subject to fines or penalties for violations of any of such rules.

Escheat Regulati
ons

Our Money Transfer Segment is subject to the unclaimed or abandoned property (i.e., "escheat") regulations of the United States and certain foreign countries in which we operate. These laws require us to turn over property held by Euronet on behalf of others remaining unclaimed after specified periods of time (i.e., "dormancy" or "escheat" periods). Such abandoned property is generally attributable to the failure of beneficiary parties to claim money transfers or the failure to negotiate money orders, a form of payment instrument. We have policies and programs in place to help us monitor the required information relating to each money transfer or payment instrument for possible eventual reporting to the jurisdiction from which the order was 
originally received. In the U.S., reporting of unclaimed property by money service companies is performed annually, generally with a due date of on or before November 1. State banking department regulators will typically include a review of Euronet escheat procedures and related filings as part of their examination protocol.

Privacy and Information Security Regulations

Our operations involve the collection and storage of certain types of personal customer 
data that are subject to pr
ivacy and security laws in the U.S. and abroad. In the United States, we are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLBA") and various state laws including California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which require that financial institutions have in place policies regarding the collection, processing, storage, and disclosure of information considered nonpublic personal information. Laws in other countries include the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation (
2016
/
679
) ("GDPR"), 
as well as the laws of other countries. 
The GDPR establishes stringent requirements for the collection and processing of personal information of individuals within the E.U. The GDPR establishes certain rights of individuals regarding personal information processed by companies as well as requirements for information security and imposes significant fines that may be revenue-based for violation of its requirements. Any failure on our part to meet the requirements of the GDPR could result 
in the imposition of fines and penalties that could affect our financial results.

We comply with the GLBA and applicable state privacy provisions. In July 2020, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield as a lawful mechanism for transferring personal data to the US as a result of concerns related to surveillance by law enforcement agencies and a lack of judicial redress by individuals in the EU (known as the "Schrems II" decision). Despite the July 2020 ruling of the European Court of Justice, we believe we remain in compliance with E.U. regulations regarding the transfer of personal
 data to the United States and other jurisdictions.

Recently, as identity theft has been on the rise, there has been increased public attention to concerns about information security and consumer privacy, accompanied by laws and regulations addressing the issue. We believe we are compliant with these laws and regulations; however, this is a rapidly evolving area and there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the existing and new regulations, which could have a material, adverse impact on our Money Transfer Segment business.

14

Anti-corruption and Bribery

We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), which prohibits U.S. and other business entities from making improper payments to foreign government officials, political parties, or political party officials. We are also subject to the

 applicable anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, thus potentially exposing us to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions.

The anti-corruption provisions of the FCPA are enforced by the United States Department of Justice.

In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") requires strict compliance with certain accounting and internal control standards set forth under the FCPA.

Because our services are offered in many countries throughout the world and we do business with a number of banks and other financial institutions owned or controlled by foreign governments, we face a higher risk associated with FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws than many other companies and we have policies and procedures in place to address compliance with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws. Any determination that we have violated these laws could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations. Failure to comply with our policies and procedures or the FCPA and other laws can expose Euronet and/or individual employees to potentially severe criminal and civil penalties.

Such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Sanctions Compliance

In addition to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, our products and services are subject to economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations promulgated by OFAC and other jurisdictions in which our products and services are offered.

The sanctions laws and regulations prohibit or restrict transactions to or from (or dealings with or involving) certain countries, regions, governments, and in certain circumstances, specified foreign nationals, as well as with certain individuals and entities such as narcotics traffickers, terrorists, and terrorist organizations. These sanctions laws and regulations require screening of transactions against government watch-lists, including but not limited to, the watch-lists maintained by OFAC, and include transactional and other reporting to government agencies.

Compliance Policies and Programs

We have developed risk-based policies and programs to comply with existing and new laws, regulations and other 
requirements outlined above, including having dedicated compliance personnel, training programs, automated monitoring systems and support functions for our offices and agents. To assist in managing and monitoring our money laundering and terrorist financing risks, we continue to have our compliance programs, in many countries, independently examined on an annual basis. In addition, we continue to enhance our anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing compliance policy, procedures and monitoring systems, as well as our consumer protection policies and procedures.

Intellectual Property

Each of our 
three
 operating segments utilizes intellectual property which is protected in varying degrees by a combination of trademark, patent, and copyright laws, as well as trade secret protection, license, and confidentiality agreements.

The brand names of "Ria," "Ria Financial Services," "Ria Envia," "Xe," "Dandelion," derivations of those brand names and certain other brand names, and related logo's, are material to our Money Transfer Segment and are registered trademarks and/or service marks in most of the markets in which our Money Transfer Segment operates. Consumer perception of these brand names and logos is i
mportant to the growth prospects of our money transfer business. We also hold a U.S. patent on a card-based money transfer and bill payment system that allows transactions to be initiated primarily through POS terminals and integrated cash register systems.

With respect to our EFT Processing Segment, we have registered or applied for registration of our trademarks, including the names "Euronet" and/or our related logo, as well as other trade names in most markets in which these tra
demarks are used. Certain trademark authorities have notified us that they consider these trademarks to be generic and, therefore, not protected by trademark laws. This determination does not affect our ability to use the Euronet trademark in those markets, but it would prevent us from stopping other parties from using it in competition with Euronet. We have registered the "Euronet" trademark in the class of ATM machines in Germany, the U.K., and certain other Western European countries. We have filed pe
nding applications and/or obtained patents for a number of our new software products and our processing technology, including certain top-up services and DCC services.

15

With respect to our epay Segment, we maintain registered trademarks for the "epay" brand and logo in the U.S., U.K., E.U. (through a Community Trademark application, which provides enforceability of the epay trademark in all member states of the EU), Brazil, Singapore, India, Australia, and New Zealand. We have filed trademark applications for additional iterations of the "epay” brand in India, which are pending.

Additionally, we have filed a trademark application for 
the “epay” brand with the Madrid Protocol, which, if granted, will simplify the process to extending the international protection of the epay trademark. We cannot be certain that we are entitled to use the epay trademark in any markets other than those in which we have registered the trademark; however, before entering new markets, we conduct searches to understand our usage rights. We have filed patent applications for certain POS top-up and other epay technology. Certain patents have been granted while others have been refused or are still pending. We also hold a patent license covering certain of epay's operations in the U.S.

Technology in the areas in which we operate is developing very rapidly
, and we are aware that many other companies have filed patent applications for products, processes, and services similar to those we provide. The procedures of the U.S. patent office make it difficult for us to predict whether our patent applications will be approved or will be granted priority dates that are earlier than other patents that have been filed for similar products or services. Moreover, many "process patents" have been filed in the U.S. over recent years covering processes that are in wide
 use in the money transfer, EFT, and prepaid processing industries. If any of these patents are considered to cover technology that has been incorporated into our systems, we may be required to obtain additional licenses and pay royalties to the holders of such patents to continue to use the affected technology or be prohibited from continuing the offering of such services if licenses are not obtained. This could materially and adversely affect our business.

A. 
Risk Facto
rs

Our operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including 
those described below. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an 

investment decision. The risks and uncertainties described below are not necessarily

 organized in order of priority or probability.

If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial 

condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In 

that case, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline substantially.

This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks

 and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those

 anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of

 factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual

 Report. 

GOVERNMENT AND REGULATION

As a multinational company, we
face legal and operational risks from diverse local regulations that may impact
our operations.

Conducting business
internationally complicates compliance with varied regional laws. Our financial
transaction processing networks introduce new products that are subject to
rapidly changing regulations. Despite having skilled local personnel, we cannot
guarantee full compliance with customs, currency controls, data protection,
anti-money laundering, sanctions, employment, and transfer pricing laws. We
also cannot predict potential changes to these regulations that may negatively
affect our business.

For our epay Segment, as we
expand our electronic payment offerings, these may become subject to state,
federal, or international laws requiring licensure for us and our partners.
Increased regulation could adversely impact our epay business, particularly if
gift voucher regulations change, affecting revenue from unredeemed vouchers.

Our money transfer services are
regulated by U.S. states, the federal government, and foreign governments where
we operate. Changes in these regulations or our ability to maintain necessary
licenses may materially affect our financial results and cash flow.
Furthermore, evolving regulations may alter the competitive landscape,
potentially impacting our financial outcomes. New laws or changes from
organizations like Visa® and Mastercard® that limit our pricing or services
could substantially affect our business. Additionally, shifts in regulatory
interpretations could heighten the risk of enforcement actions, fines, and
penalties across jurisdictions.

Our operations in emerging
markets, including Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific,
Africa, and South America, expose us to significant geopolitical and economic
risks.

Political Instability:
 Political
unrest, regime change, and military conflicts can disrupt our operations,
damage our assets, and impact consumer confidence.

Economic Downturns:
 Economic
downturns, including those driven by inflation, currency fluctuations, and
global recessions, can reduce demand for our services and negatively impact our
financial performance.

Regulatory Uncertainty:
 Changes
in government policies, including those related to foreign investment, currency
controls, and taxation, can create significant uncertainty and operational
challenges.

Repatriation of Profits:

Restrictions on the repatriation of profits from foreign subsidiaries can limit
our ability to access capital and negatively impact our financial flexibility.

The ongoing geopolitical tensions, including the conflict in Ukraine, highlight the potential for unforeseen events to significantly impact our business and financial results.

We conduct business in many international markets with complex and evolving tax 

rules, including value added tax rules, which subject us to international tax 

compliance risks which could adversely affect our operating results.

While we obtain advice from legal
and tax advisors as necessary to help assure compliance
with tax and regulatory matters,
most tax jurisdictions that we operate in have complex and subjective
rules regarding the valuation of intercompany services, cross-border
payments between affiliated companies and the related effects on
income tax, value added tax (“VAT”), transfer tax and
share registration tax. Our foreign subsidiaries frequently undergo VAT
reviews, and from time to time undergo comprehensive tax reviews and
may be required to make additional tax payments should the review
result in different interpretations, allocations or valuations of our products
and services.

Additionally, as a result of economic
downturns, tax receipts have decreased and/or government spending
has increased in many of the countries in which we operate. Consequently,
governments may increase tax rates or implement new taxes in
order to compensate for gaps between tax revenues and expenditures.
Governments may prohibit or restrict the use of certain legal structures
designed to minimize taxes. Any such tax increases, whether
borne by us or our customers, could negatively impact our operating results or
the demand for our products and services.

The European Union ("EU") member states formally
adopted the EU's Pillar Two Directive, which was
established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and
which generally provides for a 15 percent minimum
effective tax rate for multinational enterprises, in every
jurisdiction in which they operate. While we do not anticipate that the
Pillar Two Directive will have a material impact on
our tax provision or effective tax rate, we continue to
monitor evolving tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which we
operate, including eligibility for any transitional safe harbor rules.

We could be adversely affected
by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar
anti-corruption laws.

Our global operations expose us
to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar laws in other jurisdictions. These
laws prohibit improper payments to government officials or employees of commercial
enterprises. 
We operate in various countries
with varying levels of corruption, and complying with these laws can sometimes
conflict with local customs. Our interactions with government officials and our
contracts with foreign entities increase the risk of violations.

Despite our compliance policies
and procedures, there is no guarantee that all our employees, consultants, and
agents will adhere to them. Violations of anti-corruption laws could result in
significant penalties, including criminal and civil fines, which could
materially harm our financial performance.

19

Impact of Immigration Patterns

Our money transfer business
heavily relies on remittances sent by workers who migrate to foreign countries
for employment. 
Changes in U.S. and foreign
government immigration policies, including those related to worker visas and
border controls, could significantly impact migration patterns. 
A decline in immigration due to
policy changes could adversely affect the volume of money transfers processed
through our platform, negatively impacting our revenues and earnings.

Market Expansion and Regulatory Risks

Our future growth depends on our
ability to expand our market share in the existing electronic money transfer
market and successfully enter new markets. 
Achieving this requires
significant investments in technology and distribution channels, which may not
be feasible given our available resources. 
Additionally, the evolving
regulatory landscape, including anti-money laundering (AML), sanctions, and
consumer protection regulations, presents significant compliance challenges. 
Non-compliance with these
regulations could result in substantial fines and penalties, potentially
impacting our financial performance and hindering our growth prospects.

Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on our business
.

Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers, and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, we make statements about our goals and initiatives through our various non-financial reports, information provided on our website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside our control. We cannot guarantee that we will achieve our environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state, or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.

We are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by us sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject us to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving us, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings, and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In recognition of these considerations, we may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase our cost of sales and operating expenses and require us to change its business practices and limit our ability to offer certain products and services. The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If

one

or more legal matters were resolved against us or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, our results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against us, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, us to change our business practices and limit our
 ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. While we maintain insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.

20

SUPPLY CHAIN AND THIRD PARTIES

Because we typically enter into short-term contracts with content providers and 

retailers, our epay business is subject to the risk of non-renewal of those 

contracts, or renewal under less favorable terms.

Our contracts with content providers to distribute and process content, including prepaid mobile airtime top-up services, typically have terms of less than 
three
 years. Our contracts with content providers are not exclusive, so these providers may enter into contracts with other service providers. In addition, our service contracts with major retailers typically have terms of 
one
 to 
three
 years. The cancellation or non-renewal of 
one
 or more of our significant content provider or retail 
contracts, or of a large enough group of our contracts with smaller retailers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The renewal of contracts under less favorable payment terms, margins or other terms could have a material adverse impact on our working capital requirements and/or results from operations. In addition, our contracts generally permit content providers to reduce our margin or commission at any time. Commission and margin revenue or fee reductions by any of the content providers could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Our 
epay
 business is focused on expanding and differentiating its suite of prepaid digital product offerings on a global basis, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into relationships on favorable terms with additional content providers or renew or expand current relationships and contracts on favorable terms. The inability to continue to grow our suite of electronic content and electronic payment product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

The stability and growth of our EFT Processing Segment may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain

our current card acceptance and ATM management agreements with banks and

international card organizations, and to secure new arrangements for card

acceptance and ATM management.

The stability and future growth of our EFT Processing Segment depends in part on our ability to sign card acceptance and ATM management agreements with banks and international card organizations. Card acceptance agreements allow our

ATMs

to accept credit and debit cards issued by banks and international card organizations. ATM management agreements generate service income from our management of

ATMs

for banks.

These agreements have expiration dates, and banks and international card organizations are generally not obligated to renew them. Our existing contracts generally have terms of

five

to

seven

years and a number of them expire or are up for renewal each year. In some cases, banks may terminate their contracts prior to the expiration of their terms. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to sign or maintain these agreements on terms and conditions acceptable to us or that international card organizations will continue to permit our

ATMs

to accept their credit and debit cards. The inability to continue to sign or maintain these agreements, or to continue to accept the credit and 
debit cards of local banks and international card organizations at our

ATMs

in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, financial condition, or results of operations.

ATM Processing Risks

Our ATM business faces several key risks related to:

Transaction Fees:

We are subject to competitive pressures on ATM transaction fees, including potential reductions in interchange fees set by card networks and declining fees charged to customers.

Our ability to maintain or increase transaction fees is limited, as they are often determined by market forces and agreements with other industry players.

Settlement Risks:

We rely on third parties, such as card networks and processing switches, for the settlement of transactions.

Changes in rules or procedures by these third parties, or their failure to fulfill their obligations, could disrupt settlement processes and negatively impact our revenue.

Dependence on Third Parties:

Our business is dependent on the continued cooperation and support of card networks, processing switches, and other third parties.

Changes in their policies, rules, or fees could significantly impact our profitability.

21

We could incur substantial losses if 
one
 of the third-party depository

 institutions or financial institutions we use in our operations were to fail.

As part of our business operations, we maintain cash balances at third party depository institutions. We could incur substantial losses if a financial institution in which we have significant deposits fails.

Our money transfer business involves transferring funds internationally and is dependent upon foreign and domestic financial institutions, including our competitors, to execute funds transfers and foreign currency transactions. Changes to existing regulations of financial institution operations, such as those designed to combat terrorism or money laundering, could require us to alter our operating procedures in a manner that increases our cost of doing business or to terminate certain product offerings. In addition, as a result of existing regulations and/or changes to those regulations, financial institutions could decide to cease providing the services on which we depend, requiring us to terminate certain product offerings.

Dependence on Third Parties
for ATM Operations

Our ATM operations rely
heavily on third parties, including:

Sponsor Banks:
 In many markets, we require sponsor bank arrangements to comply with local regulations and operate on financial transaction switching networks.

Cash Providers:
 We rely on third-party financial institutions to provide a significant portion of the cash required to operate our ATM networks.

Dependence on these third
parties presents several risks:

Loss of Operating Licenses:
 Failure to secure or maintain sponsor bank arrangements could prevent us from operating in certain markets.

Disruption of Cash Supply:
 If cash providers terminate their agreements or are unable to fulfill their obligations, it could severely disrupt our ATM operations and require us to find alternative sources of funding, potentially at higher costs.

Negotiation Challenges:
 Negotiating and maintaining favorable terms with sponsor banks and cash providers can be challenging and may involve significant costs.

These risks could adversely
impact our ability to operate our ATM networks, increase our operating costs,
and negatively impact our financial results.

If we are unable to maintain our money transfer agent and correspondent

 networks, our business may be adversely affected.

Our consumer-to-consumer money transfer-based revenues are primarily generated through the use of our agent and correspondent networks. If agents or correspondents decide to leave our network or if we are unable to sign new agents or correspondents, our revenue and profit growth rates may be adversely affected. Our agents and correspondents are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that vary significantly, depending on the legal jurisdiction. Changes in these laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to maintain the networks or the cost of providing money transfer services. In addition, agents may generate fewer transactions or less revenue due to various factors, including increased competition. Because our agents and correspondents are third parties that may sell products and provide services in addition to our money transfer services, they may encounter business difficulties unrelated to the provision of our services, which may cause the agents or correspondents to reduce their number of locations or hours of operation, or cease doing business altogether.

22

CORPORATE GROWTH STRATEGIES

Risks Related to Acquisitions

Our growth strategy may include
future acquisitions. However, acquisitions involve inherent risks, including:

Integration Challenges:
 Successfully integrating acquired businesses can be complex and challenging. Difficulties in integrating operations, technology, and personnel can disrupt business operations, negatively impact customer relationships, and hinder the achievement of anticipated synergies.

Unforeseen Liabilities and Contingencies:
 Acquired businesses may have undisclosed liabilities or contingent obligations that could adversely impact our financial results.

Difficulties in Achieving Synergies:
 Realizing the anticipated synergies from acquisitions can be difficult and may take longer than expected. Factors such as unforeseen competitive pressures, regulatory changes, and economic downturns can hinder the achievement of these synergies.

Dilution of Shareholder Value:
 Acquisitions may be financed through the issuance of equity, which could dilute existing shareholders' ownership and potentially depress the market price of our common stock.

If consumer confidence in our business or brands declines, our
business may be adversely affected.

A decline in consumer confidence
in our brands, our ability to provide reliable and secure services, or the
money transfer industry as a whole could materially and adversely impact our
business.

Specifically, a decline in
consumer confidence could:

Reduce transaction volumes:
 Customers may choose to use alternative money transfer methods, such as cash or competing services, or may reduce their overall remittance activity.

Increase customer churn:
 Existing customers may switch to competitors perceived to be more reliable or trustworthy.

Damage our reputation:
 Negative publicity or perceived service disruptions can erode customer trust and negatively impact our brand image.

Increase operating costs:
 We may need to invest in additional marketing and customer service efforts to regain customer trust and mitigate the impact of declining confidence.

A significant decline in consumer
confidence could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, profitability,
and financial condition.

23

CAPITAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

Macroeconomic and Currency Risks

Our business is subject to
various macroeconomic and currency risks, including:

Economic Cycles and Seasonality: 

Economic downturns, recessions, and changes in consumer spending patterns can negatively impact transaction volumes across our business segments.

Seasonal fluctuations in demand, such as holiday seasonality and tourism patterns, can lead to significant variations in our quarterly results.

Currency Fluctuations:

Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can adversely impact our financial results, particularly in the Money Transfer Segment where we are exposed to currency exchange risk between the currencies of sending and receiving countries.

The adoption of new currencies in the countries where we operate could also create significant operational and financial challenges.

Geopolitical and Economic Instability: 

Geopolitical events, such as wars, political instability, and natural disasters, can disrupt our operations and negatively impact customer demand.

These risks can impact our
business by:

Reducing transaction volumes.

Increasing operating costs.

Impairing the value of our assets.

Creating volatility in our financial results.

We utilize various strategies
to mitigate these risks, such as:

Diversification of our geographic footprint.

Hedging strategies to mitigate currency exchange risk.

Continuous monitoring of economic and political developments.

However, we cannot fully
eliminate the impact of these macroeconomic and currency risks on our business.

24

We have a substantial amount of debt and other contractual commitments, and while the 

cost of servicing those obligations is not expected to adversely affect our business, the risk could increase if we incur more debt. We may be required to prepay

 our obligations under the credit facility. 

As of 
December 31, 2024
, total liabilities were $
4,605
 million, of which $
1,379
 million represents long-term liabilities, and total assets were $
5,835
 million. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all such obligations as a result of a variety of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. If the opportunity of a strategic acquisition arises or if we enter into new contracts that require the installation or servicing of infrastructure, such as 
processing centers, ATM machines or POS terminals on a faster pace than anticipated, we may be required to incur additional debt for these purposes and to fund our working capital needs, including ATM network cash, which we may not be able to obtain. 
The level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to investors, including the following:

•

our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes may be limited, or financing may be unavailable;

•

a portion of our cash flows must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and other obligations and will not be available for use in our business;

•

our level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;

•

our level of indebtedness will make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and/or a downturn in our business, thereby making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; and

•

because a portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate of interest, our actual debt service obligations could increase as a result of adverse changes in interest rates.

If we fail to make required debt payments, or if we fail to comply with other covenants in our debt service agreements, we would be in default under the terms of these agreements. This default would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate repayment of this debt and could cause defaults under other indebtedness that we have.

Restrictive covenants in our credit facilities may adversely affect us. Our Credit Facility (as defined below) contains

two

financial covenants that we must meet as defined in the agreement: (
1
) Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, and (
2
) Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. To remain in compliance with our debt covenants, we may be required to increase Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), repay debt, or both. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets, liquidity or EBITDA to meet or avoid these obligations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.

Our ability to secure additional financing for growth or to refinance any of our existing debt is also dependent upon the availability of credit in the marketplace, which has experienced severe disruptions in the past. If we are unable to secure additional financing or such financing is not available at acceptable terms, we may be unable to secure financing for growth or refinance our debt obligations, if necessary.

25

CYBER, PHYSICAL ASSET, AND DATA SECURITY

Our business relies heavily on sophisticated computer systems
and networks. These systems are vulnerable to various operational and
cybersecurity risks, including:

System Outages:
 Disruptions to our computer systems and telecommunications networks due to hardware or software failures, power outages, natural disasters, or security breaches can significantly impact our operations, leading to service interruptions, revenue losses, and damage to our reputation.

Cybersecurity Threats:
 We face the risk of cyberattacks, including data breaches, malware infections, ransomware attacks, and denial-of-service attacks. These threats can result in unauthorized access to sensitive customer data, financial losses, reputational harm, regulatory fines, and legal liabilities.

Data Privacy and Security:
 We are subject to stringent data privacy and security regulations. Breaches of customer data can result in significant fines, litigation, and damage to our brand.

Our mitigation efforts include:

Implementing robust security measures, such as encryption, access controls, and intrusion detection systems.

Maintaining business continuity and disaster recovery plans.

Regularly updating and enhancing our security protocols.

However, despite these efforts,
we cannot guarantee complete protection against all cyber threats and
operational disruptions.

Failures of third-party service providers we rely upon could lead to financial loss. 

We rely on third party service providers to support key portions of our operations. We also rely on third party service providers to provide part or all of certain services we deliver to customers. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. The failure of these services by a third-party could have a material impact upon our delivery of services to customers. Such a failure could lead to damage claims, loss of customers, and reputational harm, depending on the duration and severity of the failure. Third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf. These third-party vendors are subject to similar risks as us relating to cybersecurity, breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees. 
One
 or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and, if any such event does occur, it may not be adequately addressed, either operationally or financially, by the third-party vendor. Certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations. If a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, our customers could be negatively impacted, and it could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding
 data protection.

We are subject to an increasing number of federal, state, and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among us and our international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes us to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require us to change its our business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. We make statements about its our use and disclosure of personal information through its our privacy policy, information provided on its our website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by us to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, we are also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and we are subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding our compliance with these obligations. If we fail to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under our agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, we can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines. Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, we can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards. We could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

26

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

Our competition in the EFT Processing Segment, epay Segment and Money Transfer

 Segment includes large, well-financed companies and financial institutions 

larger than us with earlier entry into the market. As a result, we may lack the

 financial resources and access to capital needed to capture increased market 

share.

EFT Processing Segment

- Our principal EFT Processing competitors include ATM networks owned by banks and national switches consisting of consortiums of local banks that provide outsourcing and transaction services only to banks and independent ATM deployers in that country. Large, well-financed companies offer ATM network and outsourcing services that compete with us in various markets. In some cases, these companies also sell a broader 
range of card and processing services than we do, and are, in some cases, willing to discount ATM services to obtain large contracts covering a broad range of services. Competitive factors in our EFT Processing Segment include network availability and response time, breadth of service offering, price to both the bank and to its customers, ATM location and access to other networks.

epay Segment

- We face competition in the epay business in all of our markets. A few multinational companies operate in several of our markets, and we therefore compete with them in a number of countries. In other markets, our competition is from smaller, local companies. Major retailers with high volumes are in a position to demand a larger share of margin/commissions or to negotiate directly with the content providers, which may compress our margins. Additionally, certain of our content providers, including mobile phone operators have entered into direct contracts with retailers and/or have developed processing technology that diminishes or eliminates the need for intermediate processors and distributors.

Money Transfer Segment
 -
 Our primary competitors in the money transfer and bill payment business include other large money transfer companies and electronic money transmitters, as well as certain major national and regional banks, financial institutions, and independent sales organizations. Our competitors include The Western Union Company and MoneyGram International Inc. The Western Union Company has a significant competitive advantage due to its greater resources and access to capital for expansion. This may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers, which may result in a loss of our current or potential customers or could force us to lower our prices. Either of these actions could have an adverse impact on our revenues. In addition, our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to the development of new technologies that provide improved functionality and features to their product and service offerings. If successful, their development efforts could render our product and service offerings less desirable, resulting in the loss of customers or a reduction in the price we could demand for our services. In addition to traditional money payment services, new technologies are emerging that may effectively compete with traditional money payment services, such as stored-value cards, 
debit networks, web-based services, and digital currencies. Our continued growth depends upon our ability to compete effectively with these alternative technologies.

Developments in payments could materially reduce our

transaction levels and revenues.

Certain developments in the field of payments may reduce the need for

ATMs, prepaid product POS terminals and money transfer agents. An example of this type of development is the use of near field technology in retail transactions, which if widely accepted in a market reduces the need for cash and can negatively impact the level of ATM transactions in that market. Advances in biometric payment solutions could have similar adverse impacts. These developments may reduce the transaction levels that we experience on our networks in the markets where they occur. Financial institutions, retailers and agents could elect to increase fees to their customers for using our services, which may cause a decline in the use of our services and have an adverse effect on our revenues. If transaction levels over our existing network of

ATMs, POS terminals, agents and other distribution methods do not 
increase, growth in our revenues will depend primarily on increased capital investment for new sites and developing new markets, which reduces the margin we realize from our revenues.

The mobile phone industry is a rapidly evolving area, in which technological developments, in particular the development of new billing models and distribution methods or services, may affect the demand for other services in a dramatic way. The development of any new models or technology that reduce the need or demand for prepaid mobile airtime could materially and adversely affect our business.

27

Competition in our EFT Processing Segment has increased over the last several

 years, increasing the risk that certain of our long-term bank outsourcing 

contracts may be terminated or not renewed upon expiration.

The developing markets in which we have done business have matured over the years, resulting in increasing competition. In addition, as consolidation of financial institutions in Central and Eastern Europe continues, certain of our customers have established or are establishing internal ATM management and processing capabilities. As a result of these developments, negotiations regarding renewal of contracts have become increasingly challenging and in certain cases we have reduced fees to extend contracts beyond their original terms. In certain other cases, contracts have been, and in the future may be, terminated by financial institutions resulting in a substantial reduction in revenue. Contract termination payments, if any, may be inadequate to replace revenues and operating income associated with these contracts.

Pricing and Competitive Pressures

Setting competitive and
profitable remittance prices across various corridors presents significant
challenges. 

Factors such as:

Intense Competition:
 The global remittance market is highly competitive with numerous players, including traditional money transfer operators, banks, and fintech companies.

Varying Market Dynamics:
 Each remittance corridor (e.g., Mexico to the U.S., Philippines to the U.S.) has unique characteristics, including varying levels of competition, customer demand, regulatory environments, and operating costs.

Currency Fluctuations:
 Exchange rate volatility can significantly impact profitability, requiring constant adjustments to pricing models.

Regulatory Changes:
 Changes in regulations in sending or receiving countries, including fees, taxes, and anti-money laundering requirements, can impact pricing and profitability.

Customer Sensitivity to Price:
 Remittance customers are highly price-sensitive. Setting prices too high can deter customers and lead to market share loss, while setting prices too low can negatively impact profitability.

Failure to accurately assess
and respond to these factors could result in:

Reduced revenue and profitability.

Loss of market share to competitors.

Difficulty in achieving and maintaining sustainable growth.

The Company continuously monitors
market trends, analyzes competitive pricing, and adjusts its pricing strategies
to maintain competitiveness while ensuring profitability.

GOVERNANCE MATTERS

We have various mechanisms in place to discourage takeover attempts, which may

 reduce or eliminate our stockholders' ability to sell their shares for a 

premium in a change of control transaction.

Various provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware corporate law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or takeover attempt of our company by a third party which our management and board of directors opposes. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have 
the opportunity to do so. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change of control or change in our management and board of directors. These provisions include:

preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or to discourage a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock;

classification of our directors into 
three
 classes with respect to the time for which they hold office;

supermajority voting requirements to amend the provision in our certificate of incorporation providing for the classification of our directors into 
three
 such classes;

non-cumulative voting for directors;

control by our board of directors of the size of our board of directors;

limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;

advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our stockholders at stockholder meetings; and

an exclusive forum bylaw provision for all internal corporate claims.

28

Additionally, we are authorized to issue up to a total of 
90
 million shares of common stock, potentially diluting equity ownership of current holders and the share price of our common stock.

We believe
 that it is necessary to 
maintain a sufficient number of available authorized shares of our common stock in order to provide us with the flexibility to issue common stock for business purposes that may arise as deemed advisable by our Board. These purposes could include, among other things, (i) to declare future stock dividends or stock splits, which may increase the liquidity of our shares; (ii) the sale of stock to obtain additional capital or to acquire other companies or businesses, which could enhance our growth strategy or allow us to reduce debt if needed; (iii) use in additional stock incentive programs and (iv) other bona fide purposes. Our Board of Directors may issue the available authorized shares of common stock without notice to, or further action by, our stockholders, unless stockholder approval is required by law or the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The issuance of additional shares of common stock may significantly dilute the equity ownership of the current holders of our common stock. Further, over the course of time, all of the issued shares have the potential to be publicly traded, perhaps in large blocks. This may result in dilution of the market price of the common stock.

An additional 
11.6
 million
 shares
 of common stock, representing approximately 
27
% of the
 shares outstanding as of 
December 31, 2024
, could be added to our total common 
stock outstanding through the exercise of options or the issuance of additional
 shares of our common stock pursuant to existing convertible debt and other agreements. Once issued, these shares of common stock could be traded into the 
market and result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock.

As of December 31, 2024, we had 
5.2
 million
 options and 
0.8
 million
 restricted stock awards outstanding, held by our directors, officers and employees, which entitle these holders to acquire an equal number of shares of our common stock. Of this amount, 
3.7
 million
 options are vested and exercisable as of December 31, 2024. Approximately 
2.8

million
 additional shares of our common stock may be issued in connection with our stock incentive and employee stock purchase plans. 
Accordingly, based on current trading prices of our common stock, approximately 3.1

million
 shares could potentially be added to our total current common stock outstanding through the exercise of options and the vesting of restricted stock awards, which could adversely impact the trading price for our stock. 

Of the 
6.0
 million
 total options and restricted stock awards outstanding, an aggregate of

3.7
 million
 options and 
restricted stock awards are held by persons who may be deemed to be our affiliates and who would be subject to Rule 
144
. Thus
, upon exercise of their options or sale of shares for which restrictions have lapsed, these affiliates' shares would be subject to the trading restrictions imposed by Rule 
144
. The remainder of the common shares i
ssuable under option and restricted stock award arrangements would be freely tradable in the public market. Over the course of time, all of the issued shares have the potential to be publicly traded, perhaps in large blocks. 

Upon the occurrence of certain events, another 
2.8
 million shares of common stock could be issued upon conversion of the Company's convertible notes issued in March 2019; in certain situations, the number of shares 
issuable could be higher. While we have stated that we intend to settle any conversion of these notes by issuing cash for the principal value of the 
notes and paying cash or issuing shares of common stock for the conversion value in excess of the principal, which would significantly 
reduce the number of shares issued upon conversion, if our financial condition significantly and adversely changes, we may not be able to settle as intended should the notes be converted.

KEY PERSONNEL

Retaining the founder and key executives of our Company, and of companies that

 we acquire, and finding and retaining qualified personnel is important to our

 continued success, and any inability to attract and retain such personnel could harm our operations.

The development and implementation of our strategy has depended in large part on our co-founder, 
Michael J. Brown. The retention of Mr. Brown is important to our continued success. In addition, the success of the expansion of businesses that we acquire may depend in large part upon the retention of the founders or leaders of those businesses. Our success also depends in part on our ability to hire and retain highly skilled and qualified management, operating, marketing, financial and technical personnel. The competition for qualified personnel in the markets where we conduct our business is intense and, accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to hire or retain the required personnel.

Our officers a
nd some of our key personnel have entered into service or employment agreements containing non-competition, non-disclosure, and non-solicitation covenants, which grant incentive stock options and/or restricted stock wi
th long-term vesting requirements. However, most of these contracts do not guarantee that these individuals will continue their employment with us. The loss of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, financial condition, or results of operations.

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy

We recognize that cyber threats are constantly evolving, and we must stay ahead of risks and threats to our business systems, data, infrastructure, and employees.

We take a holistic approach to cybersecurity to proactively mitigate and respond to cyber threats.

Building a robust security program and security controls are critical components that are in the core foundation of our products, culture, and management oversight.

As a financial transaction processor, we ensure security is embedded and regarded with importance across the organization and within our products and services. We recognize the criticality of maintaining the safety, security, and integrity of our systems and data to protect our customers, employees, partners, and shareholders. The security program and cybersecurity strategies are strongly supported by both executive management and our Board of Directors. Our executive management fosters a strong culture of security awareness and responsibilities from the tone at the top and across all functional teams at all levels.

The security team leadership also conducts segment level Board and/or periodic meetings with segment business leadership to share security key performance indicators ("KPIs") and risk considerations, as well as align with business strategies and gain approval for financial support for cybersecurity resources and tools.

Security leadership is also involved in financial forecasting for security needs and costs, and the Chief Technology Officer ("CTO") and Chief Financial Officer or executive management team is involved in understanding and approving security related investments and strategies.
 We 
invest in our cybersecurity personnel and protections to address critical risks to our infrastructure and systems, and we remain dedicated to continuous improvement in our cybersecurity program.

The Company’s CTO reports to our Chief Executive Officer and has been with Euronet 
17
 years and is responsible for developing and implementing our information security program and reporting on cybersecurity matters to the Board of Directors (the “Board”). 
Many on our Information Technology ("IT") security team leadership have over a decade of cybersecurity and IT control experience, certifications, and external and internal IT audit experience.

The Chief Information Security Officer ("CISO") reports to executive management independent of IT and is responsible for management of cybersecurity risk, security governance and compliance, security policies, security training, and the overall protection and defense of our networks, systems, and company data. The CISO manages the global security governance, risk, and compliance teams and is responsible for ensuring we meet our regulatory and compliance requirements as related to PCI DSS, ISO 
27001
, and other certifications we hold globally that support our business products and services.

The Global Director of Cybersecurity reports to the CTO and manages our security toolbelt and implementations, incident response, alert management, and various technical security teams.

The CISO and Global Director of Cybersecurity manage teams of cybersecurity professionals with broad experience and expertise, including PCI and other regulatory compliance, threat assessments and detection, forensic investigations, mitigation technologies, cybersecurity training, incident response, insider threats, third party risk, penetration testing, and security engineering expertise. Many members of the security leadership team across the organization have been with Euronet for more than 
10
 years. The global and segment security leadership teams work closely with legal, privacy, audit, and compliance teams to ensure we meet regulatory requirements and work together to address cyber risks in all functional areas of the organization. We also conduct strategic in person and virtual annual, quarterly, and monthly security meetings with key members of security and IT leadership to align on security priorities, initiatives, and requirements.

Our
 Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our enterprise risk management activities in general, and each of our Board committees assists the Board in the role of risk oversight. The full Board receives an update on our
 risk management process and the risk trends related to cybersecurity at least annually. The CTO attends all quarterly Board meetings and presents to the Board at a minimum of twice per year on security and cybersecurity KPIs and threat mitigations. 
The Audit Committee oversees risks including cybersecurity risks.

Our internal audit team reports on cybersecurity risks and internal and external audit results to the Audit Committee. Internal Audit performs IT security and compliance audits for SOX 
404
 purposes, as well as testing Euronet’s security standards, and performs pre-assessments for ISO 
27001
.

We also engage third party independent assessments for penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and certification such as PCI DSS, ISO 
27001
, VISA PIN and SOC Type 
1
 and Type 
2
 audits.

The CTO and CISO also have weekly and monthly meetings with senior executive management to discuss security strategy, projects, and concerns.

We have an established incident response process led by our CISO governing our assessment, response, and notifications internally and externally upon the occurrence of a cybersecurity incident. 
Depending on the nature and severity of an incident, this process provides for escalating notification to our Chief Executive Officer, executive management team, and the Board as well as regulatory notifications depending on the jurisdiction and specifications of the incident.

30

While we evaluate all security incidents and consider the materiality of individual or combined incidents, to date, no incidents or combination of incidents have materially affected the Company or our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. We continue to invest in cybersecurity to enhance the design and effectiveness of our internal controls and processes to protect our systems, networks, and integrity of our data.

Our approach to cybersecurity risk management includes the following key areas:

Risk Management and Policies - 
Our policies, standards, processes, and practices for assessing, identifying, and managing risks, including material risks, from cybersecurity threats 
are integrated
 into our overall security and risk management program and are based on frameworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”), the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO"), and other applicable industry standards and best practices.

We regularly review and update policies and procedures with input from IT and security leadership and industry security standards including PCI DSS and ISO.

Business segments and local entities also maintain local policies and procedures that include global requirements and local, statutory, or contractual requirements and escalations.

All employees must sign and acknowledge a Corporate Information Security Policy that outlines their responsibilities related to IT security, cybersecurity, and protection of company assets and data.

In addition to the enterprise risk assessment presented to the Board, local entity IT and security teams maintain detailed risk assessments that are shared with local management and are provided for applicable regulatory requirements, as well.

Information Sharing and Collaboration - 
We subscribe to financial services cyber intelligence and collaboration services, and we work closely with cyber intelligence and managed security service providers to augment our own security program and controls.

We investigate intelligence sharing platforms to assess potential risks as credible or emerging risks.

Continuous Monitoring – 
We have security team members across all of our geographic business operations that support our key IT processing centers.

We have teams dedicated to investigating all security alerts and incidents at a global level or within our business segments.

Further, we have managed security service providers who provide 
24
x
7
 advanced threat detection and monitoring services to augment our security analyst teams.

Incident Response – 
We have a global incident response policy that is shared with key stakeholders and outlines our classification, escalation, investigation, reporting, and overall response procedures depending on the classification and severity of incidents.

Local IT teams must also create a local incident response plan and playbooks for addressing various types of incidents and handling escalations and reporting obligations locally.

Further, we engage external forensic investigations as necessary to augment our incident reporting process if deemed critical and/or necessary for prompt response to security incidents which may require a higher technical level of forensics and/or resources to quickly assess and respond to certain incidents.

Training and

Awareness
 - We provide security awareness training to our employees and contractors to help identify, mitigate, and report on cybersecurity threats. Our employees with network access must complete quarterly security awareness training which includes multiple interactive and video training modules with passing scores required to complete training compliance. We require annual PCI DSS and GDPR training as well as any other regulatory required security training.

We also perform simulated phishing campaigns to further test security training effectiveness. We also periodically host tabletop exercises with IT and management to test and evaluate our incident response plan or playbooks.

Insider Threats
 - We implement insider threat controls designed to identify, assess, and address potential risks from within our Company. We implement controls and tools to alert on suspicious or unusual insider activity, and we have rigorous controls in place to prevent data loss and external sharing of company information. We consider and evaluate potential risks consistent with industry practices, customer requirements and applicable law, including privacy and other considerations.

Third Party Risk Assessments
 - We conduct information security assessments before sharing or allowing the hosting of data in computing environments managed by third parties or allowing third parties to connect to our environment.

We also review and amend legal terms and conditions to ensure there are contractual provisions requiring certain security protections and incident reporting.

We also perform vendor risk assessments to assess the risk of new and existing vendors we conduct business with.

External Assessments – 
We engage external assessors to evaluate, test, and conclude on the design and effectiveness of security controls and processes. We engage quality assessors for vulnerability and penetration testing as well as for security certification and/or regulatory requirements.

Further, we have external audits performed by customers, banking and government regulators, and public accounting firms as part of financial and statutory audit purposes. 
In 
2024
, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.
 However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that we have not experienced undetected cybersecurity incidents.

For more information on security and cybersecurity threats we face, please see “Risk Factors.”

Legal Proceedings

The Company is, from time to time, a party to legal or regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. 

The discussion regarding litigation in Part II, Item 
8
 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Note 
20
, Litigation and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report is incorporated herein by reference.

From time to time, the Company is a party to legal or regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company records a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
 Currently
, there are no legal proceeding s or regulatory findings which are both probable that a liability has been incurred and can be reasonably estimated that management believes, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.

During July 2024, the
Company received an adverse judicial decision related to withholding taxes on
certain agency relationships in Italy within the Money Transfer Segment, which
the Company has appealed. In January 2025, the Company received a positive
judicial decision in the same court related to the same issue but corresponding
to a different taxable period. The Company completed an assessment and
concluded that it is reasonably possible that a liability has been
incurred, but not probable. 
The principal amount of the agent-based withholding tax could be approximately $
16.5
 million for all open periods.

We have 
six
 processing centers in Europe, 
five
 in Asia Pacific and 
two
 in North America. 
We have 
35
 principal offices in Europe, 
14
 in Asia Pacific, 
10
 in North America, 
three
 in the Middle East, 
two

 Our executive offices are located in Leawood, Kansas, USA. 
With approximately 
76
%
 of our
 revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, 
any significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates will 
likely have a significant impact on our results of operations (for a further discussion, see Item 
1
A - Risk Factors and Item 
7
A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).

Sources of Revenues and Cash Flow

Euronet earns revenues and income primarily from ATM management fees, transaction fees, commissions, and foreign currency exchange margin. Each operating segment's sources of revenue are described below.

EFT Processing Segment

— Revenues in the EFT Pro
cessing Segment, which represented approximately

29%

of total consolidated revenues for the year ended 

December 31, 2024
, are derived from fees charged for transactions made by cardholders on our proprietary network of ATMs, fixed management fees and transaction fees we charge to customers for operating ATMs and processing debit and credit cards under outsourcing and cross-border acquiring agreements, foreign currency exchange margin on DCC transactions, domestic and international surcharge, foreign currency dispensing and other value added services such as advertising, prepaid telecommunication recharges, bill payment, and money transfers provided

 over ATMs. Revenues in this segment are also derived from cardless payments, banknote recycling, tax refund services, license fees, professional services and maintenance fees for proprietary applicati
on software and sales of related hardware.

epay Segment

— Revenues in the epay Segment, which represented approximately

29%

of total consolidated revenues for the year ended 

December 31, 2024
, are primarily derived from commissions or processing fees rec
eived from mobile phone operators for the processing and distribution of prepaid mobile airtime and commissions earned from the distribution of other electronic content, vouchers, and physical gifts. The proportion of epay Segment revenues earned from the distribution of prepaid mobile phone time as compared with other electronic products has decreased over time, and digital media content now produces approximately 
68
%

of epay Segment revenues. Other electronic content offered by this segment includes digital content such as music, games, and software, as well as other products including prepaid long distance calling card plans, prepaid Internet plans, prepaid debit cards, gift cards, vouchers, transport payments, lottery payments, bill payment, and money transfer.

Money Transfer Segment

— Revenues in the Money Transfer Segment, which represented approximately

42%

of total consolidated revenues for the year ended 

December 31, 2024
, are primarily derived from transaction fees, as well as the margin earned from purchasing foreign currency 
at wholesale exchange rates and selling the foreign currency to customers at retail exchange rates. We have a sending agent network in place comprised of agents, customer service representatives, Company-owned stores, primarily in North America, Europe and Malaysia, Ria, and xe branded websites, along with a worldwide network of correspondent agents, consisting primarily of financial institutions in the transfer destination countries. 
Under the brand "Dandelion", Ria offers payment processing services to third party partners. The Dandelion cross-border payments platform provides financial institutions, fintechs such as digital wallets and banks, and enterprise software companies access to Euronet's money transfer network through an API connection.
 Sending and correspondent agents each earn fees for cash collection and distribution services, which are recognized as direct operating costs at the time of sale.

35

Corporate Services, Eliminations and Other

— In addition to operating in our principal operating segments described above, our "Corporate Services, Eliminations and Other" category includes non-operating activity, certain inter-segment eliminations and the cost of providing corporate and other administrative services to the operating segments, including most share-based compensation expenses. These services are not directly identifiable with our reportable operating segments. 

Opportunities and Challenges

The global

product markets in which we operate are large and fragmented, which poses both opportunities and challenges for our technology to disrupt new and existing competition. As an organization, our focus is on increasing our market presence through both physical (ATMs, POS terminals, stores, and agent correspondents) and digital assets and providing new and improved products and services for customers through all of our channels, which may in turn drive an increase in the number of transactions on our networks. Each of these opportunities also presents us with challenges, including differentiating our portfolio of products and services in highly competitive markets, the successful development and implementation of our software products and access to financing for expansion.

1
) The EFT Processing Segment opportunities include physical expansion into target markets, developing value added products or services, increasing high value DCC and surcharge transactions and efficiently leveraging our portfolio of software solutions. Our opportunities are dependent on renewing and expanding our card acceptance, ATM and POS management and outsourcing, cash supply and other commercial agreements with customers and financial institutions. Operational challenges in the EFT Processing Segment include obtaining and maintaining the required licenses and sponsorship agreements in markets in which we operate and navigating frequently changing rules imposed by international card organizations, such as Visa
®
 and Mastercard
®
, that govern ATM interchange fees, direct access fees and other restrictions. Our profitability is dependent on the laws and regulations that govern DCC transactions, specifically in the E.U., increasing expansion of prepaid forex cards, as well as the laws and regulations of each country that we operate in that may impact the volume of cross-border and cross-currency transactions
. The timing and amount of revenues in the EFT Processing Segment is uncertain and unpredictable due to inherent limitations in managing our estate of ATMs, which is dependent on contracts that cover large numbers of ATMs, which are complicated by legal and regulatory considerations of local countries, as well as our customers' decisions whether to outsource ATMs.

2
) 
The epay Segment opportunities include renewing existing and negotiating new agreements in target markets in which we operate, primarily with mobile operators, digital content providers, financial institutions, and retailers. The overall growth rate in the prepaid mobile phone and digital media content markets, shifts between prepaid and postpaid services, and our market share in those respective markets will have a significant impact on our ability to maintain and grow the epay Segment revenues. There is significant competition in these markets that may impact our ability to grow organically and increase the margin we earn and the margin that we pay to retailers. The profitability of the epay Segment is dependent on our ability to adapt to new technologies that may compete with POS distribution of digital content and prepaid mobile airtime, as well as our ability to leverage cross-selling opportunities with our EFT and Money Transfer Segments. The epay Segment opportunities may be impacted by government-imposed restrictions on retailers and/or content providers

with whom we partner in countries in which we have a presence, and corresponding licensure requirements mandated upon such parties to legally operate in such countries.

36

3
) The Money Transfer Segment opportunities include expanding our portfolio of products and services to new and existing customers around the globe, which in turn may lead to an increase in transaction volumes. The opportunities to expand are contingent on our ability to effectively leverage our network of bank accounts for digital money transfer delivery, maintaining our physical agent network, cross selling opportunities with our EFT and epay segments and our penetration into high growth money transfer corridors. The challenges inherit in these opportunities include maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements, maintaining all required

licenses, ensuring the recoverability of funds advanced to agents and the continued reliance on the technologies required to operate our business. The volume of transactions processed on our network is impacted by shifts in our customer base, which can change rapidly with worker migration patterns and changes in unbanked populations across the globe. Foreign regulations that impact cross-border migration patterns

and the money transfer markets can significantly impact our ability to grow the number of transactions on our network.

For all segments, our continued expansion may involve additional acquisitions that could divert our resources and management time and require integration of new assets with our existing networks and services. Our ability to effectively manage our growth has required us to expand our operating systems and employee base, particularly at the management level, which has added incremental operating costs. An inability to continue to effectively manage expansion could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, financial condition, or results of operations. Inadequate technology and resources would impair our ability to maintain current processing technology and efficiencies, as well as deliver new and innovative services to compete in the marketplace.

Summary

Our annual consolidated revenues 
increased
 by 
8.2%
 for 

2024
 compared to 

2023
.

The increase in revenues for 

2024
 was primarily 
due to the increases in transaction volumes across all 
three

segments.

Our annual consolidated operating income increased by 
16.3%
 for 
2024
 compared to 
2023
. The increase in operating income for

2024
 was
 primarily due to the increases in transaction volumes across all 
three
 segments.

Net income attributable to Euronet for 

2024
 was 
$
306.0
 million
, or 
$
6.45
 per diluted share compared to a net income attributable
 to Euronet for 
2023
 of $
279.7
 million, or $
5.50
 per
 diluted share.

Impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

Our revenues and local expenses are recorded in the functional currencies of our operating entities and then are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes; therefore, amounts we earn outside the U.S. are negatively impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar and positively impacted by a weaker U.S. dollar. Considering the results by country and the associated functional currency, our 

2024
 consolidated operating income was approximately 
0.1
% higher due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates when compared to 

2023
. If significant, in our discussion we will refer to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in our comparison of operating segment results.

To provide further perspective on the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the following table shows the changes in values relative to the U.S. dollar during 

2024

and 

2023
, of the currencies of the countries in which we have our most significant operations:

Foreign currency exchange loss, net

Foreign currency exchange activity includes gains and losses on certain foreign currency exchange derivative contracts and the impact of re-measurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of each of our subsidiaries give rise to foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses that result from re-measurement of these assets and liabilities are recorded in net income. The majority of our foreign currency exchange gains or losses are due to the re-measurement of intercompany loans which are not considered a long-term investment in nature and are in a currency other than the functional currency of 
one
 of the parties to the loan. For example, we make intercompany loans based in euros from our corporate division, which is composed of U.S. dollar functional currency entities, to certain European entities that use the euro as the functional currency. As the U.S. dollar strengthens against the euro, foreign currency exchange losses are recognized by our corporate entities because the number of euros to be received in settlement of the loans decreases in U.S. dollar terms. Conversely, in this example, in periods where the U.S. dollar weakens, our corporate entities will record foreign currency exchange gains.

We recorded a net foreign currency exchange loss of 
$
19.1
 million
 for the year
 ended 
December 31, 2024
, 
compared to a net foreign currency exchange gain of $
8.0
 million for the same period in 
2023
. These realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses reflect the fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of the countries in which we operated during the respective periods.

We calculate our effective income tax rate by dividing income tax expense by pre-tax book income. Our effective income tax rates were 
31.8
% and 
30.2
% for the years ended 
December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, respectively. The effective income tax rates were influenced by the impact of foreign currency exchange gains (losses). Excluding foreign currency exchange gains (losses) as well as the related tax effects for these items, our adjusted effective income tax rates were 
30.0
% and 
32.0
% for the years ended 
December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, respectively.

The effective income tax rate, as adjusted, for 2024 was higher than the applicable statutory income tax rate of 
21
% primarily because of certain foreign earnings being subject to higher local statutory tax rates.

The effective income tax rate, as adjusted, for 2023 was higher than the applicable statutory income tax rate of 
21
% 
primarily because of the projected utilization of U.S. tax benefits, and certain foreign earnings being subject to higher local statutory tax rates. We determine income tax expense based upon enacted tax laws applicable in each of the taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business. Based on our interpretation of such laws and considering the evidence of available facts and circumstances and baseline operating forecasts, we have accrued the estimated income tax effects of certain transactions, business ventures, contract and organizational structures, and the estimated future reversal of timing differences. Should a taxing jurisdiction change its laws or dispute our conclusions, or should management become aware of new facts or other evidence that could alter our conclusions, the resulting impact to our estimates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Income before income taxes, as adjusted, income tax expense, as adjusted and effective income tax rate, as adjusted, are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that management believes are useful for understanding why our effective income tax rates are significantly different than would be expected. These non-U.S. GAAP measures are used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its regular review of operating results for the periods presented.

Our total liability for uncertain tax positions under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740-10-25 and -30 was $
48.6
 million as of 
December 31, 2024
. 
The application of ASC 740-10-25 and -30 requires significant judgment in assessing the outcome of future income tax examinations and their potential impact on the Company's estimated effective income tax rate and the value of deferred tax assets, such as those related to the Company's net operating loss carryforwards. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months, as a result of the resolution of audit examinations and expirations of certain statutes of limitations and, accordingly, materially affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the range of change due to the uncertainty of potential outcomes.

Net (Income) Loss Attributable To Non-controlling Interests

Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Euronet

Net income attributable to Euronet was $

 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, an increase of $
26.3
 million compared to net income in the same period in 
2023
. For the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, the increase in net income was primarily attributable to the $
135.3
 million increase in gross profit driven by an increase in transaction volumes across all 
three
 segments and an increase in other gains of $
21.3
 million, partially offset by a $
47.3
 million increase in salaries and benefits, a
 $
27.1
 million foreign currency exchange loss, a $
16.3
 million increase in interest expenses 
and a $
21.7
 million increase in income tax expense.
Translation Adjustment

Translation gains and losses are the result of translating our foreign entities' balance sheets from local functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency prior to consolidation and are recorded in comprehensive (loss) income. As required by U.S. GAAP, during this translation process, asset and liability accounts are translated at current foreign currency exchange rates and equity accounts are translated at historical rates. Historical rates represent the rates in effect when the balances in our equity accounts were originally created. By using this mix of rates to convert the balance sheet from functional currency to U.S. dollars, differences between current and historical exchange rates generate this translation adjustment.

We recorded a net
 loss
 on translation adjustments of 
$
117.8
 million

for

2024

and a net gain of
 $
47.9
 million

 for 

2023
. In 
2024
, the U.S. dollar strengthened compared to key foreign currencies, resulting in translation losses which were recorded in comprehensive (loss) income. 
In 
2023
, the U.S. dollar weakened compared to key foreign currencies, resulting in translation gains which were recorded in comprehensive (loss) income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Working capital

As of 
December 31, 2024
, we had working capital of $
810.5
 million, which is calculated as the difference between total current assets and total current liabilities, compared to working capital of $
1,462.1
 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in working capital was due to several changes in working capital line items, mainly due to 
2023
 ending in the weekend, which increased funding needs for our money transfer agents. 2024 ended on a Tuesday, which impacted our working capital line items positively as balances were settled before year-end. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 
1.25
 and 
1.54
 at 
December 31, 2024
 and 
December 31, 2023
, respectively.

47

We require substantial working capital to finance operations. The Money Transfer Segment funds the payout of the majority of our consumer-to-consumer money transfer services before receiving the benefit of amounts collected from customers by agents. Working capital needs increase due to weekends and banking holidays. As a result, we may report more or less working capital for the Money Transfer Segment based solely upon the day on which the 
reporting period ends. The epay Segment produces positive working capital, but much of it is restricted in connection with the administration of its customer collection and vendor remittance activities. In our EFT Processing Segment, we obtain a significant portion of the cash required to operate our ATMs through various cash supply arrangements, the amount of which is not recorded on Euronet's
 Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, in certain countries, we fund the cash required to operate our ATM network from borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and cash flows from operations
. As of 
December 31, 2024
, we had approximately 
$
643.8
 million 
of our own cash in use or designated for use in our ATM network, which is recorded in ATM cash on Euronet's Consolidated Balance Sheets. ATM cash increased $
118.6
 million from $
525.2
 million as of 
December 31, 2023
 to $
643.8

December 31, 2024
 compared to $
1,254.2

 The Company has access to $
2,289.8

Other sources of capital

Credit Facility
 - O
n December 17, 2024, the Company amended its revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) to increase the facility from $1.25

billion to $1.9

billion and to extend the expiration to December 17, 2029. 
The amended Credit Facility includes a multi-currency borrowing tranche totaling $1,685 million 
and a USD borrowing tranche totaling $215 million
. The amended Credit Facility also removes the credit spread adjustment on SOFR and SONIA borrowings. All other terms remain substantially the same as the previous Credit Facility.

The 
multi-currency tranche of the 
 revolving credit facility contains a sublimit of up to $
500
 million for the issuance of letters of credit, a $
75
 million sublimit for U.S. dollar swingline loans and a $
75
 million sublimit for swingline loans in euros 
or British pounds sterling. 
The 
multi-currency tranche of the 
 Credit Facility allows for borrowings in British pounds sterling, euro and U.S. dollars. Subject to certain conditions, the Company has the option to increase the Credit Facility by up to an additional $
500
 million by requesting additional commitments from existing or new lenders.

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (other than swing line loans) bear interest on a margin over a secured financing rate or the base rate, as selected by the Co
mpany, which varies from 0.875% to 1.375%, in each case based on the Company’s current credit rating. The applicable margin for borrowings under the Credit Facility, based on the Company’s current credit rating is 1.075%.

In addition, the Company pays a facility fee on the total commitments made under the Revolving Credit Facility, which varies from 0.125% to 0.250%.

The current facility fee is 0.175%.

As of 
December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, the stand-by letters of credit interest charges were each 
1.25
% per annum. Borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024 was $
1,335.1
 million. 
The weighted-average interest rate of the Company's borrowings under the Credit Facility from 
January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 was 
6.39
%
.

Uncommitted Line of Credit
 - 
On June 21, 2024, the Company rolled its existing $
150
 million Uncommitted Loan Agreement into a new Uncommitted Loan Agreement with a $
400

million credit limit through September 30, 2024, and a credit limit of $
250

million thereafter for the sole purpose of providing vault cash for ATMs and expires no later than

June 20, 2025
. 
The loan had an outstanding balance of $
250

million at
 December 31
, 2024.

The loan is a Prime Rate Loan, a

Daily SOFR Rate Loan

plus

1.05
% or shall bear interest at the rate agreed to by the Bank and the Company at the time such Loan is made. The weighted-average interest rate from loan inception date to
 December
 31, 2024
, was
 6.07
%. 

Convertible debt

- On March 18, 2019, we completed the sale of $
525.0

million in principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due

2049

(“Convertible Notes”). The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 18, 
2019
 (the “Indenture”), by and between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Convertible Notes have an interest rate of 
0.75
% per annum payable semi-annually in March and September and are convertible into shares of 
Euronet
 common stock at a conversion price of approximately $
188.73
 per share if certain conditions are met (relating to the closing prices of 
Euronet
 common stock exceeding certain thresholds for specified periods). Holders of the Convertible Notes have the option to require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes on each of March 15, 2025, 
2029
, 
2034
, 
2039
 and 
2044
 at a repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the relevant repurchase date. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we recorded $
12.8
 million in debt issuance costs, which are being amortized through March 1, 2025. 
The Company has a March 15, 2025 put date on the $525 million Convertible Notes, requiring us to issue a notice informing the market of this put date. Given current bond trading levels and our share price, we anticipate that bondholders will exercise their put option and as a result the Convertible Notes are classified as short-term obligations. 
As noted above, the holders of the Convertible Notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase their Convertible Notes on March 15, 2025. Given current bond trading levels and the Company’s share price, the Company anticipates that holders of the Convertible Notes will exercise their repurchase option and as a result the Convertible Notes are classified as short-term obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024.

49

Senior Notes
 - 
On May 22, 2019, we completed the sale of €
600
 million ($
669.9
 million) aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes that mature in May 2026 (the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes accrue interest at a rate of 
1.375
% per year, payable annually in arrears commencing May 22, 2020, until maturity or earlier redemption. As of 
December 31, 2024
, we have outstanding €
600
 million ($
621.5
 million) principal amount of the Senior Notes. In addition, the Company may redeem some or all of these notes on or after February 22, 2026 at their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. As of 
December 31, 2024
, we had $
1.7
 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Senior Notes.

Other debt obligations

— Certain of our subsidiaries have available credit lines and overdraft facilities to generally supplement short-term working capital requirements, when necessary. There were $
37.7
 million and 
$
0.3
 million
 outstanding under these other obligation arrangements as of 
December 31, 2024

and 
December 31, 2023
. 
On October 9, 2024, the Company completed a facility of MYR

140

million and an overdraft facility of MYR

100

million for its Malaysian business. Each advance under this facility shall be made for a term of 1 month or such other period of up to 12 months. As of

December 31, 2024

$37.4 million was borrowed under this facility.

Other uses of capital

Capital expenditures and needs
— Total capital expenditures for 
2024

were 
$
117.2
 million
. These capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of ATMs to expand our IAD network in Europe, the purchase and installation of ATMs in key under-penetrated markets, the purchase of POS ter
minals for the epay
 and Money Transfer Segments, and office, data center and company store computer equipment and software. 
Total capital expenditures for 
2025

are currently estimated to be approximately 
$85 
million to 
$95 
million.

Contractual lease obligations

—
 We have entered into contractually binding operating and finance lease commitments to operate the business. Operating lease expenses were 
$
51.6
 million and $
50.1
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, respectively. Finance lease expenses were not material for 
2024
 or 
2023
. 
For additional information on operating and finance lease obligations, see 
Note 
14
, Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

At current and projected cash flow levels, we anticipate that cash generated from operations, together with cash on hand and amounts available under our Credit Facility and other existing and potential future financing will be sufficient to meet our debt, leasing, and capital expenditure obligations. If our capital resources are not sufficient to meet these obligations, we will seek to refinance our debt and/or issue additional equity under terms acceptable to us. However, we can offer no assurances that we will be able to obtain favorable terms for the refinancing of any of our debt or other obligations or for the issuance of additional equity.

Share repurchase plan

The repurchase program, initiated on September 13, 2022, to repurchase up to $
350
 million in value, but not more than 
7.0
 million shares of common stock through September 13, 2024, has been completed. 
During 2024, we repurchased 850,528 shares under the repurchase program at a weighted average purchase price of $113.63 for a total value of $96.6 million.

On September 13, 2023, the Company initiated a repurchase program to repurchase up to $
350
 million in value, but not more than 
7.0
 million shares of common stock through September 13, 2025.
 During 2024
, we repurchased 1,625,005 
shares under the repurchase program at a weighted average purchase price of 
$103.73 
for a total value of 
$168.6 million. 

On September 11, 2024, the Company initiated a repurchase program to repurchase up to $
350
 million in value, but not more than 
7.0
 million shares of common stock through September 11, 2026.
 During 2024, the Company did not repurchase shares under this plan.

Repurchases under the programs may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including derivative transactions, and may be made under a Rule

plan.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in August 2022. Among other things, it imposes a 
1
% excise tax on net share repurchases.

Inflation and functional currencies

Generally, the countries in which we operate have experienced low and stable inflation in recent years, further the local currency in each of these markets is the functional currency. Currently, we do not believe that inflation will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position. We continually review inflation and the functional currency in each of the countries where we operate.

Off-balance sheet arrangements

We have certain significant off-balance sheet items described in Note 
21
, Commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On occasion, we grant guarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries, and we sometimes enter into agreements with unaffiliated third parties that contain indemnification provisions, the terms of which may vary depending on the negotiated terms of each respective agreement. Our liability under such indemnification provisions may be subject to time and materiality limitations, monetary caps and other conditions and defenses. To date, we are not aware of any significant claims made by the indemnified parties or parties to whom we have provided guarantees on behalf of our subsidiaries and, accordingly, no liabilities have been recorded as of 
December 31, 2024
.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Management considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if it requires the use of assumptions that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and if changes in the estimate or selection of a different estimate could have a material effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Our most critical estimates and assumptions are used for computing income taxes, allocating the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions, and potential impairment of intangible assets and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. For a summary of all of the Company's significant accounting policies, see Note 
3
, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices, to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting for income taxes

The deferred income tax effects
 of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded under the asset and liability method prescribed under ASC Topic 
740
,

Income Taxes

("ASC 
740
"). This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment. The consolidated statement of operations effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes, net of valuation allowances, on the ba
lance sheet as measured by differences in the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities.

We have significant tax loss carryforwards, and other temporary differences, which are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets realizable in future periods are recorded net of a valuation allowance based on an assessment of each entity, or group of entities', ability to generate sufficient taxable income within an appropriate period, in a specific tax jurisdiction.

In assessing the recognition of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. As more fully described in Note

, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, gross deferred tax assets were

$
225.0
 million

 as of 

December 31, 2024
, partially offset by a valuation allowance of

$
75.0
 million
. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We make judgments and estimates on the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, historical and projected future taxable income in each country in which we operate, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.

Based upon the level of historical taxable income and current projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowance at 

December 31, 2024
. If we have a history of generating taxable income in a certain country in which we operate, and baseline forecasts project continued taxable income in this country, we will reduce the valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we expect to realize.

51

Additionally, we follow the provisions of ASC 740-10-25 and -
30
 to account for uncertainty in income tax positions. Applying the standard requires substantial management judgment and use of estimates in determining whether the impact of a tax position is "more likely than not" of being sustained on audit by the relevant taxing authority. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. It is reasonably possible that amounts reserved for potential exposure could change significantly as a result of the conclusion of tax examinations and, accordingly, materially affect our operating results.

Business combinations

In accordance with ASC 
Topic 
805
,

Business Combinations

("ASC 
805
"), we allocate the acquisition purchase price of an acquired entity to the assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Management applies various valuation methodologies to these acquired assets and assumed liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued. Examples o
f such items include loans, deposits, identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities acquired or assumed in business combinations. Management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items, including projected cash flows and discount rates. For larger or more complex acquisitions, we generally obtain third-party valuations to assist us in 
estimating fair values. The use of different valuation techniques and assumptions could change the amounts and useful lives assigned to the assets and liabilities acquired and related amortization expense. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed 
one
 year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.

Goodwill and intangible assets

In accordance with ASC Topic 
350
, 
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other 
(“ASC 
350
”)
, 
we evaluate the carrying value of our indefinite-lived assets, including goodwill, at least annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired, or in the case of goodwill, that the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. Our annual impairment tests are performed during the fourth quarter and are performed at the reporting unit level. Our annual process for evaluating goodwill allows us to perform a qualitative assessment for all reporting units, and then perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test for those reporting units in which it is deemed necessary. The qualitative factors evaluated by the Company include: economic conditions of the local business environment, overall financial performance, sensitivity analysis from the most recent quantitative test, and other entity specific factors as deemed appropriate. If we determine a quantitative goodwill impairment test is appropriate, the test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, after any long-lived asset impairment charges. Generally, the fair value is determined using discounted projected future cash flows and market multiple of earnings. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. Determining the fair value of reporting units requires significant management judgment in estimating future cash flows and assessing potential market and economic conditions. It is reasonably possible that our operations will not perform as expected, or that estimates or assumptions could change, which may result in the recording of material non-cash impairment charges during the year in which these determinations take place.

Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our finite-intangible assets, as a part of our long-lived assets, for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely 

independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to its fair value. In addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized bala
nce would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.

As of 

December 31, 2024
, the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes goodwill of 
$
859.2
 million

 and acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of 
$
188.9
 million. For the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, no impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets has been identified.

Item 
7
A. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest rate risk 

As of December 31
, 
2024
, our total debt outstanding, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, was 
$
1,954.6
 million
. Of this amount, 
$
525
 million,
 or 
27
%
 of our total debt obligations, relates to our Convertible Notes that have a fixed coupon rate. Our $
525.0
 million outstanding principal amount of Convertible Notes accrues cash interest at a rate of 
0.75
% of the principal amount per annum. Based on quoted market prices, as of 
December 31, 2024
, the fair value of our fixed rate Convertible Notes was 
$
515.4
 million
, compared to a carrying value of 
$
525.0
 million
. Further, as 
of 
December 31, 2024
,
 we had 
$
520.4
 million outstanding
 under our Credit Facility, or

27
%
 of our total debt obligations. 
If we were to maintain these borrowings for 
one
 year and maximize the potential borrowings available under the revolving credit facility for 
one
 year, a 
1
% (
100
 basis points) increase in the applicable interest rate would result in additional interest expense to the Company of approximately $19 million. 
The carrying value of the Credit Facility approximates fair value because interest as of 
December 31, 2024
, was based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) that reset at various intervals of less than 
one
 year.
 Additionally, 
$
621.5
 million
, or 
32
%
 of our total debt obligations, relates to Senior Notes having a fixed coupon rate. Our €
600.0
 million outstanding principal amount of Senior Notes accrues cash interest at a rate of 
1.375
% of the principal per annum. Based on quoted market prices, as of 
December 31, 2024
, the fair value of our fixed rate Senior Notes was 
$
604.8
 million
, compared to a carrying value of 
$
621.5
 million
. 
Also, $
250.0
 million, or 
13
% of our total debt obligations, relates to an Uncommitted Loan Agreement
, 
fully drawn and outstanding at December 31, 2024, 
for the sole purpose of providing vault cash for ATMs, that expires no later than 
June 20, 2025.

The loan is a Prime Rate Loan, a

Daily SOFR Rate Loan

plus

1.05
% or shall bear interest at the rate agreed to by the Bank and the Company at the time such loan is made.

The remaining 
$
37.7
 million
, or less than 
2
%
 of our total debt obligations, is related to borrowings by certain subsidiaries to fund, from time to time, working capital requirements. 

Our excess cash is invested in instruments with original maturities of 
three
 months or less or in certificates of deposit that may be withdrawn at any time without penalty; therefore, as investments mature and are reinvested, the amount we earn will increase or decrease with changes in the underlying short-term interest rates.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk

For the years ended 

December 31, 2024

and

2023
, 
76
%

of our revenues were generated in non-U.S. dollar countries. We expect to continue generating a significant portion of our revenues in countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

We are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates of the U.S. dollar to the currencies of countries in which we have significant operations, primarily the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Polish zloty, Indian rupee, New Zealand dollar, Malaysian ringgit and Hungarian forint. As of 
December 31, 2024
, we estimate that a 
10
% fluctuation in these foreign currency exchange rates would have the combined annualized effect on reported net 
income and working capital of approximately 
$
115
 million
 to 
$
125
 million
. This effect is estimated by applying a 
10
% adjustment factor to our non-U.S. dollar results from operations, intercompany loans that generate foreign currency gains or losses and working capital balances that require translation from the respective functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency.

Additionally, we have other non-current, non-U.S. dollar assets and liabilities on our balance sheet that are translated to the U.S. dollar during consolidation. These items primarily represent goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions in countries other than the U.S. We estimate that a 
10
% fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates would have a non-cash impact on total comprehensive (loss) income of approximately (
$
80
)
 million
 to
 (
$
90
)

million
 as a result of the change in value of these items during translation to the U.S. dollar. For the fluctuations described above, a strengthening U.S. dollar produces a financial loss, while a weakening U.S. dollar produces a financial gain. 

54

We believe this quantitative measure has inherent limitations and does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing or operating strategies. Because a majority of our revenues and expenses are incurred in the functional currencies of our international operating entities, the profits we earn in foreign currencies are positively impacted by a weakening of the U.S. dollar and negatively impacted by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Additionally, our debt obligations are primarily in U.S. dollars; therefore, as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, the amount available for repayment of debt will also increase or decrease. 

We use derivatives to minimize our exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to facilitate foreign currency risk management services by writing derivatives to customers. 

Derivatives are used to manage the overall market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates; however, we do not perform the extensive record-keeping required to account for the derivative transactions as hedges. Due to the relatively short duration of the derivative contracts, we use the derivatives primarily as economic hedges. Since we do not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards, we record gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives in earnings in the period of change.

A majority of our consumer-to-consumer money transfer operations involve receiving and disbursing different currencies, 

in which we earn a foreign currency spread based on the difference between buying currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the currency to consumers at retail exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency forward and cross-currency swap contracts to minimize exposure related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The changes in fair value related to these contracts are recorded in Foreign currency exchange (loss) gain, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of 

December 31, 2024
, we had foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of

$
281.5
 million, primarily in Australian dollars, British pounds, Canadian dollars, euros and Mexican pesos, that were not designated as hedges and mature within a few days.

For derivative instruments our xe operations write to customers, we aggregate the foreign currency exposure arising from customer contracts and hedge the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties as part of a broader foreign currency portfolio. The changes in fair value related to the total portfolio of positions are recorded in Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of 

December 31, 2024
, we held foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding with a notional value of

$
0.9
 billion, primarily in U.S. dollars, euros, British pounds, Australian dollars, and New Zealand dollars, that were not designated as hedges and for which the majority mature within the next 
twelve
 months.

We use longer-term foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain foreign currency denominated other asset and liability positions. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with a notional value of 
$
710.4

million, primarily in euros.

Euronet Worldwide, Inc.:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Euronet Worldwide, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31,
2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively,
the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these
consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. 

 Our audits of the consolidated financial
statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

57

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Critical Audit Matter

 The
critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current
period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex
judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any
way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and
we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a
separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures
to which it relates. 

Sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company earned $4.0 billion of revenue in 2024. The Company
earned revenue by payment and transaction processing and distribution solutions
to financial institutions, retailers, service providers and individual
consumers (collectively services). The services were provided to customers in approximately 200 countries through 67 worldwide offices within 3 different
reportable operating segments. 

We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit
evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. The Company’s geographical
dispersion of services worldwide, amongst various business lines required
especially subjective auditor judgment in evaluating the sufficiency of audit
evidence over revenue. Further, our audit team consisted of auditors located in
various countries worldwide. This required especially challenging auditor
judgment in the level of audit procedures and supervision applied at each
country. 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to
address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine
the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue, including the
determination of locations at which those procedures were to be performed. At
each Company location selected, we: 

 evaluated
the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls
related to the Company’s revenue process, including controls over the accurate
recording of revenue amounts 

 assessed
the training and experience of the auditors on our audit team that were in
countries other than the United States 

tested a sample of individual revenue transactions by
comparing amounts recognized by the Company to relevant contracts and or
payment and transaction support.

 We
evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue by assessing
the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of such
evidence.

EURONET WORLDWIDE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(
1) Organization

Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (the "Company" or "Euronet") was established as a Delaware corporation on December 13, 1996 and succeeded Euronet Holding N.V. as the group holding company, which was founded and established in 
1994
. Euronet is a leading financial technology solutions and payments provider. Euronet offers payment and transaction processing and distribution solutions to financial institutions, retailers, service providers and individual consumers. Euronet's primary product offerings include comprehensive ATM, POS, card outsourcing, card issuing and merchant acquiring services, electronic distribution of prepaid mobile airtime and other electronic payment products, and international payment services.

(2) 
Basis of Preparation

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Euronet and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Euronet's investments in companies that it does not control, but has the ability to significantly influence, are accounted for under the equity method. Euronet has no variable interest entities. Results from operations related to entities acquired during the periods covered by the Consolidated Financial Statements are reflected from the effective date of acquisition.

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires that management make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include computing income taxes, contingent purchase price consideration, estimating the useful lives and potential impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, as well as allocating the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions and revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Seasonality

Euronet’s EFT Processing Segment normally experiences its heaviest demand for Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) services during the third quarter of the year, normally coinciding with the tourism season. Additionally, the EFT Processing and epay Segments are normally impacted by seasonality during the fourth quarter and first quarter of each year due to higher transaction levels during the holiday season and lower levels following the holiday season. Seasonality in the Money Transfer Segment varies by region of the world. In most markets, Euronet usually experiences increased demand for money transfer services from the month of May through the fourth quarter of each year, coinciding with the increase in worker migration patterns and various holidays, and its lowest transaction levels during the first quarter of the year.

(3) 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices

Foreign currencies

Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary are remeasured at rates of exchange on the balance sheet date. Resulting gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
The majority of our foreign currency exchange gains or losses are due to the 
remeasurement
 of intercompany loans which are not considered a long-term investment in nature and are in a currency other than the functional currency of 
one
 of the parties to the loan.

The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated to U.S. dollars using (i) exchange rates in effect at period end for assets and liabilities, and (ii) weighted average exchange rates during the period for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translation of such financial statements are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as a separate component of consolidated equity.

65

Cash equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments, with an original maturity of 
three
 months or less, and certificates of deposit, which may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Company without penalty, to be cash equivalents.

ATM cash

ATM cash represents cash within the ATM network either included within ATMs, within dedicated accounts, or in-transit to ATMs.

Settlement assets and obligations

Settlement assets represent funds received or to be received from agents for unsettled money transfers and from merchants for unsettled prepaid transactions.

See 
Note 
4
, Settlement Assets and Obligations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on settlement assets and obligations.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. 

Depreciation is generally calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.

Depreciation and amortization rates are generally as follows:

 ATMs or ATM upgrades 

5
 - 
8
 years 

 Computers and software 

3
 - 
5
 years 

 POS terminals 

3
 - 
5
 years 

 Vehicles and office equipment 

3
 - 
10
 years 

Leasehold improvements

Over the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life

Goodwill and ot
her intangible assets

Goodwill
 - The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 
350
, 
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other

 ("ASC 
350
"). In accordance with the requirements of ASC 
350

the Company tests for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances dictate. Goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or 
one
 level below an operating segment.

ASC 
350
 provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (more than 
50
%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform the existing quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.

Under the qualitative assessment, various events, and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators). These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. Furthermore, the Company considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares, among other factors, the weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") between the current and prior years for each reporting unit. 

66

Under the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The Company uses weighted results from the income approach or the discounted cash flow model ("DCF model") and guideline public company method ("Market Approach model") to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows and EBITDA are the best indicators of such fair value. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including sales volumes, gross margins, tax rates, capital spending, discount rates and working capital changes. Most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units. Significant assumptions in the Market Approach model are projected EBITDA, selected market multiple, and the estimated control premium. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized. 
The DCF Model and Market Approach Model utilize Level 
3
 inputs in the fair value hierarchy as they include unobservable inputs that require significant management assumptions.

Other Intangible Assets
 - In accordance with ASC 
350
, intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Unless otherwise noted, amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

 Non-compete agreements 

2
 - 
5
 years 

 Trademarks and trade names 

2
 - 
20
 years 

 Software 

3
 - 
10
 years 

 Customer relationships 

6
 - 
20
 years

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances are present, a loss is recognized if the carrying value of the asset is in excess of the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. 

See Note 
9
, Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets, Net, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.

Other assets

Other assets include capitalized software development costs and capitalized payments for new or renewed contracts. 

Euronet capitalizes initial payments for new or renewed contracts to the extent recoverable through future operations, contractual minimums and/or penalties in the case of early termination. The Company's accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given contract to the lesser of the estimated ongoing net future cash flows related to the contract or the termination fees the Company would receive in the event of early termination of the contract by the customer.

ASC Topic 
340
,

 Other Assets and Deferred Costs

("ASC 
340
") 
requires the deferral of incremental costs to fulfill customer contracts, known as contract assets, which are then amortized to expense as part of direct operating costs over the respective periods of expected benefit. D
eferred contract costs are reported on our 
balance sheet within current or non-current other assets based on the expected life of the related contract. At 
December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, we had
 $
97.4

million and $
78.4
 million, respectively, of deferred contract costs. For the years ended 
December 31, 2024
, 
2023

and 
2022
, w
e had
 $
23.4
 million, $
17.1
 million, and $
22.1
 million of amortization related to these costs, respectively. On a quarterly basis we evaluate the carrying amount of contract assets recognized to determine if there are contracts that may have a carrying amount in excess of the remaining future consideration to be received from the contract.

67

Convertible notes

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 
2020
-
06
, 
"Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity" 
which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating certain accounting models when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 
815
, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in-capital. Under this ASU, certain debt instruments with embedded conversion features will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. Additionally, this ASU eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective approach, which resulted in our Convertible Senior Notes due 
2049
 being recognized as a single liability. As a result of the adoption of this standard we recorded a $
99.7
 million decrease to additional paid-in capital, a $
56.8
 million decrease in debt discounts and a $
42.9
 million increase in retained earnings. The adoption of this standard also impacted our deferred tax liability by decreasing our deferred tax liability by $
15.0
 million, decreasing retained earnings by $
10.6
 million, and increasing additional paid-in capital by $
25.6
 million. Additionally, the elimination of the treasury stock method increases the number of dilutive shares used in the diluted earnings per share calculation, if dilutive, by 
2.8
 million shares.

Income taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

In accordance with ASC Topic 
740
, 

Income Taxes

 ("ASC 
740
"), the Company's policy is to record estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of 
Operations. See Note 
15
, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding these provisions. 

Presentation of taxes collected and remitted to governmental authorities

The Company presents taxes collected and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fair value measurements

The Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 
820
,

 Fair Value Measurements

 and Disclosures 

("ASC 
820
"), regarding fair value measurements for assets and liabilities. ASC 
820
 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions apply whenever other 
accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements. See Note 
19
, Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the required fair value disclosures.

Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

The Company accounts for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with ASC Topic 
815
,

 Derivatives and Hedging 

("ASC 
815
"), which requires that all derivative instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. Primarily in the Money Transfer Segment, the Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts, mainly
 forward contracts, to offset foreign currency exposure related to money transfer settlement assets and liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, derivative contracts written to its customers arising from its cross-currency money transfer services and certain assets and liability positions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts are considered derivative instruments under the provisions of ASC 
815
; however, the Company does not designate such instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, changes in the value of these contracts are recognized immediately as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Cash flows resulting from derivative instruments are included in operating activities in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company enters into derivative instruments with highly credit-worthy financial institutions and does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. See Note 
13
, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivative instruments
.

68

Share-based compensation

The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 
718
,

 Compensation - Stock 

Compensation 

("ASC 
718
"), for equity classified awards, which requires the determination of the fair value of the share-based compensation at the grant date and subsequent recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share-based compensation is earned ("requisite service period"). 

The amount of future compensation expense related to awards of nonvested shares or nonvested share units ("restricted stock") is based on the market price for Euronet Common Stock at the grant date. The grant dat
e is the date at which all key terms and conditions of the grant have been determined and the Company becomes contingently obligated to transfer equity to the employee who renders the requisite service, generally the date at which grants are approved by the Company's Board of Directors or Compensation Committee thereof. Share-based compensation expense for awards with only service conditions is generally recognized as expense on a "straight-line" basis over the requisite service period. For awards that vest based on achieving periodic performance conditions, expense is recognized on a "graded attribution method." The graded attribution method results in 
expense recognition on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of 
an award 
adjusted for any changes in probability of achievement of performance condition
. 
The Company has elected to use the "with and without method" when calculating the income tax benefit associated with its share-based payment arrangements. See Note 
17
, Stock Plans, for further disclosure.

Revenue recogni
tion

The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. A description of the major components of revenue by business segment is as follows:

EFT Processing
 - Revenues in the EFT Processing Segment are primarily derived from transaction and management fees and foreign currency exchange margin from owned and outsourced ATM, POS and card processing networks and from the sale of EFT software solutions for electronic payment and transaction delivery systems, and fees or margin earned from value added services, including dynamic currency conversion and domestic and international surcharge.

Transaction-based fees include charges for cash withdrawals, debit or credit card transactions, balance inquiries, transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization and prepaid mobile airtime recharges. Outsourcing services are generally billed on the basis of a fixed monthly fee per ATM, plus a transaction-based fee. Transaction-based fees are recognized at the time the transactions are processed and outsourcing management fees are recognized ratably over the contract period.

C
ertain

of the Company's non-cancelable customer contracts provide for the receipt of up-front fees from the customer and/or decreasing or increasing fee schedules over the agreement term for substantially the same level of services to be provided by the Company. The Company recognizes revenue under these contracts based on proportional performance of services over the term of the contract. This generally results in "straight-line" (i.e., consistent value per period) revenue recognition of the contracts' total cash flows, including any up-front payment received from the customer, which is recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt.

epay

-
 Revenue generated in the epay Segment is primarily derived from commis
sions or processing fees associated with distribution and/or processing of prepaid mobile airtime and digital media products. These fees and commissions are received from mobile operators, content vendors or distributors or from retailers. Commissions are recognized as revenue during the period in which the Company provides the service. The portion of the commission that is paid to retailers is generally recorded as a direct operating cost. In selling certain products, the Company is the p
rinciple obligor in th
e arrangements; accordingly, the gross sales value of the products is recorded as revenue and the purchase cost as direct operating cost. Transactions are processed through a network of POS terminals and direct connections to the electronic payment systems of retailers. Transaction processing fees are recognized at the time the transactions are processed.

Money Transfer

- 
R
evenues for money transfer and other services represent a transaction fee in addition to a margin earned from purchasing currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the currency to customers at retail exchange rates. Revenues and the associated direct operating cost are recognized at the time the transaction is processed. The Company has origination and distribution agents in place, which ea
ch earn a fee for the respective service. These fees are reflected as direct operating costs.

69

Revenues 

Deferred Revenues
 - The Company records deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of its performance. The decrease in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended 
December 31, 2024
 was primarily driven by 
$
39.3
 million
 of cash payments received in the current year for which the Company has not yet satisfied the performance obligations, offset by

$
39.6

million
 of revenues recognized that were included in the deferred revenue balance as of 
December 31, 2023
.

Disaggregation of Revenues -
 The following table presents the Company's revenues disaggregated by segment and region. The Company believes disaggregation by segment and region best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The disaggregation of revenues by segment and region is based on management's assessment of segment performance together with allocation of financial resources, both capital and operating support costs, on a segment and regional level. Both segments and regions benefit from synergies achieved through concentration of operations and are influenced by macro-economic, regulatory and political factors in the respective segment 
and region. The Company recognizes foreign exchange revenues from derivative instruments in its xe operations in accordance with ASC Topic 
815
 and not ASC Topic 
606
. These revenues are not significant to the Company's consolidated revenues and are included in the following tables.

Recent accounting guidance

In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 
2023
-
07
, 
Segment Reporting 
(Topic 
280
):
 Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. The amended guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. 
The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.
 The amended guidance enhances income tax disclosures primarily related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This guidance requires disclosure of specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation and further information on reconciling items meeting a quantitative threshold. In addition, the amended guidance requires disaggregating income taxes paid (net of refunds received) by federal, state, and foreign taxes. It also requires disaggregating individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and the Company will adopt the standard in the following fiscal year. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (DISE)
, which requires companies to disclose additional information about expenses in their income statements. The Company already disaggregates its most significant expense line items, and as a result, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Settlement Assets and Obligations

Settlement assets represent funds received or to be received from agents for unsettled money transfers and from merchants for unsettled prepaid transactions. The Company records corresponding settlement obligations relating to accounts payable. Settlement assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets. The settlement cash held at the Company is primarily generated from the monies remitted by consumers through Company agents and financial institutions in payment of the face value of the payment service or foreign currency purchased and the related fees charged to purchase the currency. The Company uses its cash and cash equivalents to pay the face value of the payment service product upon presentation by the recipient. Cash received by Company agents and merchants generally becomes available to the Company within 
two
 weeks after initial receipt by the business partner. Receivables from business partners represent funds collected by such business partners that are in transit to the Company.

Settlement obligations consist of accrued expenses for money transfers, content providers, and EFT customer deposits and accounts payable to agents and content providers. Money transfer accrued expenses represent amounts to be paid to 
beneficiaries
 when they request funds. Most agents typically settle with 
beneficiaries
 first then obtain reimbursement from the Company. Money order accrued expenses represent amounts not yet presented for payment. Due to the agent funding and settlement process, accrued expenses to agents represent amounts due to agents for money transfers that have not been settled with beneficiaries.

(5) Stockholders' Equity

Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the respective period. Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing diluted earnings by the weighted average shares outstanding during the respective period, after adjusting for the potential dilution of options to purchase the Company's Common Stock, assumed vesting of restricted stock and the assumed conversion of the Company's convertible debt.  

The following table provides the computation of diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding:

The calculation of diluted earnings per share excludes stock options or shares of restricted stock that are anti-dilutive to the Company's weighted average common shares outstanding for the years ended 
December 31, 2024

 and 
2022

of approximate

, respectively.  

We issued Convertible Senior Notes ("Convertible Notes") due March 2049 on March 18, 2019. Our Convertible Notes currently have a settlement feature requiring us upon conversion to settle the principal amount of the debt and any conversion value in excess of the principal value ("conversion premium"), for cash or shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our option. We have stated our intent to settle any conversion of these notes by paying cash for the principal value and issuing common stock for any conversion premium; however, after adopting ASU 
2020
-
06
, 
2.8
 million incremental shares assumed for conversion of convertible notes shall be included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation, if dilutive, regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met. Therefore, our Convertible Notes were included in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share if their inclusion was dilutive. The dilutive effect increases the more the market price exceeds the 
conversion price
 of

$
188.73

per share.

million) maturing in 
2026
 and the revolving credit facility maturing in 
2029
.

Credit Facility

On December 17, 2024, the Company amended its revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) to increase the facility from $
1.25

billion to $
1.9

billion and to extend the expiration to 
December 17, 2029
. 
The amended Credit Facility includes a multi-currency borrowing tranche totaling $
1,685
 million 
and a USD borrowing tranc
he totaling $
215
 million
. The amended Credit Facility also removes the credit spread adjustment on SOFR and SONIA borrowings. All other terms remain substantially the same as the existing Credit Facility. 
The multi-currency tranche of the revolving Credit Facility contains a sublimit of up to $
500

million
 for the issuance of letters of credit, a $
75

million

sublimit

for U.S. dollar

swingline

loans and a $
75

million sublimit for

swingline

loans in euros or British pounds sterling.

The 
multi-currency tranche of the 
Credit Facility allows for borrowings in British pounds sterling, euro and U.S. dollars. Subject to certain conditions, the Company has the option to increase the Credit Facility by up to an additional $
500

million by requesting additional commitments from existing or new lenders. 

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (other than
swing line loans) bear interest on a margin over a secured financing rate or
the base rate, as selected by the Company, which varies from 
0.875
% to 
1.375
%,
in each case based on the Company’s current credit rating.

The applicable margin for borrowings under
the credit facility, based on the Company’s current credit rating is

1.075
%. In addition, the Company pays a
facility fee on the total commitments made under the Revolving Credit Facility,
which varies from 
0.125
% to 
0.250
%. The
current facility fee is 
0.175
%.

The agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, events of default and financial covenants, including (all as defined in the Credit Facility):

(i) a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, depending on certain circumstances defined in the Credit Facility, not to exceed a range between 3.5 to 1.0 and 4.5 to 1.0; and (ii) a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0. Subject to meeting certain customary covenants (as defined in the Credit Facility), the Company is permitted to repurchase common stock and debt.
The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2024.

The weighted-average interest rate of the Company's borrowings under the Credit Facility from 
January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 was

6.39
%
.

As of 
December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, the Company had stand-by letters of credit/bank guarantees outstanding under the Credit Facility of 

$
44.5
 million 
and $
51.9
 million
, respectively. Stand-by letters of credit/bank guarantees reduce the Company's borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and are generally used to secure trade credit and performance obligations. As of 
December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, the stand-by letters of credit interest charges were
 each

1.075
% per annum
. Available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility as of 
December 31, 2024
 was
 $
1,335.1
 million.

Convertible Debt

On March 18, 2019, the Company completed the sale of $
525.0
 million of Convertible Senior Notes ("Convertible Notes"). The Convertible Notes mature in March 2049 unless redeemed or converted prior to such date and are convertible into shares of Euronet Common Stock at a conversion price of approximately $
188.73

 per share if certain conditions are met (relating to the closing price of Euronet Common Stock exceeding certain thresholds for specified periods). Holders of the Convertible Notes have the option to require the Company to purchase their notes on each of March 15, 2025, March 15, 2029, March 15, 2034, March 15, 2039, and March 15, 2044 at a repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the relevant repurchase date. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company recorded 
$
12.8
 million in debt issuance costs, which are being amortized through March 1, 2025.

The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes, at its option, 
(i) if the closing sale price of the Company's Common Stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption and (ii) on or after March 20, 2025 and prior to the maturity date, regardless of the foregoing sale price condition, in each case at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes. In addition, if a fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture, occurs prior to the maturity date, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

As of 
December 31, 2024
 the conversion threshold was not met. 
On January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 
2020
-
06
, 
"Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity" 
which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating certain accounting models when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 
815
, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in-capital.  ASU 
2020
-
06
 amended the accounting for convertible instruments with ASC Topic 
470
 Debt (See Footnote 
3
 for the accounting impact of adopting ASU 
220
-
06
). 

As noted above, the holders of the Convertible Notes
have the option to require the Company to repurchase their Convertible Notes on
March 15, 2025. Given current bond trading levels and the Company’s share
price, the Company anticipates that holders of the Convertible Notes will
exercise their repurchase option and as a result the Convertible Notes are
classified as short-term obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

December 31, 2024
.

78

Contractual interest expenses for the Convertible Notes was $
3.9
 million for each of the years ended December 31, 
2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022
. The effective interest rate was 
4.35
% for the year ended December 31, 2024. 

1.375
%

Senior Notes due 
2026

On May 22, 2019, the Company completed the sale of 
€
600.0
 million ($
669.9
 million) aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes that mature on May 2026 (the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes accrue interest at a rate of 
1.375
% per year, payable 
annually
 in arrears commencing 
May 22, 2020
, until maturity or earlier redemption. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company has outstanding 
€
600.0
 millio
n ($
621.5
 million) 
principal amount of the Senior Notes. In addition, the Company may redeem some or all of these notes on or after 
February 22, 2026
 at their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had
 $
1.7
 million
 of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Senior Notes.

Other obligations

Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have available lines of credit and overdraft credit facilities that generally provide for short-term borrowings that are used from time to time for working capital purposes. On October 9, 2024, the Company completed a facility of MYR 
140
 million and an overdraft facility of MYR 
100
 million for its Malaysian business. Each advance under this facility shall be made for a term of 
1
 month or such other period of up to 
12
 months. As of 
December 31, 2024
, $
37.4
 million was borrowed under this facility.

(13) Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk resulting from (i) the collection of funds or the settlement of money transfer transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, (ii) derivative contracts written to its customers in connection with providing cross-currency money transfer services and (iii) certain foreign currency denominated other asset and liability positions. The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily foreign currency forwards and cross-currency swaps, to minimize its exposure related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of Company policy, the derivative instruments used in these activities are economic hedges and are not designated as hedges under ASC 
815
,
 primarily due to either the relatively short duration of the contract term or the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates being reflected concurrently in earnings for both the derivative instrument and the transaction and have an offsetting effect.

Foreign currency exchange contracts - Ria Operations and Corporate

In the United States, the Company uses short-duration foreign currency forward contracts, generally with maturities up to 
14
 days, to offset the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates on the collection of money transfer funds between initiation of a transaction and its settlement. Due to the short duration of these contracts and the Company's credit profile, the Company is generally not required to post collateral with respect to these foreign currency forward contracts. Most derivative contracts 
executed with counterparties in the U.S. are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreement that includes standard netting arrangements; therefore, asset and liability positions from forward contracts and all other foreign exchange transactions with the same counterparty are net settled upon maturity. As of 
December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in the U.S. with a notional value of
 $
281.5
 million and $
393.3
 million, respectively. The foreign currency forward contracts consist primarily in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds, euros and Mexican pesos.

79

In addition, the Company uses forward contracts, typically with maturities from a few days to less than 
one
 year, to offset 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain short-term borrowings that are payable in currencies other than the U.S dollar. As of

December 31, 2024

and

2023
, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with a notional value of

$
710.4
 million
 and $
563.1

million, respectively, primarily in euros.

Foreign currency exchange contracts - xe Operations

xe, writes derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps, mostly with counterparties comprised of individuals and small-to-medium size businesses and derives a currency margin from this activity as part of its operations. xe aggregates its foreign currency exposures arising from customer contracts and hedges the resulting net currency risks by 
entering
 into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties. Foreign exchange revenues from xe's total portfolio of positions were 
$
88.8

million
, $
85.3
 million, and $
86.6
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024
, 

2023
 and 
2022
, respectively. All of the derivative contracts used in the Company's xe operations are economic hedges and are not designated as hedges under ASC 
815
.

The duration of these derivative contracts is generally less than 
one year
.

The fair value of xe's total portfolio of positions can change significantly from period to period based on, among other factors, market movements and changes in customer contract positions. xe manages counterparty credit risk (the risk that counterparties will default and not make payments according to the terms of the agreements) on an individual counterparty basis. It mitigates this risk by entering into contracts with collateral posting requirements and/or by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. xe does not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults.

The aggregate equivalent U.S. dollar notional amounts of foreign currency derivative customer contracts held by the Company in its xe operations as of 
December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
,
 was respectively
 $
0.9
 billion and $
1.1
 billion
.
 The significant majority of customer contracts are written in major currencies such as the euro, U.S. dollar, British pound, Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar.

See Note 
19
, Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements, for the determination of the fair values of derivatives. 

(14) Leases

The Company enters into operating leases for ATM sites, office spaces, retail stores and equipment. The Company's finance leases are immaterial. Right of use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease terms.

The present value of lease payments is determined using the incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

82

Most leases include an option to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease terms. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease terms. The Company also has a unilateral termination right for most of the ATM site leases.
 Leases of ATM sites with termination options exercisable within the next 12 months are excluded from the right of use lease assets and lease liability under the short-term lease exemption as the termination options are not reasonably certain not to be exercised. 
Payments for ATM site leases with termination options subject to the short-term lease exemption are expensed in the period incurred. T
he short-term lease expense for 
2024
 reasonably ref
lects the Company’s short-term lease commitments. Certain of the Company's lease agreements include variable rental payments based on revenues generated from the use of the leased location and certain leases include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Variable lease payments are recognized when the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed occurs and are excluded from the right of use assets and lease liabilities balances. The lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

 million and $

million as of 
December 31, 2024
 and 2023, respectively, are recorded within
"Other assets" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of 
December 31, 2024
 are expected to be allocated to income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of 
December 31, 2024
, and 
2023
, the Company's foreign tax loss carryforwards were $
183.3
 million and $
247.4
 million, respectively, and U.S. state tax loss carryforwards were $
81.0
 million and $
68.4
 million, respectively.

As of 
December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, the Company has U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $
57.1
 million and $
53.6
 million respectively, which are largely not expected to be utilized in future periods.

In assessing the Company's ability to realize deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances, as of 
December 31, 2024
.

As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had foreign tax net operating loss carryforwards of $

The Company has not provided additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or additional state taxes, if any, on undistributed earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries and it is not practical to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. Gross undistributed earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries aggregated approximately 
$
2,749.5
 million
 as of 
December 31, 2024
.

Based upon the current OECD rules and administrative
guidance, as well as the related legislation of those countries which has been
enacted to date, the Company does not anticipate being subject to material minimum
foreign taxes. The Company is continuing to monitor the potential impact of the
Pillar Two proposals and developments on our Consolidated Financial Statements
and related disclosures, including eligibility for any transitional safe harbor
rules.

$
36.4
 million
 and $
38.2
 million, respectively, of the unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company's provision for income taxes and effective income tax rate, if recognized. Total estimated accrued interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes was 
$
7.1
 million
 and $
10.0
 million as of 
December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, respectively. The following income tax years remain open in the Company's major jurisdictions as of

It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next 
twelve
 months as a result of the resolution of audit examinations and expirations of certain statutes of limitations and, accordingly, materially affect the Company's operating results. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the range of change due to the uncertainty of potential outcomes.

(16) Valuation and Qualifying Accounts

Trade accounts receivable and accounts receivable balances included within the settlement assets are stated net of credit losses. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant write-offs.

(17) Stock Plans

The Company has share-based compensation plans ("SCP") that allow it to grant restricted shares, or options to purchase shares, of common stock to certain current and prospective key employees, directors, and consultants of the Company. These awards gen
erally vest over periods ranging from 
three
 to 
four years
 from the date of grant. Stock options are generally exercisable during the shorter of a 
ten
-year
 term or the term of employment with the Company. With the exception of certain awards made to the Company's employees in Germany, Singapore and Malaysia, awards under the SCP are settled through the issuance of new shares under the provisions of the SCP. For Company employees in Germany, Singapore and Malaysia, certain awards are settled through the issuance of treasury shares, which also reduces the number of shares available for future issuance under the SCP. As of

December 31, 2024
, the Company has approximately 
2.8
 million in total shares remaining available for issuance under the SCP.

Share-based compensation expense was $
43.9
 million, 
$
53.7
 million, and $
44.1
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022
, respectively, and was recorded in salaries and benefits expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company recorded a tax benefit of 
$
2.0
 million,
 $
4.0
 million, and $
3.4

million during the years ended 
December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and

(19) Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements

Concentrations of credit risk

The Company's credit risk primarily relates to trade accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents. The EFT Processing Segment's customer base includes the most significant international card organizations and certain banks in its markets. The epay Segment's customer base is diverse and includes several major retailers and/or distributors in markets that they operate. The Money Transfer Segment trade accounts receivable is primarily due from independent agents that collect cash from customers on the Company's behalf and generally remit the cash within 
one
 week. The Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers' financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended, or purchases credit enhancement protection, when deemed necessary, but generally requires no collateral. See Note 
16
, Valuation and Qualifying Accounts, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disclosure.

The Company invests excess cash not required for use in operations primarily in high credit quality, short-term duration securities that the Company believes bear minimal risk. 

95

Fair value measurements

Fair value measurements used in the consolidated financial statements are based upon the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transac
tion between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between (
1
) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (
2
) an entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of 
three
 broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices 
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 
1
) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 
3
). The 
three
 levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

L
evel

1

– Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

L
evel

2

– Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level

3

– Unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and short-term debt obligations are approximate fair values due to their short maturities. The carrying values of the Company's revolving credit agreements approximate fair values because interest is based on SOFR that resets at various
 intervals of less than 
one
 year. The Company estimates the fair value of the Convertible Notes and Senior Notes using quoted prices in inactive markets for identical liabilities (Level 
2
). As of 
December 31, 2024
, the fair values of the Convertible Notes and Senior Notes were 
$
515.4
 million
 and $
604.8
 million
, respectively, with carrying values of 
$
525.0
 million
 and 
$
621.5
 million,
 respectively.

(20) Litigation and Contingencies

From time to time, the Company is a party to legal or regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company records a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Currently
, there are no legal proceedings or regulatory findings which are both probable that a liability has been incurred and can be reasonably estimated that management believes, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial condition or results of operations. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.

During July 2024, the Company received an adverse judicial decision related to withholding taxes on certain agency relationships in Italy within the Money Transfer Segment, which the Company has appealed. In January 2025, the Company received a positive judicial decision in the same court related to the same issue but corresponding to a different taxable period. The Company completed an assessment and concluded that it is reasonably possible that a liability has been incurred, but not probable.
 The principal amount of the agent-based withholding tax could be approximately $
16.5
 million for all open periods.

96

(21) Commitments

As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had
 $
69.9

million
 of stand-by letters of credit/bank guarantees issued on its behalf, of which 
$
3.0
 million
 are collateralized by cash deposits held by the respective issuing banks.

Under certain circumstances, the Company grants guarantees in support of the obligations of subsidiaries. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company granted off balance sheet guarantees for cash in various ATM networks amounting to

 $
10.3

million
 over the terms of the cash supply agreements and performance guarantees amounting to approximately 
$
39.6

million
 over the terms of the agreements with the customers.

From time to time, the Company enters into agreements with commercial counterparties that contain indemnification provisions, the terms of which may vary depending on the negotiated terms of each respective agreement. The amount of such potential obligations is generally not stated in the agreements. Euronet's liability under such indemnification provisions may be mitigated by relevant insurance coverage and may be subject to time and materiality limitations, monetary caps and other conditions and defenses. Such indemnification obligations include the following:  

 • 

In connection with contracts with financial institutions in the EFT Processing Segment, the Company is responsible for damage to ATMs and theft of ATM network cash that, generally, is not recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the balance of such cash used in the Company's ATM networks for which the Company was responsible was approximately
 $
416.3
 million.
 The Company maintains insurance policies to mitigate this exposure;

 • 

 In connection with contracts with certain customers the Company is responsible for losses suffered by those customers and other parties as a result of the breach of its computer systems, including in particular, losses arising from fraudulent transactions made using information stolen through its processing systems. The Company maintains insurance policies to mitigate this exposure; 

 • 

 In connection with the license of proprietary systems to customers, the Company provides certain warranties and infringement indemnities to the licensee, which generally warrant that such systems do not infringe on intellectual property owned by third parties and that the systems will perform in accordance with their specifications; 

 • 

 Euronet has entered into purchase and service agreements with vendors and consulting agreements with providers of consulting services, pursuant to which the Company has agreed to indemnify certain of such vendors and consultants, respectively, against third-party claims arising from the Company's use of the vendor's product or the services of the vendor or consultant; 

 • 

 In connection with acquisitions and dispositions of subsidiaries, operating units and business assets, the Company has entered into agreements containing indemnification provisions, which can be generally described as follows: (i) in connection with acquisitions of operating units or assets made by Euronet, the Company has agreed to indemnify the seller against third party claims made against the seller relating to the operating unit or asset and arising after the closing of the transaction, and (ii) in connection with dispositions made by Euronet, Euronet has agreed to indemnify the buyer against damages incurred by the buyer due to the buyer's reliance on representations and warranties relating to the subject subsidiary, operating unit or business assets in the disposition agreement if such representations or warranties were untrue when made; and 

 • 

 Euronet has entered into agreements with certain third parties, including banks that provide fiduciary and other services to Euronet or to the Company's benefit plans. Under such agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such service providers for third-party claims relating to carrying out their respective duties under such agreements.  

The Company is also required to meet minimum capitalization and cash requirements of various regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which the Company has money transfer operations. The Company has obtained surety bonds in compliance with money transfer licensing requirements of the applicable governmental authorities. 

To date, the Company is not aware of any significant claims made by the indemnified parties or third parties to guarantee agreements with the Company and, accordingly, 
no
 liabilities were recorded as of 
December 31, 2024
 or 
2023
.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

To the Stockholders of Euronet Worldwide, Inc.:
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control over financial reporting as this term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has made organizational arrangements providing appropriate divisions of responsibility and has established communication programs aimed at assuring that its policies, procedures and principles of business conduct are understood and practiced by its employees. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management of Euronet Worldwide, Inc. assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2024
. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal

Control-Integrated Framework 
(2013). 
Based on these criteria and our assessment, we have determined that, as of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2024
, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their audit report, included herein.

PLEASE NOTE: Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we have filed or incorporated by reference the agreements referenced above as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The agreements have been filed to provide investors with 
information regarding their respective terms. The agreements are not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company or its business or operations. In particular, the assertions embodied in any representations, warranties and covenants contained in the agreements may be subject to qualifications with respect to knowledge and materiality different from those applicable to investors and may be qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules not included with the exhibits. These disclosure schedules may contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the agreements. Moreover, certain representations, warranties and covenants in the agreements may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties, rather than establishing matters as facts. In addition, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may have changed after the date of the respective agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company's public disclosures. Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants in the agreements as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the Company or its business or operations on the date hereof.
