ITEM 2. PROPERTIES 
In August 2023, we entered into a lease arrangement for a to-be constructed office space for our corporate headquarters, which will contribute right of use assets and lease liabilities upon lease commencement, which is currently anticipated to occur by the first half of 2025. 
We own the Freshpet Kitchens Bethlehem ("Kitchens 1.0" and "Kitchens 2.0"). Kitchens 1.0 is approximately a 100,000 square-foot manufacturing facility, and Kitchens 2.0 is approximately a 140,000 square-foot manufacturing facility, both located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania (together, the "Freshpet Kitchens Bethlehem"). 
Additionally we own a second location in Ennis, Texas ("Freshpet Kitchens Ennis"), that will be completed in 3 phases. Phase 1 had one line commissioned during 2022 and the remaining two lines were completed during 2023, subsequent to which, the Freshpet Kitchens Ennis facility represents approximately 400,000 square-feet. Phase 2 commissioning was initiated in 2024 with the addition of two lines, with the balance of Phase 2 and Phase 3 planned for completion over the next several years. At the completion of phase 2 and 3, the Freshpet Kitchens Ennis facility will grow by approximately 400,000 square-feet.
