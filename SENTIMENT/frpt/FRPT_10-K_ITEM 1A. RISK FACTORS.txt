Overview 
Freshpet's mission is to elevate the way we feed our pets with fresh food that nourishes all. We were inspired by the rapidly growing view among pet owners that their dogs and cats are a part of their family, leading them to demand healthier pet food choices. Since Freshpet's inception in 2006, we have created a comprehensive business model to deliver wholesome pet food that pet parents can trust, and in the process, we believe we have become one of the fastest growing pet food companies in North America. Our business model is difficult for others to replicate and we see significant opportunity for future growth by leveraging the unique elements of our business, including our brand, our product know-how, our Freshpet Kitchens, our refrigerated distribution, our Freshpet Fridges and our culture.
Components of our Results of Operations
Net Sales 
Our net sales are derived from the sale of fresh pet food products to retailers, through direct sales and distributor arrangements. Our products are sold to consumers through a fast-growing network of company-owned branded refrigerators, known as Freshpet Fridges, located in our customers’ stores. We continue to roll out Freshpet Fridges at leading retailers across North America and parts of Europe and have installed Freshpet Fridges in approximately 28,141 retail stores as of December 31, 2024. Our products are sold under the Freshpet brand name with ingredients, packaging and labeling customized by class of retail. Sales are recorded net of discounts, returns and promotional allowances.
Our net sales growth is driven by the following key factors:
•
Increasing sales velocity from the average Freshpet Fridge due to increasing awareness, trial and adoption of Freshpet products and innovation. Our investments in marketing and advertising help to drive awareness and trial at each point of sale.
•
Increasing penetration of Freshpet Fridge locations in major classes of retail, including Grocery, Mass, International, Digital, Pet Specialty, and Club. The impact of new Freshpet Fridge installations on our net sales varies by retail class and depends on numerous factors including store traffic, refrigerator size, placement within the store, and proximity to other stores that carry our products.
•
Consumer trends including growing pet ownership, pet humanization and a focus on health and wellness.
•
At times we increase our sales price to offset any adverse movement in input costs.
Gross Profit
Our gross profit is net of costs of goods sold, which include the costs of product manufacturing, product ingredients, packaging materials and inbound freight, as well as depreciation and amortization and non-cash share-based compensation.
We expect to continue to mitigate any adverse movement in input costs through a combination of cost management and price increases. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of the following:
Outbound freight. 
We use a third-party logistics provider for outbound freight that ships directly to retailers as well as third-party distributors.
Marketing & advertising.
 Our marketing and advertising expenses primarily consist of national television media, digital marketing, social media and grass roots marketing to drive brand awareness. These expenses may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our marketing and advertising campaigns. Our Feed the Growth initiative focuses on growing the business through increased marketing investments.
Freshpet Fridge operating costs.
 Freshpet Fridge operating costs consist of repair costs and depreciation. The purchase and installation costs for new Freshpet Fridges are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life. All new refrigerators are covered by a manufacturer warranty for three years. We subsequently incur maintenance and freight costs for repairs and refurbishments handled by third-party service providers.
30
Table of Contents
Research & development.
 Research and development costs consist of expenses to develop and test new products. The costs are expensed as incurred.
Brokerage.
 We use third-party brokers to assist with monitoring our products at the point-of-sale as well as representing us at headquarters for various customers. These brokers visit our retail customers’ store locations to ensure items are appropriately stocked and maintained.
Share-based compensation
. The Company recognizes share-based compensation based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. The Company estimates grant date fair value of its options using the Black-Scholes Merton option-pricing model. Restricted stock units are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the dates of the grants. Share awards are amortized under the straight-line method over the requisite service period of the entire award. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
Other general & administrative costs.
 Other general and administrative costs include non-plant personnel salaries and benefits, as well as corporate general & administrative costs.
Income Taxes 
We had federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carry forwards of approximately $391.5 million as of December 31, 2024, of which, approximately $146.7 million, generated in 2017 and prior, will expire between 2028 and 2037. The NOLs generated from 2018 through 2023, of approximately $244.8 million, will have an indefinite carryforward period, but can generally only be used to offset 80% of taxable income in any particular year. We may be subject to certain limitations in our annual utilization of NOL carry forwards to off-set future taxable income pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which could result in NOLs expiring unused. At December 31, 2024, we had approximately $278.4 million of state NOLs, which expire between 2025 and 2046, and had $27.6 million of foreign NOLs in the United Kingdom which do not expire. At December 31, 2024, we had a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as the realization of such assets was not considered more likely than not.

Effective March 31, 2024, the Company is providing a more meaningful breakout of its sales, which now combines pet specialty and club, as both classes of retailers service a specific consumer through specialized offerings, which include value focused and or premium products. In contrast, grocery, mass, international and digital offer a wide variety of products.
Net sales were $975.2 million and $766.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing increases of $208.3 million and $171.6 million, or 27.2% and 28.8%, as compared to the respective prior years. The net sales increases were driven by year-over-year growth in the Grocery, Mass, International and Digital channel of $158.5 million and $138.6 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the remaining growth in the Pet Specialty and Club channel. This growth was primarily driven by year-over-year volume gains of 26.1% and 20.0% in 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Gross Profit
Gross profit was $396.0 million, or 40.6% as a percentage of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $250.9 million, or 32.7% as a percentage of net sales, for the prior year. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower input costs, reduced quality costs and improved leverage on plant expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Adjusted Gross Profit was $453.5 million, or 46.5% as a percentage of net sales, compared to $306.6 million, or 40.0% as a percentage of net sales, in the prior year. See "—Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") were $358.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $281.3 million for the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A remained consistent at 36.7% for both years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. SG&A as a percentage of net sales remained consistent as the decreases due to reduced logistics as a percentage of net sales and the absence of non-recurring charges incurred in the prior year were fully offset by increased media as a percentage of net sales, higher share-based compensation and increased variable compensation accrual.
Adjusted SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $291.6 million, or 29.9% as a percentage of net sales, compared to $240.1 million, or 31.3% as a percentage of net sales, for the prior year. See "—Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Income (Loss) from Operations
As a result of the factors discussed above, income from operations increased by $68.4 million to income from operations of $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to a loss from operations of $30.4 million for the prior year.

Table of Contents
Interest and Other Income, net
The Company recorded interest and other income, net of $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as a result of interest income generated from cash and cash equivalents as compared to $13.0 million for the prior year, which also included interest income generated from short-term investments.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $1.8 million to interest expense of $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to interest expense of $14.1 million for the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the termination of our Credit Agreement in the prior year resulting in the write-off of unamortized fees of $2.5 million, which were recorded to interest expense, and the non-recurring $0.3 million of interest expense incurred on this facility prior to termination, partially offset by a $0.2 million increase (net of capitalized interest) as a result of interest incurred on our Convertible Notes compared to interest incurred in the prior year and a $1.0 million increase related to the interest on our finance lease liability.
Gain on Equity Investment
The $9.9 million gain on equity investment for the year ended December 31, 2024, resulted from the change in fair value of the Company's equity interest in a privately held company. 
Net Income (Loss)
Net income increased $80.5 million to net income of $46.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to a net loss of $33.6 million in the prior year, primarily due to contribution from higher sales, improved gross margin, reduced logistics costs as a percentage of net sales, and gain on equity investment, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA was $161.8 million, or 16.6% as a percentage of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $66.6 million, or 8.7% as a percentage of net sales, in the prior year. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was a result of increased Adjusted Gross Profit partially offset by higher Adjusted SG&A expenses. See "—Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Freshpet uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in its financial communications. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the U.S. GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to, the U.S. GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.

•

•

•

Such financial measures are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as Gross Profit before depreciation expense, non-cash share-based compensation, and loss on disposal of manufacturing equipment. We define Adjusted SG&A as SG&A expenses before depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash share-based compensation, implementation and other costs associated with the implementation of an ERP system, fees related to the Capped Call Transactions associated with the sale of our Convertible Notes in 2023, loss on disposal of equipment, advisory fees related to shareholder activism defense engagement, and organizational changes. EBITDA represents net income (loss) plus interest expense net of interest income, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA less gain on equity investment, plus loss on equity method investment, non-cash share-based compensation expense, implementation and other costs associated with the implementation of an ERP system, loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment, fees related to the Capped Call Transactions, advisory fees related to activism engagement, and organizational changes.

We believe that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional metrics to evaluate our operations and, when considered with both our U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliation to the closest comparable U.S. GAAP measures, provides a more complete understanding of our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We use the non-GAAP financial measures, together with U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, gross profit margins and cash flow from operations, to assess our historical and prospective operating performance, to provide meaningful comparisons of operating performance across periods, to enhance our understanding of our operating performance, and to compare our performance to that of our peers and competitors.
Adjusted EBITDA is also an important component of internal budgeting and setting management compensation.
The non-GAAP financial measures are presented here because we believe they are useful to investors in assessing the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash items, and other items as detailed herein. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations or any other measure of financial performance calculated and prescribed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner as we do.
Our presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the expenses that are excluded from that term or by unusual or non-recurring items. We recognize that the non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical financial measures. For example, the non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect:
•
our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures;
•
the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest expense or principal payments, associated with indebtedness;
•
depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash charges, although the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future, nor any cash requirements for such replacements; and
•
changes in our cash requirements for our working capital needs.
Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA excludes (i) non-cash share-based compensation expense, which is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, and (ii) certain costs essential to our sales growth and strategy. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Other companies in our industry may calculate the non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
To meet our capital needs, we issued approximately $402.5 million in convertible notes in March 2023 (the "Convertible Notes"), used $66.2 million of the proceeds to enter into capped call transactions, and used $11.0 million of the proceeds on debt issuance related costs. Further, on March 13, 2023, in connection with the proposed offering of the Convertible Notes, the Company notified City National Bank of Freshpet's intent to terminate the Credit Agreement, and such termination became effective as of March 15, 2023 (the "Termination Date"). The Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of the Termination Date.
We expect to make future capital expenditures in connection with the completion of our planned development of Freshpet Kitchens Ennis Phase 2 and 3. During fiscal year 2024, we spent approximately $187.1 million of capital to meet our capacity needs as well as recurring capital expenditures. In fiscal year 2025, we expect to spend approximately $250.0 million. 
We expect to rely on our current and future cash flow from operations, may issue additional debt, and/or raise capital through our access to capital markets, if appropriate. Our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to various factors, including general economic and market conditions, our operating performance, the market's perception of our growth potential, lender sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with other contractual restrictions.
Our ability to make future minimum interest payments on the Convertible Notes, to refinance any indebtedness and to fund any necessary expenditures for our growth will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If our business does not achieve the levels of profitability or generate the amount of cash that we anticipate or if we expand faster than anticipated, we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing to operate and expand our business. Future third-party financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all. 
Our primary cash needs, in addition to our plant expansions, are for purchasing ingredients, operating expenses, marketing expenses and capital expenditures to procure Freshpet Fridges. We believe that cash and cash equivalents, expected cash flow from operations, amounts previously raised through the issuance of the Convertible Notes and our ability to access the capital markets, if appropriate, are adequate to fund our debt service requirements, operating and finance lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital obligations for the foreseeable future. We believe our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy and additional expenses we expect to incur for at least the next twelve months. However, our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow from operations and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. Additionally, our cash flow generation ability is subject to general economic factors at the international, national and regional levels, including but not limited to increased interest rates and inflation, tariffs, trade wars, recession, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control, including government or regulatory shutdowns or defunding, or disruptions with or increased costs imposed by our key suppliers or others within our supply chain. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs. Expanding certain of our Freshpet Kitchens primarily comprises our material future cash requirement. However, our capital requirements, including our cash requirements, may vary materially from those currently planned if, for example, our revenues do not reach expected levels, or we have to incur unforeseen capital expenditures and make investments to maintain our competitive position. If this is the case, we may seek alternative financing, such as issuing additional debt or equity securities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on favorable terms, if at all. Moreover, if we issue new debt securities, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. If we issue additional equity or if the Convertible Notes are converted to common shares, existing stockholders may experience dilution, and such new securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of additional financing unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth or otherwise require us to forego growth opportunities and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Working capital consists of current assets net of current liabilities. Working capital remained consistent at $338.1 million at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. Working capital remained consistent as the increases consisting of an increase of $17.6 million in inventories, net, an increase of $11.7 million in accounts receivable, and an increase of $8.4 million in prepaid expenses were fully offset by a decrease of $28.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $6.4 million in accrued expenses due to timing, and an increase of $3.1 million in accounts payable as a result of timing. 

We normally carry three to five weeks of finished goods inventory and less than 30 days of accounts receivable.
As of December 31, 2024, our capital resources consisted primarily of $268.6 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand.
As of December 31, 2023, our capital resources consisted primarily of $296.9 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. 
We expect to fund our ongoing operations and obligations with cash and cash equivalents, and cash flow from operations.

38
Table of Contents
2024
Net cash provided by operating activities of $154.3 million in 2024 was primarily attributed to:

Indebtedness 
For a discussion of our material indebtedness, see Note 6 and 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the revenue and expenses incurred during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and share-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates and policies are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
While our significant accounting estimates and policies are described in the notes to our financial statements appearing in this report, we believe that the following critical accounting estimates and policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period.
We believe that the accounting estimates policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies related to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results, as determined at a later date, could differ from those estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimate and the actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.
The following critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
Revenue Recognition and Incentives
—Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with the customer are satisfied, which occurs once control is transferred upon delivery to the customer. 
40
Table of Contents
Revenue is reported net of applicable trade incentives and allowances. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as receivables and require payment on a short-term basis and, therefore, we do not have any significant financing components.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods, including estimates of trade incentives the Company offers to its customers and their consumers. Trade incentives consist primarily of customer pricing allowances and merchandising funds, and consumer coupons offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Estimates of trade promotion expense and coupon redemption costs are based upon programs offered, timing of those offers, estimated redemption/usage rates from historical performance, management’s experience and current economic trends.
While our revenue recognition does not involve significant judgment, it represents a significant accounting policy.
Share-based Compensation
—The Company recognizes share-based compensation based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. The Company estimates grant date fair value of its options using the Black-Scholes Merton option-pricing model. Restricted stock units are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the dates of the grants. Share awards are amortized under the straight-line method over the requisite service period of the entire award. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
We have outstanding share-based awards that have performance-based vesting conditions in addition to time-based vesting. Awards with performance-based vesting conditions require the achievement of certain financial criteria as a condition to the vesting. For certain performance-based awards, the quantity of awards received can range based on the level of performance achieved. The performance-based awards with financial criteria either have a Net Sales and/or Adjusted EBITDA target from FY 2023 through FY 2027. We recognize the estimated fair value of performance-based awards as share-based compensation expense over the performance period based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved. At each reporting period, we reassess the probability of achieving the performance criteria and the performance period required to meet those targets. Determining whether the performance criteria will be achieved involves judgment, and the share-based compensation expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance criteria. Revisions are reflected in the period in which the probability assessment is changed. If performance goals are not met, no share-based compensation expense is recognized for the cancelled shares, and, to the extent share-based compensation expense was previously recognized for those cancelled shares, such share-based compensation expense is reversed.

Table of Contents
ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS
Interest Rate Risk
During periods of rising interest rates, our cost of borrowing could increase, the fair value of our investments could be affected, and it could constrain the purchasing power of our customers.
Commodity Price and Inflation Risk 
We purchase certain products and services that are affected by commodity prices, including, but not limited to agricultural products. These products are subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions, disease, government programs and policies, labor availability and availability of similar or competitive products, and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control. In many cases, we believe we will be able to address material commodity cost increases by either increasing prices or reducing operating expenses. However, increases in commodity prices, without adjustments to pricing or reduction to operating expenses, could increase our operating costs as a percentage of our net sales.
Inflation
Our profitability is dependent, among other things, on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and other raw materials, labor, energy and other supplies and services. Substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our customers. 
While generally we have been able to offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources through price increases, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale, our price increases are not always implemented immediately, which can cause us to temporarily absorb increased cost. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to effectively implement such offsets in the future. From time to time, competitive conditions could limit our pricing flexibility. In addition, macroeconomic conditions could make additional price increases imprudent. There can be no assurance that all future cost increases can be offset by increased prices or that increased prices will be fully absorbed without any resulting changes in product purchasing patterns.
Foreign Exchange Rates
Fluctuations in the currencies of countries where the Company operates outside the U.S. may impact our financial results. The Company is exposed to movements in the British pound sterling, Euro and Canadian Dollar. The Statements of Financial Position of non-U.S. business units are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. The percentage of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 recognized in Europe was less than 1%.
The Company may, from time to time, enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the Company's exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Historically, the foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as hedges and, accordingly, any changes in their fair value are recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in Interest and Other Income, net, and carried at their fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with gains reported in prepaid expenses and other current assets and losses reported in accrued expenses. As of December 31, 2024, there were no forward contracts outstanding.

Freshpet, Inc.:
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Freshpet, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control 
–
 Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in 
Internal Control 
–
 Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
44
Table of Contents
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Assessment of probability of achieving the vesting performance criteria of share-based awards
As discussed in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes share-based compensation based on the value of the number of share-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest during the period. Share-based awards with performance-based vesting conditions require the achievement of certain financial criteria as a condition to vesting. For certain performance-based awards, the quantity of awards with the financial criteria have 1) an annual revenue target or 2) adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization target within fiscal years 2023 through 2027. At each reporting period, the Company reassesses the probability of achieving the performance criteria required to meet those vesting targets. When achievement of the vesting criteria is considered probable, compensation cost is recognized. As of December 31, 2024, there were unrecognized compensation costs of approximately $12.79 million and $1.55 million related to performance-based restricted stock units and stock options, respectively, for which the achievement of the vesting criteria is considered probable.
We identified the assessment of probability of achieving the vesting performance criteria of share-based awards as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the assumptions related to the Company’s determination of the probability that the performance criteria will be achieved for the share-based awards involved subjective auditor judgment. In particular, judgment was required to assess the probability of meeting the Company’s future performance targets, including forecasted revenue.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s share-based compensation process, including a control related to the Company’s assessment of assumptions that were used in the determination that a performance criterion was probable of achievement. To assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast revenue, we compared the Company’s historical revenue forecasts to actual results. We compared forecasted revenue to those in communications to the Board of Directors, press releases and analyst reports.

FRESHPET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except per share data)
Note 1 – 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: 
Nature of the Business 
– 
Freshpet, Inc. (hereafter referred to as “Freshpet”, the “Company”, "we," "us" or "our"), a Delaware corporation, manufactures and markets natural fresh meals and treats for dogs and cats. The Company’s products are distributed throughout the United States, Canada and other international markets, into major retail classes including Grocery, Mass, International, Digital, Pet Specialty, and Club.
Basis of Presentation 
–

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). All amounts included in the consolidated financial statements have been rounded except where otherwise stated. As figures are rounded, numbers presented throughout this document may not add up precisely to the totals we provide and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.
Principles of Consolidation
 – 
The financial statements include the accounts of the Company as well as the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Estimates and Uncertainties
 – 
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, trade incentives, share-based compensation, and useful lives for long-lived assets. Actual results, as determined at a later date, could differ from those estimates.
Segments
 – 
The Company has 
one
 operating and reportable segment, as the Company's chief operating decision maker, who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.
The accounting policies of the segment are the same as those described herein, Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Investment in Unconsolidated Company
 – 
The Company utilizes the equity method to account for investments when the Company possesses the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when an investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may

be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. 
In applying the equity method, the Company records the investment at cost and subsequently increases or decreases the carrying amount of the investment by its proportionate share of the net income or loss. The Company has elected to record its share of equity in income (losses) of equity method investment on a one-quarter lag based on the most recently available financial statements. 
Through 2022, we invested a total of $
31,200
 in a privately held company that operates in our industry, with no additional investments thereafter. The Company concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact economic performance. Prior to March 30, 2023,

the Company accounted for the investment under the equity method of accounting based on its ability to exercise significant influence, based on its representation on and the makeup of the investee's Board of Directors. 
51
Table of Contents

FRESHPET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except per share data)
On

March 30, 2023,

the Company no longer had representation on the investee's Board of Directors, and therefore determined that significant influence had been lost as of that date. As such, as of March 30, 2023,

the Company stopped accounting for the investment as an equity method investment and began to account for the investment under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 321 ("ASC 321"), Investments - Equity Securities. As of December 31, 2024,

the Company's ability to exercise significant influence continues to be restricted as it no longer has, or the ability to obtain, board representation and it has no means of participation in any decision making processes as the privately held investee's Board of Directors is closely held. 
Because the investee is a privately held company, there is not a means to obtain a readily determinable fair value of the entity. The Company follows ASC 321 using the measurement alternative to measure investments in investees that do not have readily determinable fair value and over which the Company does not have significant influence. Under ASC 321, the initial carrying value of the investment is equal to the previous carrying amount of the investment under the equity method. The carrying amount of the investment is subsequently adjusted for any impairment or adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, if any. Dividends and distributions, if any, from the investee would be recognized in the period in which they are received and recorded in other income on the consolidated statement of operations.
The Company performs a qualitative assessment of whether the investment is impaired at each reporting date. If a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, the Company estimates the investment's fair value in accordance with the principles of ASC Topic 820 ("ASC 820"), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. If the fair value is less than the investment's carrying value, the entity recognizes an impairment loss in earnings equal to the difference between the carrying value and fair value.
 On March 26, 2024, the investee completed an equity funding, which we concluded represented an orderly transaction for an identical equity security with no differences in rights and obligations. As a result, pursuant to the ASC 321 measurement alternative, we adjusted the carrying amount of our equity investment from $
23,528
 as of December 31, 2023 to $
33,446
 as of March 31, 2024, recognizing a gain of $
9,918
 in earnings for the year ended 2024, based on the observable transactional price of the identical equity security issued by the investee.
March 2023 Issuance of $
402.5
 million of 
3.00
% Convertible Senior Notes (the "Convertible Notes") 
– 
In conjunction with the issuance of the $
402.5
 million Convertible Notes in March 2023,

the Company evaluated the debt instrument and its embedded features to determine if the contract or the embedded components of the contract qualified as a derivative that would be required to be separately accounted for in accordance with the relevant accounting literature. 
The Company accounts for the Convertible Notes as a single liability measured at amortized cost. The Company uses the effective interest rate method to amortize the debt issuance costs to interest expense over the respective term of the Convertible Notes.
Inventories
 – 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the first-in, first-out method. When necessary, the Company provides allowances to adjust the carrying value of its inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value, including any costs to sell or dispose and consideration for obsolescence, excessive inventory levels, product deterioration and other factors in evaluating net realizable value.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
 – 
Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost. The Company recognizes depreciation pursuant to the straight-line method based upon estimated useful lives of 
7
 years for furniture and office equipment, 
9
 years for refrigeration equipment, 
5
 to 
10
 years for machinery and equipment, and 
15
 to 
39
 years for building and improvements. Capitalized cost includes the costs incurred to bring the property, plant, and equipment to the condition and location necessary for its intended use, which includes any necessary delivery, electrical, and installation cost for equipment. Maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of the assets over 
two years
 are charged to expense as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives on the straight-line method.
52
Table of Contents

FRESHPET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except per share data)
Long-Lived Assets
 – 
The Company evaluates all long-lived assets for impairment. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset 

may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to their fair value less estimated costs to sell. Estimating future net cash flows and determining fair value of assets requires significant estimates and assumptions by management. If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carry amount to fair value and is charged to expense in the period of impairment.
Leases
 – 
The Company is a lessee in noncancelable (1) operating leases, and (2) finance leases, which it accounts for in accordance with ASC Topic 842
,

Leases
.
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The Company recognizes a right of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. For both operating and finance leases, the right of use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received; and the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date.
The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate; therefore, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future payments for those leases. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms in a similar economic environment.
Right of use assets for the operating and finance leases are periodically reviewed for impairment losses. The Company uses the long-lived assets impairment guidance in ASC Subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment - Overall, to determine whether a right of use asset is impaired, and if so, the amount of the impairment loss to recognize. No such loss was recognized as of December 31, 2024.
The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that require a reassessment of its leases. When a reassessment results in the remeasurement of a lease liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the corresponding right of use asset.
The Company has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components when determining the right of use asset and lease liability. The Company has also elected not to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The Company recognizes the lease payments associated with its short-term leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Income Taxes 
– 
The Company provides for deferred income taxes for temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting, principally net operating loss carryforwards, depreciation, and share-based compensation. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effects for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
A valuation allowance is appropriate when management believes it is more likely than not (a probability level of more than 50%), the deferred tax asset will not be realized. This evaluation utilizes the framework contained in ASC Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, pursuant to which management analyzed all positive and negative evidence available at the balance sheet date to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company determined that a full valuation of its net deferred tax assets and liabilities is appropriate. The Company will continue to monitor the realizability of its net deferred tax assets in the future and determine the necessity or changes to such valuation allowance based on future positive and negative evidence.
The taxable income position as of December 31, 2024 was fully offset by our federal NOL carry forwards and corresponding change in valuation allowance, resulting in no federal income tax expense in the current period.

FRESHPET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except per share data)
Share-based Compensation
 – 
The Company recognizes share-based compensation based on the value of the portion of share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. The Company estimates grant date fair value of its options using the Black-Scholes Merton option-pricing model. Restricted stock units are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the dates of the grants. Share awards are amortized under the straight-line method over the requisite service period of the entire award. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
Cash Equivalents
 – 
The Company holds treasury bills with original maturities when purchased of less than three months, within cash and cash equivalents, carried at amortized cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Treasury bills have been classified as held-to-maturity as we have the ability and intent to hold them to maturity.
 As of December 31, 2024,

the Company had $
109,608
 of treasury bills within cash equivalents, which included $
300
 of amortized discount. As of December 31, 2023,

the Company had $
134,570
 of treasury bills within cash equivalents, which included $
692
 of amortized discount. 
Short-Term Investments
 – 
The Company, from time to time, holds treasury bills with original maturities when purchased of greater than three months, within short-term investments, carried at amortized cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Treasury bills have been classified as held-to-maturity as we have the ability and intent to hold them to maturity.
 As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 
no
 short-term investments.
Trade Accounts Receivable
 – 
The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company's assessment of the collectability of customer accounts. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may

affect a customer's ability to pay.
Implementation Costs of Cloud Computing Arrangement
 – 
As of December 31, 2024

and 2023, the Company's deferred implementation costs of our ERP system associated with our cloud computing arrangement, which are reflected within prepaid and other assets, were $
8,965
 and $
9,895
, respectively. The cost will be recognized over the term of the agreement, which began in the first quarter of 2022.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 – 
ASC 820 guidance specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
•
Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as exchange-traded instruments and listed equities.
•
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (e.g., quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active). Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.
•
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.
Our financial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the fair values of which approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company holds certain financial assets within cash and cash equivalents in the form of held-to-maturity treasury bills as we have the ability and intent to hold them to maturity, as such, they are not fair valued each reporting period but instead measured at amortized cost. The fair value of these assets is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities within less active markets, which the Company determined to be Level 2 inputs. As of

December 31, 2024,

the fair value of these treasury bills approximates their carrying value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

FRESHPET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except per share data)
Certain financial and non-financial assets, including operating lease right-of-use assets and property, plant, and equipment are reported at their carrying values and are not subject to recurring fair value measurements. We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For the investment in equity securities, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure this investment at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes, if any, in orderly transactions for an identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, for which the change in fair value would be included in net income.
Refer to Note 7 - Convertible Senior Notes for the fair value of our Convertible Senior Notes. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company maintained Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities.
Debt Issuance Cost 
– 
The Company's policy is to record debt issuance costs as a direct deduction to the related debt liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and to amortize these debt issuance costs to interest expense over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method.

Revenue Recognition and Incentives 
– 
Revenues primarily consist of the sale of fresh pet food products to retailers, through direct sales and distributor arrangements. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with the customer are satisfied, which occurs once control is transferred upon delivery to the customer.
Revenue is reported net of applicable trade incentives and allowances. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as receivables and require payment on a short-term basis and, therefore, we do not have any significant financing components.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods, including estimates of trade incentives the Company offers to its customers and their consumers. Trade incentives consists primarily of customer pricing allowances and merchandising funds, and consumer coupons offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Estimates of trade promotion expense and coupon redemption costs are based upon programs offered, timing of those offers, estimated redemption/usage rates from historical performance, management’s experience and current economic trends.
Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue.
There were 
no
 contract assets as of December 31, 2024

and 2023.

the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued 
ASU 2023
-
07,

Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This guidance is effective for the Company for the current annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024

and subsequent interim periods and the Company has adopted the guidance as of the effective date.
Refer to Note 16 - Segment Information for required disclosures.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued 
ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, which requires improved disclosures related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This ASU requires companies to reconcile the income tax expense attributable to continuing operations to the statutory federal income tax rate applied to pre-tax income from continuing operations. Additionally, this ASU requires companies to disclose the total amount of income taxes paid during the period. This guidance will be effective for the Company for the annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and its effect on its future consolidated financial statements.
In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules to require disclosures about certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. As adopted, the Final Climate Rules mandate disclosure of, among other things, material climate-related risks, how the board of directors and management oversee and manage such risks, and the actual and potential material impacts of such risks on us. The rules also require disclosure about material climate-related targets and goals, Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events and other natural conditions. In April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the Final Climate Rules pending resolution of legal challenges. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new rules and continue to monitor the status of the related legal challenges.
In November 2024, the FASB issued 
ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
, which requires disclosures related to the specific types of expenses included within the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures about selling expenses. This guidance will be effective for the Company for the annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2027 and subsequent interim periods, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is required to be applied on a retrospective basis for all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and its effect on its future consolidated financial statements.

In assessing the realizability of the net deferred tax assets, the Company considers all relevant positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The realization of the gross deferred tax assets is dependent on several factors, including the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the Company’s deferred income tax assets will not be realized. With the exception of 2024, the Company has cumulative taxable losses from inception. As such, there is a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:

At December 31, 2024, the Company had federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $
391.5
 million, of which $
146.7
 million, generated in 2017 and prior, will expire between 2028 and 2037. The NOL generated from 2018 through 2023, of approximately $
244.8
 million, will have an indefinite carryforward period but can generally only be used to offset 80% of taxable income in any particular year. The Company may

be subject to the net operating loss utilization provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The effect of an ownership change would be the imposition of an annual limitation on the use of NOL carry forwards attributable to periods before the change. The amount of the annual limitation depends upon the value of the Company immediately before the change, changes to the Company’s capital during a specified period prior to the change, and the federal published interest rate. We have completed several analyses under Section 382 of the Code in the past which concluded that certain annual limitations exist. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
278.4
 million of state NOLs which expire between 2025 and 2046, and had $
27.6
 million of foreign NOLs in the United Kingdom which do not expire. 
Entities are also required to evaluate, measure, recognize and disclose any uncertain income tax provisions taken on their income tax returns. The Company has analyzed its tax positions and has concluded that as of December 31, 2024,

there were no uncertain positions. The Company has incurred U.S. federal and state net operating losses since its inception in 2005, with the exception of 2024, and remains in a cumulative loss position. As such, tax years subject to potential tax examination could apply from that date because the utilization of net operating losses from prior years opens the relevant year to audit by the IRS and/or state taxing authorities. Interest and penalties, if any, as they relate to income taxes assessed, are included in the income tax provision. The Company did 
not
 have any unrecognized tax benefits and has 
not
 accrued any interest or penalties through 2024, 2023 and 2022.
The Company considered the impact of the disallowance of certain compensation tax deductions in excess of $1.0 million under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m); however, to the extent an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is required the impact will be offset by a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance.

Debt:
On February 19, 2021
, 
the Company entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement ("Credit Agreement"), which provided for a $
350,000
 senior secured credit facility (as amended the "Credit Facility"), encompassing a $
300,000
 delayed draw term loan facility (the "Delayed Draw Facility") and a $
50,000
 revolving loan facility (the "Revolving Loan Facility"). 
On March 15, 2023, the Company terminated the Credit Agreement in connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes (as defined below) and it had 
no
 borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of such date. Interest expense and fees totaled $
2,785
 and $
5,208
 in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest expense in 2023 included $
2,478
 of debt issuance costs written off in conjunction with the termination of the Credit Facility in March 2023. There was $
0
 of accrued interest on the credit facilities as of December 31, 2023.
Note 7 – 
Convertible Senior Notes:
In March 2023,

we issued $
402,500
 aggregate principal amount of 
3.0
% convertible senior notes due 2028 (the "Convertible Notes"). The Convertible Notes were issued in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes were approximately $
391,492
 after deducting offering and issuance costs related to the Convertible Notes and before the 2023 Capped Call transactions, as described below. 
The Convertible Notes are our senior, unsecured obligations and accrue interest at a rate of 
3.0
% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1

and October 1

of each year, beginning on October 1, 2023.

The Convertible Notes will mature on April 1, 2028

unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased by us. Before January 3, 2028,

noteholders will have the right to convert their Convertible Notes only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ended on June 30, 2023
 (
and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock, par value $
0.001
 per share (the "common stock"), for each of at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the 
five
 consecutive business day period immediately after any 
10
 consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes, as determined following a request by a holder or holders of the Convertible Notes in the manner described in indenture pursuant to which the Convertible Notes were issued and are governed (the “Indenture”), for each trading day of the measurement period, was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) if we call any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption, but only with respect to the convertible notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events (e.g., a fundamental change or the making of certain distributions). On or after January 3, 2028,

until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, a holder may

convert its Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.

(in thousands, except per share data)
As of March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024 noteholders had the right to early convert under the 
130
% early conversion feature, with such conversion right exercisable only during the respective subsequent quarter. No early conversions occurred as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, noteholders again have the right to early convert under the 
130
% early conversion feature, with such conversion right exercisable only during the first quarter of 2025. As of the date of this filing, no early conversions have occurred during the first quarter of 2025.
We will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is 14.3516 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $
69.68
 per share of common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), which shall include among other things the Company's delivery of a notice of redemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event or redemption, as the case may

be.
We

may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to April 3, 2026.

We

may

redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes, at our option, on or after April 3, 2026

and on or before the 
40
th
 scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for each of at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 
30
 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we send the notice of redemption, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. However, we may not redeem less than all of the outstanding Convertible Notes unless at least $
100
 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes are outstanding and not called for redemption as of the time we send the related redemption notice.
Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders may

require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
The effective interest rate for the Convertible Notes is 
3.59
%. Transaction costs of $
11,008
 attributable to the issuance of the Convertible Notes were recorded as a direct deduction from the related debt liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method. 
The Company measures the fair value of its Convertible Notes for disclosure purposes. The fair value is based on observable market prices for this debt, which is traded in less active markets and is therefore classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement. 
The following table discloses the carrying value and fair value of the Company's Convertible Notes as of

4,165
 and $

 of interest expense was capitalized to construction in progress in 2024 and 2023, respectively, as the proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes are being used to fund construction on the Company's manufacturing facility expansion in Ennis, Texas. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
3,687
 and $
136
 of capitalized interest, respectively, was reclassified from construction in progress to assets placed in service.
Note 8 – 
Purchase of Capped Call Options:
In connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes issued in March 2023,

we used $
66,211
 of the net proceeds from the Convertible Notes to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions (collectively, the "Capped Call Transactions") with certain financial institutions. 
The Capped Call Transactions are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes upon conversion of the Convertible Notes in the event that the market price per share of our common stock is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. 
The Capped Call Transactions have an initial cap price of approximately $
120.23
 per share, which represents a premium of 
120
% over the last reported sale price of our common stock of $
54.65
 per share on March 15, 2023,

and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. Collectively, the Capped Call Transactions cover, initially, the number of shares of our common stock underlying the Convertible Notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes.
The Capped Call Transactions are accounted for as freestanding derivatives and recorded at the initial fair value in additional paid-in-capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with no recorded subsequent change to fair value as long as they meet the criteria for equity classification. As of December 31, 2024,

the instrument continued to qualify for equity classification.
Note 9 – 
Leases:
We have various noncancelable operating lease agreements for office and warehouse space with original remaining lease terms of 
two years
 to 
nine years
, some of which include an option to extend the lease term for up to 
four years
. Because the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise the renewal options on these lease arrangements, the options are not considered in determining the lease term and associated potential option payments are excluded from lease payments. The Company’s leases generally do not include termination options for either party to the lease or restrictive financial or other covenants.
During the third quarter of 2023,

we also entered into a finance lease agreement for manufacturing equipment with an initial term of 
ten years
, which includes an option to extend the lease term for up to 
ten years
, which the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise. The agreement did not include termination options for either party to the lease or restrictive financial or other covenants. In connection with the manufacturing equipment lease, which is a new asset class, we elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components to determine the right of use asset and lease liability.

Legal Obligations:
We are currently involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of our business. None of these claims or proceedings, most of which are covered by insurance, are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in amounts owing under successful claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
On April 8, 2022,

Phillips Feed Service, Inc., d/b/a Phillips Feed and Pet Supply ("Phillips") filed a complaint against the Company in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Allentown Division) for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the termination of the Company's distribution arrangement with Phillips, a former distributor of Freshpet products. Phillips asserts a claim for breach of contract and seeks monetary damages in excess of $
8,300
 based on a claimed "termination payment" under a 2018 "Letter Of Intent" and additional damages based on a claim for improper notice of termination. Phillips also claims a right of setoff with respect to monies owed by Phillips to the Company.
On July 5, 2022,

the Company answered the complaint disputing the claimed damages, assertions of breach of contract, and the right of offset. In addition, the Company counterclaimed breach of contract for amounts owed to Freshpet earned while Phillips served as an authorized distributor of Freshpet product.
As of December 31, 2022,

due to the claims and counterclaims between the parties, the Company reclassified the amounts due from Phillips of $
8,971
 to other noncurrent assets.
Discovery in this action has closed. The parties are currently waiting for a new trial date and a ruling on Phillips Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ("MSJ") following the reassignment of the case to a new judge on October 2, 2024. A joint status report was submitted to the new Judge on October 25, 2024 and a hearing on the MSJ and the Company's Response in Opposition was held December 4, 2024.
Based on information currently available and advice of counsel, we do not believe that the outcome of this matter is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, in the event of unexpected further developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of this matter, if unfavorable, may

be materially adverse to our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Legal costs such as outside counsel fees and expenses are charged to selling, general and administrative expenses in the period incurred.

Warrants 
(in thousands, except share data)
: 
In connection with an agreement we entered into with operators of Freshpet Kitchens South during the third quarter of 2022 in exchange for services, we issued our partner warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 
194,000
 shares of voting common stock of the Company at a purchase price of $
0.01
 per share. The Company determined these warrants are accounted for under ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation. The warrants were recorded as a prepaid expense as the warrants were exercisable at the grant date. The prepaid expense was amortized within Cost of Goods Sold as services are provided by the supplier. As of December 31, 2024, the warrants were fully amortized. As of December 31, 2023,

there were $
2,027
 of warrants in prepaid expense.
During 2022
,

194,000
 warrants were both issued and exercised, respectively. The grant date fair value of warrants granted during 2022 was $
50.32
 per share.
Total amortization associated with partner warrants during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $

Equity Incentive Plans and Equity 
(in thousands, except share data)
: 
Total compensation cost for share-based payments recognized in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $
49,779

 and $
23,505
, respectively, of which $

, respectively, was recorded to cost of goods sold with the remainder recorded to selling, general and administrative expense. The share-based compensation cost includes an adjustment related to the reassessment of the probability of achieving performance conditions related to certain outstanding share-based awards. 
Omnibus Incentive Plans
—In October 2024, the Company's stockholders approved the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2024 Plan”) under which 
1,450,000
 shares of common stock may be issued or used for reference purposes as awards granted under the 2024 Plan, for grants on or after October 1, 2024. Concurrently with the adoption of the 2024 Plan, the issuance of new awards under the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") was frozen. Awards issued pursuant to the plans may

be in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, as well as other stock-based and cash-based awards. As of December 31, 2024, the awards granted were either time-based (cliff vest over 
three years
), performance-based (vest when performance targets are met, as defined in the stock option grant agreement), or restricted stock units (employee RSUs cliff vest over 
three years
 and non-employee director RSUs cliff vest over 
one year
). 
At December 31, 2024, there were 
1,324,759
 shares of common stock available to be issued or used for reference purposes under the 2024 Plan.
NASDAQ Marketplace Rules Inducement Award
—During 2016, 
500,000
 service period stock options and 
500,000
 performance-based stock options were granted to the Company’s CEO as an inducement under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules.
During 2022, as an inducement under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, and therefore outside of any Plan, 
40,120
 service period stock options and 
22,381
 restricted stock units were granted to the Company's CFO.
During 2024, as an inducement under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, and therefore outside of any Plan, 
17,150
 restricted stock units were granted to the Company’s COO.
Under the terms of the applicable agreement, each grant is governed as if issued under the 2014 Omnibus Plan. The awards granted are time-based (cliff vest over 
four years
 or 
three years
) and performance-based (vest when performance targets are met, as defined in the stock option grant agreement).

Note 13 – 
Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders:
Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities. For the purpose of determining diluted earnings per common share, the treasury stock method is used for stock options, warrants, and RSUs, and the if-converted method is used for convertible instruments such as convertible debt as prescribed in ASC Topic 260 ("ASC 260"). In conjunction with the issuance of the $
402.5
 million Convertible Notes in March 2023, the Company used $
66.2
 million of the proceeds to purchase capped call instruments. In accordance with ASC 260, antidilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and purchased call options are excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share. Accordingly, any potential impact resulting from capped call transactions is excluded from our computation of diluted net income (loss) per share.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is shown below. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share, due to the fact that potentially dilutive securities would have an antidilutive effect as the Company incurred a net loss in those periods.

Segment Information:
The Company operates in 
one
, consolidated operating and reportable segment: the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of fresh dog food, cat food, and dog treats (collectively, "fresh pet food products"). The Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.
The segment derives revenues from the sale of fresh pet food products to retailers, through direct sales and distributor arrangements. Revenue from transactions with external customers for each of our fresh pet food products would be impracticable to disclose and management, including the CODM, does not view its business by product line. Although the CODM does not review such information on a regular basis, refer to Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for information about the Company's net sales by class of retailer. 
The CODM measures performance for the segment primarily based on net income (loss). The CODM uses net income (loss) to evaluate operating performance and the execution of capacity expansion plans to drive greater capital efficiency.
The measure of segment assets is reported as total assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and total capital expenditures for additions to long-lived assets were $
187,092
, $
239,093
, and $
230,071

ITEM 9. — CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROL AND PROCEDURES 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in its Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on this assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
Our independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included within "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" under section "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm".
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have

been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
