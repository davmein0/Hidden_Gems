Business

Overview

Frontier is a leading communications and technology provider offering broadband services to 3.1 million broadband customers in 25 states as of December 31, 2024. We are building critical infrastructure across the country with our fiber-optic network and cloud-based solutions, enabling secure high-speed connections. Driven by our purpose of Building Gigabit America
TM
, we are focused on supporting a digital society, closing the digital divide, and working toward a more sustainable environment.

Our investment strategy is underpinned by the rapid growth in demand for high-speed broadband, with data usage per household expected to grow significantly through over-the-top video consumption, more connected devices per household, and increased demand for upstream data (e.g., videoconferencing and gaming). We believe that our ability to provide symmetrical high-speed connectivity through our fiber-optic technology provides competitive advantages, and that we are well positioned to meet this growing demand with faster upload and download speeds, and lower latency than our competition.

In August 2021, we announced our plan to pass 10 million total locations with fiber. We prioritize our activities to locations that we believe will provide the highest investment returns. As we implement our fiber expansion plan, we expect our business mix will shift significantly, with a larger percentage of revenue coming from fiber. 

On September 4, 2024 we entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”), pursuant to which, subject to certain terms and conditions therein, Verizon will acquire Frontier for $38.50 per share in cash (the “Merger”), representing a premium of 43.7% to Frontier’s 90-Day volume-weighted average share price (VWAP) on September 3, 2024, the last full trading day prior to published market speculation regarding a potential sale of Frontier. Subject to receipt of certain required regulatory approvals and other customary conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, we currently expect the Merger to close by the first quarter of 2026.  See Note 2 - ‘‘Merger Agreement’’ to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report for more detail.

We generated revenue of approximately $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 with approximately 57% of our revenue attributable to our fiber-optic products and 42% of our revenue related to our copper products. Over time, we expect our business mix will shift significantly, with a larger percentage of revenue coming from fiber as we implement our expansion plan.

Revenue by Technology

In 2024, we advanced our purpose of Building Gigabit America and made substantial progress in executing on our four key strategic priorities: fiber deployment, fiber penetration, improving the customer experience, and operational efficiency. 

2

Key milestone accomplishments against these four strategic priorities in 2024 include: 


Fiber Deployment: 
We met

our 2024 build plan, adding approximately 1.3 million new fiber locations. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 7.8 million total locations passed with fiber, more than doubling our fiber footprint since we started our build in 2020. Our build plan is solidified by multi-year agreements with key labor and equipment partners. 

The following table shows our fiber passings as of December 31, 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020:

(1)
Fiber passings represent our estimate of the number of locations, such as single-family units, apartment and condominium units, and small and medium businesses passed by our fiber distribution network in areas where we offer service and that are open to Frontier sales efforts.


Fiber Penetration: 
We strive to deliver new best-in-market products to meet customer demands and increase penetration across our fiber footprint. We are targeting terminal penetration of 45% or higher in markets we have passed with fiber.

In 2024, we added a record 385,000 fiber broadband customer net additions, resulting in fiber broadband customer growth of 19% as compared to 2023. Fiber broadband customer net additions continued to outpace copper broadband customer net losses, resulting in 151,000 total broadband customer net additions in 2024.

‎

These record fiber broadband net additions resulted in rising fiber broadband customer penetration across our footprint. 

o
In our base fiber footprint, which consists of the 3.2 million locations that we passed with fiber at the end of 2019, penetration increased to 46.2% at the end of 2024, up from 44.5% at the end of 2023.
o
In our expansion fiber footprint, which consists of the new locations that we passed with fiber since the beginning of 2020, penetration increased to 19.6% at the end of 2024, up from 17.5% at the end of 2023.


Customer Experience: 
In 2024, we

continued to focus on improving our customer service by systematically removing reasons why customers needed to call us and introducing new digital self-service tools. Among other results: 

o
Fiber broadband churn remained low at 1.36% in 2024.
o
We reduced customer contacts into call centers by 1 million from 2023 to 2024.


Operational Efficiency: 
Across the company, we have identified opportunities to simplify and digitize our operations. We achieved our annualized gross run rate cost savings target of $500 million in 2023 – double our initial target of $250 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had realized $597 million of gross annualized cost savings. 

Customers

We deliver communications and technology services to consumer and business customers.

Consumer

Our consumer customers include customers in single or multi-family units. We provide broadband, video, voice and other value-added services and products to our consumer customers over both fiber and copper-based networks.

Business 
Our business customers include larger enterprise customers, small and medium businesses (“SMB”), and wholesale customers.

o
Larger Enterprise:
 These customers consist of Fortune 1000 companies, companies with multiple locations, large government entities, educational institutions, and non-profits.

o
Small and Medium Business:
 These customers consist of single location and smaller multi-location companies, as well as mid-sized government entities, educational institutions, and non-profits.

o
Wholesale
: 
These customers are often referred to as carriers or service providers and use our network facilities to provide services to their customers. Our wholesale customers include local, long distance, wireless, cable and other carriers. These companies need Frontier’s network to access locations within our footprint to offer their services. Wholesale customers buy both voice and data services to supplement their own network infrastructure.

Services 

We offer a broad portfolio of communications and technology services for consumer and business customers. These services are offered on either a standalone basis or in a bundled package based on individual customer needs. 

Data and Internet Services:
 We offer a comprehensive range of broadband and networking services. The principal consumer and SMB services we provide are broadband internet and related value-added services. Larger enterprise business services include a complete portfolio of ethernet services, dedicated Internet, software defined wide area network (“SDWAN”), managed Wi-Fi, traditional circuit-based data services, and optical transport services. These services are all supported by 24/7 technical support and an advanced network operations center. We also provide wireless broadband services (via unlicensed spectrum) in select markets utilizing networks that we own or operate
.

Voice Services:

We offer voice services, including data-based voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) and unified communications as a service (“UCaaS”), long-distance and voice messaging services, to consumer and business customers in all our markets. These services are billed monthly in advance. Long-distance service to and from points outside our operating properties are provided by interconnection with the facilities of other carriers. Our long-distance services are billed in advance for unlimited use service and billed in arrears for usage-based services.

Video Services:
 We provide video services under the Frontier TV brand in some of our markets, including portions of California, Indiana, Texas, Florida, and Connecticut. We also offer satellite TV video service to our customers under various agency relationships with satellite providers and Over the Top (“OTT”) video through partnerships with OTT video providers. 

Access Services:
 We offer a range of access services. Our switched access services allow other carriers to use our facilities to originate and terminate their local and long-distance voice traffic. These services are generally offered on a month-to-month basis, and the service is billed primarily on a minutes-of-use basis. Switched access charges are based on access rates filed with the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) for interstate services, and with the respective state regulatory agency for intrastate services. See “Regulatory Environment” below.

Advanced Hardware and Network Solutions: 
We offer our SMB and larger enterprise customers various hardware and network solutions utilizing cloud functionality, including end-to-end solutions like cloud managed services and Managed Wireless LAN. We offer third-party communications equipment tailored to their specific business needs through partnering with 
other providers.

Bundles:
 We also provide packages of services. These packages permit customers to bundle their products and services, including voice service, video, and broadband services, as well as other value-added services and product offerings.

Network Architecture and Technology

Our local exchange carrier networks consist of host central office and remote sites, primarily equipped with digital and Internet Protocol switches. The outside plant consists of transport and distribution delivery networks connecting our host central office with remote central offices, and ultimately, with our customers. We own fiber optic and copper cable, which have been deployed in our networks and are the primary transport technologies between our host and remote central offices, and interconnection points with other communication carriers. 

We have expanded and enhanced our fiber-optic and copper transport systems to support increasing demand for high bandwidth transport services. 
Our core fiber network is currently being upgraded to support up to 400 Gbps and in the future we believe will be capable of 800 Gbps and higher with limited additional investment.

We routinely enhance our networks and upgrade with Internet protocol transport and routing equipment, reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer transport systems, passive optical networks, ultra-high speed digital subscriber line broadband equipment, and VoIP switches. These systems support advanced services such as ethernet, dedicated Internet, VoIP, and SDWAN.

We connect to households and business locations in our service territory using fiber-optic, copper, or fixed wireless technologies. In some cases, we provide direct fiber into a residence (fiber-to-the-home) or business premise. In other cases, a location is served with a combination of fiber and copper. We provide data, video, and voice services to customers over both architectures. Additionally, we provide service using fixed wireless broadband and which is deployed for some business ethernet services. 

Competition

Competition within the wireline communications industry is intense. Technological advances as well as regulatory and legislative changes have enabled a wide range of historically non-traditional communications service providers to compete with traditional providers such as Frontier. More market participants are now competing to meet the communications needs of the same customer base, thus increasing competitive pressures.

We face competition from cable operators, wireless carriers, satellite providers, wireline carriers, fiber “overbuilders,” and OTT video providers: 

-
Cable Operators
: Cable operators offer high speed internet, video, and voice services, and compete with us aggressively for consumer and business customers on speed and price, primarily by marketing with significant promotional period pricing.

-
Wireless Carriers
: Wireless carriers offer broadband, video and voice services and compete with us for consumer and business customers by offering increasingly larger data packages that utilize the latest 5G technology to mobile customers. 

-
Satellite Providers
: Satellite providers offer broadband and video services and compete with us for consumer and business customers.

-
Wireline Carriers / Fiber Overbuilders: The demand for high-speed data is continuing to attract new entrants into markets, including Frontier’s markets. These new entrants offer broadband, video and voice services and compete directly for Frontier’s customers.

-
OTT Video Providers
: Many consumers are opting for OTT video services rather than traditional, multi-channel video services. We have made investments in our network to deliver OTT video content to consumers who might not opt for traditional video services. Additionally, we have developed partnerships with leading OTT providers to offer their services to our customers. 

Many of our competitors are larger, have stronger brand recognition, have more service offerings, and have greater financial resources than we currently do. All these factors create potential downward pressure on the demand for and pricing of our services. Further, many of our competitors are not subject to the same regulations as traditional communications providers such as Frontier and have lower cost structures than we do. The industry has also experienced substantial consolidation in recent years, leading to competitors with significant scale.

However, for the majority of our locations passed, we currently face competition from no more than one wireline competitor. In addition, we operate in many dense, urban markets with favorable demographic characteristics that correlate to higher broadband 

5

usage. As an example, we have a strong presence in Texas and Florida, the two states in the U.S. with the highest population gains from 2010 to 2021. Given our footprint, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on attractive demographic trends. 

Competition for consumer customers is based on price, bandwidth, quality, and speed of service, including promotions as well as bundling of service offerings. Our focus is to improve our customer experience by efficiently responding to their specific needs. We believe this will improve overall service quality and encourage migration to higher speed Internet services. 

Competition for business customers is also based on price, bandwidth, quality, and speed of service, including pricing and promotions and bundled offerings. As compared to our consumer customers, business customers often require more sophisticated and more data-centered solutions (e.g., IP PBX, ethernet and SIP trunking). To differentiate ourselves from other service providers, Frontier delivers end-to-end solutions such as cloud managed services and managed wireless LAN. 

As customers continue to migrate to OTT video models, broadband is a core growth component for attracting and retaining consumer customers as well as our smaller business customers. We are committed to growing our customer base through providing higher broadband speeds and capacities that we believe will enable us to reach new markets, target new customers, and grow our business while maximizing our full geographic footprint.

In addition to the focus on our broadband capabilities, we continue to evolve our other product offerings to meet the changing needs of the market, provide strong customer service and support, invest in our network to enable capacity and capabilities, and package our offerings at attractive prices. We are continuing to execute on our initiatives to build out and invest in our fiber network, drive operational performance, increasingly win more customers in our footprint, deliver an exceptional customer journey, and simplify our operations.

Regulatory Environment

Some of our operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and various state regulatory agencies, often called public service or utility commissions. We expect federal and state lawmakers, the FCC, and the state regulatory agencies to continue to revise and enforce the statutes and regulations governing communications services.

Regulation of Our Business 
We are subject to federal, state, and local regulation and we have various regulatory authorizations for our regulated service offerings. At the federal level, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over information services, interstate, or international telecommunications services and over facilities to the extent they are used to provide, originate, or terminate interstate or international services. State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications services and the facilities used to provide, originate, or terminate those services. Most of our local exchange companies operate as incumbent carriers in the states in which they operate and are certified in those states to provide local telecommunications services. Certain federal and state agencies, including attorneys general, monitor and exercise oversight related to consumer protection issues, including marketing, sales, provision of services, and service charges. In addition, local governments often regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate networks and may require service providers to 
locate and work around other utility facilities and obtain licenses or franchises to use public rights-of-way. Municipalities and other local government agencies also may regulate other aspects of our business, by requiring us to obtain licenses and construction permits and to abide by applicable regulations and requirements.

Some state regulatory agencies have substantial oversight over incumbent telephone companies, and their interconnection with competitive providers and provision of non-discriminatory network access to certain network elements to them. Under the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, state regulatory commissions have jurisdiction to set certain rates, arbitrate, and review interconnection disputes and agreements between incumbent telephone companies and CLECs, in accordance with rules set by the FCC. The FCC and some state regulatory commissions also impose fees on providers of telecommunications services to support the federal and state universal service programs. Many of the states in which we operate require prior approvals or notifications for certain acquisitions, transfers or encumbrances of assets, customers, or ownership of regulated entities. The FCC and certain states also require certain approvals or notifications to discontinue the use of certain telecommunications facilities and the provision of some services.

Additionally, in some states we are subject to operating restrictions and minimum service quality standards. Failure to meet either may result in penalties or other obligations, including subjecting the Company to additional reporting and compliance obligations. In some of our markets, the Company has also agreed to and been required by certain states to comply with additional service quality, expenditures, reporting, and other requirements. We also are required to report certain financial information. At the federal level and in a number of the states in which we operate, we are subject to price cap or incentive regulation plans under which prices for regulated services are capped. Some of these plans have limited terms and, as they expire, we may need to renegotiate with various states. These negotiations could impact rates, service quality, and/or infrastructure requirements, which could also impact our earnings and capital expenditures. In other states, we are subject to regulation that limits levels of earnings and returns on investments.
 We continue to advocate for competitive neutral policies and no or reduced regulation in all states. 
In some of the states where we operate in, we have already been successful in reducing or eliminating price regulation on end-user services.

Frontier, along with all telecommunications providers, is subject to federal and state rules governing certain of our operations and services, including the privacy of specified customer information. Among other things, these privacy-related rules obligate carriers to implement procedures to: protect specified customer information from inappropriate disclosure; obtain customer permission to 

6

use specified information in marketing; authenticate customers before disclosing account information; and periodically certify compliance with certain rules. Although most of these regulations are generally consistent with our business plans, they may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.

Some regulations are, or could in the future be, the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals or challenges that could change the manner in which the entire industry operates or the way we provide services. Neither the outcome of any of these developments, nor their potential impact on us, can be predicted at this time. Regulatory oversight and requirements can change rapidly in the communications industry, and such changes may have an adverse effect on us.

The current status of material regulatory initiatives is as follows:

Connect America Fund (“CAF”)/ Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”):

In 2015, Frontier accepted the FCC’s CAF Phase II offer, which provided $313 million in annual support through 2021 in return for the Company’s commitment to make broadband available to households within the CAF II areas in our existing 25 states. The Company was required to complete the CAF II deployment by December 31, 2021. Thereafter, USAC and the FCC have been reviewing carriers’ CAF II program completion data, and should USAC or the FCC determine that the Company did not satisfy certain applicable CAF Phase II requirements, Frontier could be required to return a portion of the funds previously received and may be subject to certain other fines, requirements and obligations.

On January 30, 2020, the FCC adopted an order establishing the RDOF competitive reverse auction to provide support to serve high-cost areas. Frontier was awarded approximately $371 million over ten years to build gigabit-capable broadband over a fiber-to-the-premises network to approximately 127,000 locations in eight states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia). We began receiving RDOF funding in the second quarter of 2022 and we will be required to complete the buildout to the awarded locations by December 31, 2028, with interim target milestones over this period. To the extent that Frontier is unable to fulfill the RDOF requirements, meet the milestones or construct to all locations by the required deadlines, funding provided to us can be discontinued and Frontier could be required to return a portion of funds previously received and may be subject to certain fines, requirements and obligations. Fines and penalties could also be assessed to the extent Frontier were ever to decide to surrender RDOF locations previously awarded. 

Federal Funding Initiatives:

The Federal government has undertaken several measures to facilitate enhanced access to high-speed broadband, including through several new funding programs. As these large amounts of federal funding flow through the broadband ecosystem, we will evaluate and pursue funding opportunities that make sense for our business. Frontier does not know what funding it may receive the impact these programs may have, or changes that may be made to these programs, if any, in the future.

In November 2021, Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”). The IIJA funds several programs dedicated to broadband expansion and upgrades, including a $2 billion tribal broadband program, a $60 million Digital Equity fund, a $2 billion Rural Utilities Service loan and grants program, and a $1 billion middle mile grants program, in addition to other smaller amounts or amounts less directly related to deployment and adoption. 

The IIJA also provides $65 billion to fund broadband connectivity programs, including broadband deployment to unserved and underserved locations. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is administering the principal last mile infrastructure funding program in the amount of $42.5 billion, the Broadband Equity, Access & Deployment Program (BEAD), and will distribute funding through direct grants to states, who will then award the funds based on competitive grant programs. The NTIA has allocated approximately $25.5 billion to states in Frontier’s footprint. The requirements and funding under these programs is subject to change. We are closely tracking implementation of the BEAD program, including state determinations regarding subsidy award criteria. We are actively pursuing awards of these stimulus funds, however, we continue to evaluate our opportunities as the process is complex and any awards that we ultimately receive under the IIJA may require significant up-front capital expenditures or other costs.

Privacy

Our businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the handling of customers’ personal information. Privacy-related legislation has been adopted in a number of states in which we operate. Certain state requirements give consumers increased rights including the right to know what personal information is being collected about them and obtain a copy of such information, opt-out of the sale of personal information or sharing of personal information for purposes of certain targeted advertising, and to request the correction or deletion of this information. Complying with such laws, as well as other legislative and regulatory action related to privacy, could result in increased costs of compliance, claims against the Company or investigations related to compliance, and increased uncertainty in the use and availability of certain consumer data.

7

Video Programming 
Federal, state, and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry. Our linear video services are subject to, among other things: subscriber privacy regulations; requirements that we carry a local broadcast station or obtain consent to carry a local or distant broadcast station; rules for franchise renewals and transfers; the manner in which program packages are marketed to subscribers; and program access requirements.

We provide video programming in some of our markets including California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, and Texas pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by state and local franchising authorities. Most franchises require payment of a franchise fee as a requirement to the granting of authority.

Many franchises establish facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. 

Environmental Regulation
The local exchange carrier subsidiaries we operate are subject to federal, state, and local laws, and regulations governing the use, storage, disposal of, and exposure to hazardous materials, the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. As an owner and former owner of property, we are subject to environmental laws that could impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup at contaminated sites, including sites formerly owned by us or our predecessors, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the activity that resulted in contamination. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. 

Segment Information
Our operations are managed and reported to our CEO, our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), on a consolidated basis. The CEO assesses performance and allocates resources based on the consolidated results of operations. Under this organizational and reporting structure, we have one reportable segment.

Intellectual Property
We own or have licenses to various trademarks, trade names and intellectual property rights that are necessary for the operation of our business.

We own or have the rights to use various trademarks, service marks and trade names referred to in this report. Solely for convenience, we refer to certain trademarks, service marks and trade names in this report without the ™, 
SM
 and 
®
 symbols. Such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent permitted by law, our rights to our trademarks, service marks and trade names. Other trademarks, trade names or service marks appearing in this report are the property of their respective owners.

Human Capital Management 
We are building a high-performing and diverse workforce committed to our purpose of Building Gigabit 
America
TM
. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 13,000 employees.

Our Board of Directors and executive leadership team oversee the execution of our fiber-first strategy: build fiber, sell fiber, improve the customer experience, and simplify operations. Motivated by a belief that Frontier’s success depends on our employees’ success, we strive to provide the skills they need to thrive by creating an inclusive culture that rewards them with competitive compensation and benefits, makes safety paramount, and nurtures professional and personal development.

Talent Engagement and Development
We continue to invest in making Frontier a great place to work, where people develop through support, challenge, respect, and reward. When we create a culture that allows our people to be themselves, we find that they become their best selves. And that makes us a better company. 
In 2024, we continued to advance our culture through: 

Employee Forums: Our leadership team hosts regular all-hands meetings to share progress on priorities and solicit feedback from employees. For example, our CEO’s monthly “Listen Live” events are open to all employees. During these calls, we discuss new products and programs, recognize individuals who go above and beyond, and answer our employees’ questions live. 


Performance Management: Our end-to-end performance management program for non-union teammates reinforces goal setting, alignment to our strategic priorities, development planning, performance coaching and feedback enhancing our pay-for-performance culture. 


Employee Development: We launched a new professional development program, Frontier Forward. Through the program, we are offering every leader and employee opportunities to learn, grow and develop in their career. This year, we also offered a range of mentoring opportunities and development workshops response to employee feedback.

8


Frontline Training: We added new programs to further develop our customer-facing teammates including training on our products, services and technology. Our Door-to-Door sales teams received individualized training to increase their sales potential through AI generated insights on their performance. 


Recognition: We continued our Changemaker program, recognizing the most outstanding builders of Gigabit America. Every quarter we award winners, one of whom becomes Changemaker of the Year. We also launched a new program called Frontier Heroes that recognizes teammates who have performed courageous acts. 


Community Engagement: Through our Broadband for Good program, our employees helped strengthen the communities we serve by donating fiber internet and critical resources to 50% more non-profits this year.  

Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees is our top priority, and 2024 was our safest year yet. We set new safety records for our company — building on our 2023 results with year-over-year improvements on key safety measures. 

Our people made a collective effort to build a safer work environment, and we prioritized policies and habits that encompassed both industry best practices and the lessons employees learned on the job. We’re proud of how far we’ve come in building a safer work environment, and we’re constantly looking for ways to do better. 

To continue to strengthen our safety culture, we use monthly scorecards to track and review our performance at every level of the organization– from EVPs to the frontline supervisors. We compare our performance against the Bureau of Labor Statistics for our industry category as well as research data and practices in similar industries to help with our assessments and, along with team-member feedback, to make improvements.

Across Frontier, senior leaders have embraced the importance of safety and promoting it across the organization. And out on the road, we are using telematics in our fleet to help reinforce our safety practices to ensure safety is part of our everyday working life in all corners of the company.

Our commitment to safety is guided by our Occupational Safety & Health Program and reinforced by our Environmental Health and Safety Methods and Procedures. Together, they provide a framework for identifying, controlling and reducing risks.

As a standard practice, we maintain environmental, health, and safety compliance programs, including ongoing safety training for our field technicians.

Our Workforce
Our employee base decreased by approximately 2% from approximately 13,300 employees as of December 31, 2023 to approximately 13,000 as of December 31, 2024. Approximately 66% of our total employees are represented by unions and are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The term of our collective bargaining agreements is typically three years and at any point in time we generally have several agreements under negotiation and on extension. Approximately 43% of our unionized employees are covered by collective agreements that are scheduled to expire in 2025. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.

In addition, our workforce is currently supplemented by approximately 126 contract workers, primarily in construction planning. We are a federal contractor and follow the rules set forth by the Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), including those applicable to recruiting, hiring and diversity.
