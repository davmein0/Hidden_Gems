Item 3. 
Legal Proceedings

We are party to various legal proceedings (including individual, class and putative class actions as well as federal and state governmental investigations) arising in the normal course of our business covering a wide range of matters and types of claims including, but not limited to, general contracts, billing disputes, rights of access, taxes and surcharges, consumer protection and privacy, trademark, copyright and patent infringement, employment, regulatory, tort, claims of competitors and disputes with other carriers.

This section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Business Overview 
Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. is a leading communications and technology provider offering broadband services to approximately 3.1 million broadband customers, with approximately 13,000 employees, operating in 25 states as of December 31, 2024. We are building critical infrastructure across the country with our fiber-optic network and cloud-based solutions, enabling secure high-speed connections. Driven by our purpose of Building Gigabit America
TM
, we are focused on supporting a digital society, closing the digital divide, and working toward a more sustainable environment.

In 2020, we began the expansion and transformation of our fiber network to meet the rapidly increasing demand for data from our consumer and business customers. We believe that a fiber network has competitive advantages to be able to meet this growing demand, including faster download speeds, faster upload speeds, and lower latency levels than alternative broadband services.

In August 2021, we announced our plan to pass 10 million total locations with fiber. We are prioritizing our activities to locations that we believe will provide the highest investment returns. Over time, we expect our business mix will shift significantly, with a larger percentage of revenue coming from fiber as we implement our expansion plan. 

Our strategy focuses on four 
strategic priorities
: fiber deployment, fiber penetration, operational efficiency, and improving the customer experience. We accomplished the following objectives in 2024:


We added approximately 1.3 million fiber passings. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 7.8 million total locations passed with fiber. 


We added 385,000 fiber broadband customer net additions, resulting in fiber broadband customer growth of 19% as compared to the prior year. In our base fiber footprint of 3.2 million locations, we reached broadband penetration of 46.2%.


Fiber broadband customer net additions continued to outpace copper broadband customer net losses, resulting in 151,000 total broadband customer net additions.


Revenue growth of 3% year-over-year, as fiber revenue growth of 14% offset copper revenue declines of 8%.


We improved our liquidity and cost of capital through the issuance of $750 million low-cost fiber securitization notes, the addition of a $1.5 billion delayed draw term loan facility, and the refinancing and repricing of our $1.02 billion term loan.
 These transactions reduced the ongoing cost of funding our fiber upgrade program. 


We achieved our annualized gross run rate cost savings target of $500 million at the end of 2023 – double our initial goal of $250 million. As of December 31, 2024, we had realized $597 million of gross annualized cost savings since 2021.

On September 4, 2024 we entered into the Merger Agreement with Verizon, pursuant to which, subject to certain terms and conditions therein, Verizon will acquire Frontier for $38.50 per share in cash, representing a premium of 43.7% to Frontier’s 90-Day volume-weighted average share price (VWAP) on September 3, 2024, the last full trading day prior to published market speculation regarding a potential sale of Frontier. Subject to receipt of certain required regulatory approvals and other customary conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, we currently expect the Merger to close by the first quarter of 2026.  See Note 2 - ‘‘Merger Agreement’’ to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report for more detail.

Our fiber build plans include significant expenditures which could be adversely impacted by supply chain delays, actual or perceived inflation, tight labor markets, increased fuel and electricity costs, increases in the cost of borrowing, and other risks. In addition to higher costs, the availability of building materials and other supply chain risks could negatively impact our ability to achieve the fiber build plans we are executing against. We continue to closely monitor and evaluate the impact these and other factors may have on our business, including demand for our products and services, our ability to execute on our strategic priorities and our financial condition and results of operations.

Financial Overview – Operating Income
We reported operating income of $353 million and $492 million, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of $139 million. 

Operating income decreased primarily due to decreases in revenue from voice and video services and increases in selling, general and administrative expenses, and in depreciation and amortization expense. These factors were partially offset by an increase in data and internet services revenue, as well as decreases in cost of service as compared to 2023. 

Presentation of Results of Operations 
The sections below include tables that present customer counts, average monthly consumer revenue per customer (“ARPC”), average monthly revenue per unit (“ARPU”), and consumer customer churn. We define churn as the number of consumer customer deactivations during the month divided by the number of consumer customers at the beginning of the month and utilize the average of each monthly churn in the period. Management believes that consumer customer counts, ARPC, ARPU, and consumer customer churn are important factors in evaluating our consumer customer trends. Among the key services we provide to consumer customers are voice service, data service and video service. We continue to explore the potential to provide additional services to our customer base, with the objective of meeting our customers’ communications needs.

Fiber Broadband Customers
Our investment strategy is focused on expanding our fiber network. In conjunction with this strategy, we are also working to improve our product positioning in both existing and new fiber markets.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we added approximately 371,000 consumer fiber broadband customers compared to approximately 303,000 in 202
3. 
Customers who migrated from our copper base constituted a minor portion of these consumer fiber broadband customer net additions in 2024.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we added approximately 14,000 business and wholesale fiber broadband customers compared to approximately 15,000 in 2023. 

Our focus on expanding and improving our fiber network has contributed to healthy customer retention. Our average monthly consumer fiber broadband churn was 1.36% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 1.32% in 2023. These consistent results were driven by our continued focus on key customer touchpoints such as installation and first bill and reflect retention activities associated with inflation-related pricing actions and the end of certain promotion pricing periods.

o
The average monthly consumer fiber broadband revenue per customer (“consumer ARPU”) increased $2.15, or 3%, to     
$65.54 in 2024, compared to $63.39 in 2023. 

o
The increase in consumer ARPU for the year ended December 31, 2024 was due to higher intake pricing, customer shifts 
to higher broadband speeds, customers rolling off promotional pricing, and lower gift card redemptions, all partially offset by increased retention activity and autopay take rates.

Copper Broadband Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we lost approximately 210,000 consumer copper broadband customers compared to a loss of approximately 221,000 in 2023. 

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we lost approximately 24,000 business and wholesale copper broadband customers compared to a loss of approximately 22,000 in 2023. 

Our average monthly consumer copper broadband churn was 2.22% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 1.90% in 2023. The increase in consumer copper broadband churn was driven by the impact of inflationary price increases and changes to our copper broadband go to market approach which impacted gross add volume.

Consumer Customers
We experienced an increase in consumer customers of 2% as of December 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023.

Consumer customer gains were driven by net additions of fiber broadband customers, partially offset by reductions in our copper broadband and stand-alone voice customers. Customer preferences as well as our fiber investment initiatives resulted in an increase in the number of our consumer broadband customers and a migration of our copper customers to fiber.


We gained approximately 64,000 consumer customers for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a loss of approximately 4,000 consumer customers for the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by growth in fiber broadband customers and partially offset by losses in copper broadband, voice and video customers. 


For the year ended December 31, 2024, we experienced a net gain of consumer broadband customers of approximately 161,000 as compared to a net gain of approximately 82,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

o
The average monthly consumer revenue per customer (“consumer ARPC”) increased $1.00, or 1%, to $83.53 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year period. The slight increase was driven primarily by growth in fiber data and value-added services along with price increases, partially offset by declines in voice and video services. We have de-emphasized the sale of low margin video products, which has historically been a material part of the overall ARPC. Going forward, we expect moderate movements in ARPC as our customer mix becomes more weighted towards broadband services.

Includes $52 million and $62 million of lease revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Our revenue streams are primarily a result of recurring data, voice, and video services delivered over our fiber and copper network. Revenues are considered fiber or copper based on the “last-mile” technology used to connect the customer location. With our investment strategy to expand and improve our fiber network and the corresponding fiber focus of our sales and marketing efforts, we are experiencing growth in fiber broadband revenue and a decline in copper revenue. We expect this trend to continue and accelerate due to strong fiber demand and the migration of customers from copper to fiber as we expand our fiber network.

Includes $52 million and $62 million of lease revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We conduct business with a range of consumer, business, and wholesale customers, and we generate both recurring and non-recurring revenues. Recurring revenues are primarily billed at fixed recurring rates, with some services billed based on usage. Revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management, with the exception of a determination of the provision for expected credit losses.

Consumer
For the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023:


Consumer revenues increased approximately 2% for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The revenue growth was the result of growth in fiber data and value added service revenues along with inflationary price increases, offset by declines in voice, video, and copper broadband.

o
We experienced a 23% improvement in consumer fiber broadband revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. 

o
This improvement is a result of higher consumer fiber broadband ARPU as well as increase net adds of consumer fiber broadband customers due to our expanded fiber footprint and continued focus on product positioning in both new and existing markets.


We experienced a decline of approximately 13% in consumer copper broadband revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. As our copper footprint transitions to fiber, we expect fewer copper sales opportunities, and will proactively migrate certain existing broadband customers from copper to fiber, both of which will reduce our copper net adds. 

Business and Wholesale
For the year ended December 31, 2024, our business and wholesale revenues increased 5%, as compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by increases in fiber broadband and network access services, partially offset by decreases in voice revenue predominantly in business. The increase in fiber broadband was due to continued growth of our customer base, and a shift towards higher broadband speeds. The increase in network access services is due primarily to price adjustments as well as install and upgrade activity.

We categorize our products, services, and other revenues into the following five categories:

Data and Internet Services 
We provide data and Internet services to our consumer, business, and wholesale customers. Data and Internet services consist of fiber broadband services, copper broadband services, and network access revenues (data transmission services and dedicated high-capacity circuits including data services to wireless providers commonly called wireless backhaul). Network access services are provided primarily to our business and wholesale customers, while fiber and copper broadband are provided to all customer segments.

Our fiber expansion strategy is expected to positively impact data and Internet services. This network expansion is designed to provide faster, symmetrical broadband speeds and provide customer and revenue growth opportunities for fiber broadband and certain network access products like ethernet. We believe this initiative will create opportunities for us to provide more fiber-based services to our customers.

Data and Internet services revenue, December 31, 2024
$
 3,963 

Data and internet services revenue increased $429 million, or 12%, to $3,963 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by growth in the fiber broadband and network access revenues, partly offset by declines in copper broadband revenue. 

Voice services
We provide voice services consisting of traditional local and long-distance service and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) service provided over our fiber and copper broadband products. It also includes enhanced features such as call waiting, caller identification, and voice messaging services.

Voice services revenue declined $142 million, or 10%, to $1,231 million, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to net losses in business and consumer customers in addition to fewer customers bundling voice services with broadband as compared to the prior year period, all partially offset by higher voice services ARPU. 

Video services
Video services include revenues generated from traditional television (TV) services provided directly to consumer customers as well as satellite TV services provided through 
various satellite providers
. Video services also includes pay-per-view revenues, video on demand, equipment rentals, and video advertising. We have made the strategic decision to limit sales of new traditional TV services, focusing on our broadband products and OTT video options. We are partnering with OTT video providers and expect this to grow as OTT options are offered with our broadband products. 

Video services revenue declined $86 million, or 20%, to $344 million, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by traditional video customer losses, partially offset by price increases as compared to the prior year.

Other 
Other customer revenue includes non-recurring equipment sales, network facility rental income, ancillary customer fees, directory listing services and switched access revenue. Switched access revenue includes revenue derived from allowing other carriers to use our network to originate and/or terminate their local and long-distance voice traffic. These switched access services are primarily billed on a minutes-of-use basis applying tariffed rates filed with the FCC or state agencies.

Other customer revenue decreased $4 million, or 1%, to $335 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, 
as compared to the prior year period driven by decreases in rent, switched access and equipment sales, partially offset by higher other fees. 

Subsidy and other revenue
Subsidy and other revenue decreased $11 million, or 15%, to $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in federal and state subsidies.

Cost of Service
Cost of service expenses include access charges and other third-party costs directly attributable to connecting customer locations to our network and video content costs. Such access charges and other third-party costs exclude depreciation and amortization, and employee related expenses. 

Cost of service decreased $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. The decrease in cost of service expense was driven by lower video content costs as a result of declines in video customers, non-renewal of certain content agreements, and decreased CPE costs. These decreases more than offset higher energy and outside service rate increases resulting from higher inflation.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A expenses”) include the salaries, wages and related benefits and costs of corporate and sales personnel, travel, insurance, non-network related rent, advertising, and other administrative expenses. 

SG&A expenses increased by $79 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of increases in marketing costs, third party commissions, property taxes, and a settled dispute with the Chief Executive Officer of Frontier’s predecessor company, partially offset by lower compensation and other fees.

Pension and Other post-employment benefits (“OPEB”) costs
We allocate certain pension/OPEB expense to cost of service and SG&A expenses. Total pension and OPEB service costs were as follows

Depreciation and Amortization
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the increased depreciation and amortization expense was driven by higher depreciation expense as a result of higher property, plant and equipment in service. 

Restructuring costs and other charges
Restructuring costs and other charges consist of consulting and advisory fees, workforce reductions, transformation initiatives, and other restructuring expenses.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, restructuring costs and other charges increased $51 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher pension/OPEB special termination benefit enhancement costs related to a voluntary severance program, costs associated with the Verizon merger and other restructuring activities, slightly offset by lower severance and employee costs.

Investment and other income, net
Investment and other income, net decreased by $173 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a remeasurement loss to our pension plan of $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a remeasurement 
gain of $202 million
 for the year ended December 31, 2023, partially offset by a remeasurement gain to our postretirement benefit plan of $35 million, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a remeasurement loss of $3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Interest expense
For the year ended December 31, 2024, interest expense increased $151 million, as compared to 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily driven by a higher debt balance. 

Income tax expense (benefit)
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of $24 million on pre-tax loss of $346 million. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 
7.0%.

(b) 
Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2024, we had liquidity of approximately $2,910 million, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $750 million, the available capacity on our delayed draw term loan facility of $1,500 million and undrawn revolving credit facility of $660 million.

On December 31, 2024, our subsidiaries Frontier Tampa Bay FL Fiber 1 LLC (“Borrower”) and Frontier SPE FL Guarantor LLC (“Guarantor”) entered into a credit agreement (the “Warehouse Credit Agreement”) with certain lenders that established and governs certain credit facilities (the “Warehouse Facilities”) including (i) a delayed draw term loan facility (the “DDTL Facility”) of $1.5 billion, less commitments reserved for letters of credit, and (ii) an incremental term loan facility under which the subsidiary borrower has the right to increase the commitments under the DDTL Facility by up to $750 million.  

In connection with the establishment of the DDTL Facility, Frontier Issuer LLC canceled its agreement relating to the potential issuance of a $500 million Secured Fiber Network Revenue Variable Funding Notes, Series 2023-2, Class A-1 facility.

On July 1, 2024, Frontier Issuer LLC amended its Secured Fiber Network Revenue Variable Funding Notes, Series 2023-2, Class A-1 facility (the “VFN Amendment”) to reduce the available Variable Funding Notes commitment amount to $0, with the ability to increase the commitment amount up to $500 million in the future upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, and to extend the maturity date to June 2028.

Analysis of Cash Flows
As of December 31, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents aggregating $750 million. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we used cash flow from operations, cash on hand, and cash from borrowings principally to fund our cash investing and financing activities, which were primarily capital expenditures. 

As of 
December 31, 2024
, we had a working capital deficit of $
1,029 
million compared to a $506 million surplus at December 31, 2023. The primary drivers for the change to the working capital deficit at 
December 31, 2024
 were a decrease in short-term investments of $1,075 million, a decrease of $375 million in cash and cash equivalents, a decrease to vendor financing payables of $247 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $67 million, partially offset by an increase of $82 million in other current liabilities as compared to the period ended December 31, 2023.

Cash Flows provided from Operating Activities

Cash flows provided from operating activities increased $277 million to $1,621 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 2023. The overall increase in operating cash flows was primarily the result of changes in working capital. 

We received $10 million in net cash taxes during the year ended December 31, 2024, and we paid less than $1 million in net cash taxes during the year ended December 31, 2023.

37

Cash Flows used by Investing Activities

Cash flows used by investing activities were $1,681 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to cash flows used by investing activities of $2,556 million in 2023, 
due to a decrease of $428 million in capital expenditures and an increase from the activity of purchases and sales of short-term investments as compared to the prior year period.

Capital Expenditures
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, our capital expenditures were $2,783 million and $3,211 million, respectively. 
The decrease in capital expenditures is due to a greater proportion of capital payments classified as a financing activity in the cash flows for vendor financing in 2024 when compared to the prior year period.

Cash Flows used by Financing Activities

Cash flows used by financing activities decreased $2,397 million to $268 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 
2023. 
The decrease in financing activities was primarily driven by the decrease in net proceeds from long-term debt borrowings, an increase in long-term debt principal payments and an increase in vendor financing payments in 2024.

Capital Resources
Our primary anticipated uses of liquidity are to fund the costs of operations, working capital and capital expenditures and to fund interest payments on our long-term debt. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand and borrowing capacity under our $1,500 million DDTL Facility and $925 million Revolving Facility (as reduced by $265 million of revolver Letters of Credit). 

We have negotiated payment terms with certain of our vendors, (referred to as vendor financing), which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had $16 million and $263 million, respectively, of vendor financing liabilities included in “Other current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $2,783 million, and when including $463 million cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was $3,246 million.

We have assessed our current and expected funding requirements and our current and expected sources of liquidity, and have determined, based on our forecasted financial results and financial condition as of December 31, 2024, that our operating cash flows, existing cash balances and capacity under our DDTL and Revolving Credit Facilities, will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, make required debt interest and principal payments, pay taxes and make other payments over the next twelve months. 
A number of factors, including, but not limited to, loss of customers, pricing pressure from increased competition, lower subsidy and switched access revenues, and the impact of economic conditions, may negatively affect our cash generated from operations.

Credit Facilities and Term Loans

Revolving Facility

On May 22, 2024, Frontier Communications Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Frontier (“Frontier Holdings”), entered into an amendment (the “2024 Credit Agreement Amendment”) to its existing credit agreement that governs its senior secured credit facility with certain revolving credit lenders (the “Revolving Facility”) which, among other things, (i) increased the aggregate amount of certain additional obligations permitted to be outstanding, including first lien debt, and securitization and receivables facilities, and non-loan party debt, from $2,500 million to $5,500 million; provided that at least 40% of the net available cash from the first $1,915 million in securitization and receivables facilities received after May 22, 2024 (excluding net available cash received from drawings with respect to $500 million of commitments of Variable Funding Notes) is applied to prepay Frontier Holdings’ existing term loans and other applicable indebtedness, and 100% of the net available cash from securitization and receivables facilities in excess thereof (up to the cap of $5,500 million) shall be applied to prepay Frontier Holdings’ existing term loans and other applicable indebtedness; (ii) limited future securitizations and receivables facilities to assets located in Texas and/or Florida; and (iii) amended the financial maintenance covenant for the benefit of the Revolving Facility by, commencing with the period ending June 30, 2024, (a) including outstanding securitization and receivables facilities in the calculation of indebtedness and (b) increasing the maximum financial maintenance covenant leverage ratio thereunder to 5.25:1.00, with a step-down to 4.75:1.00 commencing with the period ending March 31, 2027, and continuing thereafter. The 2024 Credit Agreement Amendment became effective on July 1, 2024, when $402 million of net available cash from the securitization closing on such date was applied to prepay existing term loans.

On July 30, 2024, Frontier Holdings entered into a further amendment to its existing credit agreement that governs its Revolving Facility, pursuant to which $50 million of revolving credit commitments of a terminating lender were replaced by $75 million of commitments from a new lender, increasing overall capacity from $900 million to $925 million. The maturity date of the Revolving Facility will be the earliest of (a) April 30, 2028, (b) 91 days prior to the maturity of the term loan facility, (c) unless such notes have been repaid and/or redeemed in full, the date that is 91 days prior to the stated maturity date of our 5.875% First Lien Notes due 

38

2027, and (d) unless such notes have been repaid and/or redeemed in full, the date that is 91 days prior to the stated maturity date of our 5.000% First Lien Notes due 2028.

Term Loan Facility

On January 14, 2025, Frontier Holdings entered into an amendment to its existing Term Loan Facility, which, among other things, (x) further lowered the margin over adjusted Term SOFR with respect to the Term Loan from 3.50% to 2.50% and (y) further lowered the margin over the alternative base rate with respect to the Term loan from 2.50% to 1.50%. On July 1, 2024, Frontier Holdings entered into an amendment to the Term Loan Facility which, among other things, extended the maturity date of $1.025 billion of the Term Loan to July 1, 2031 and eliminated the credit spread adjustment previously applicable to the Term Loan. 

Fiber Network Revenue Term Notes

On July 1, 2024, Frontier Issuer LLC (“Frontier Issuer”), the Company’s limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, subsidiary completed the issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of secured fiber network revenue term notes consisting of $530 million 6.19% Series 2024-1, Class A-2 term notes, $73 million 7.02% Series 2024-1, Class B term notes and $147 million 11.16% Series 2024-1, Class C term notes, each with an anticipated repayment term of seven years (collectively, the “Fiber Term Notes”). The Fiber Term Notes have a weighted average yield of approximately 7.4%. The Fiber Term Notes are secured by certain of Frontier’s fiber assets and associated customer contracts in the North Texas Area, in addition to those in the Dallas Metropolitan Area contributed in the Series 2023-1 Notes offering.

Warehouse Facilities

On December 31, 2024 (the “Warehouse Effective Date”), Frontier Tampa Bay FL Fiber 1 LLC (the “Warehouse Borrower”) and Frontier SPE FL Guarantor LLC, as guarantor (the “Warehouse Guarantor”), each a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement (the “Warehouse Credit Agreement”) with certain lenders that establishes and governs certain credit facilities (the “Warehouse Facilities”). The Warehouse Facilities include:


A delayed draw term loan facility (the “DDTL Facility”) of $1.5 billion, less commitments reserved for letters of credit (the “Maximum DDTL Amount”). The DDTL Facility is available from the Warehouse Effective Date until the earlier of the full draw of the Maximum DDTL Amount or the third anniversary of the Warehouse Effective Date (such earlier date, the “DDTL Commitment Expiration Date”). To draw amounts under the DDTL Facility, the Warehouse Borrower must comply with a total leverage ratio of no more than 6.75:1.00 and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 2.00:1.00. Additionally, no defaults or other specified conditions may be continuing, and all conditions precedent for each extension of credit must be satisfied. The Warehouse Borrower must repay all outstanding amounts under the DDTL Facility due on the fifth anniversary of the Warehouse Effective Date. The interest rate for the DDTL Facility is either, at the sole discretion of the Warehouse Borrower, for Base Rate Loans, (a) the highest of (i) the “U.S. Prime Lending Rate” published by the Wall Street Journal, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as agreed to in good faith by the parties to the Warehouse Credit Agreement) plus 0.50%, and (iii) one-month Term SOFR plus 1.00% per annum, plus (b) 0.75%, with step-ups from and after the third anniversary, or, for SOFR Loans, Term SOFR plus 1.75%, with step-ups from and after the third anniversary. Optional prepayments are allowed without fees or penalties, subject to notice requirements. A portion of the DDTL Facility, up to $200 million, is reserved as a letter of credit sublimit.


An incremental term loan facility (the “Incremental Term Loan”) under which the Warehouse Borrower has the right to increase the commitments under the DDTL Facility by up to $750 million after the DDTL Commitment Expiration Date. No lender is required to increase its commitment. The Warehouse Borrower must comply with all representations and warranties, and the terms of any Incremental Term Loan must be identical to those of the DDTL Facilities, including maturity, priority of liens, prepayment terms, and pricing.

In the event of default, an additional 2.00% per annum will be applied to overdue amounts. Fees include commitment fees on undrawn portions, letter of credit fees, and fronting fees. The Warehouse Facilities are secured by first-priority pledges of equity interests and security interests in substantially all owned tangible and intangible assets of the Warehouse Borrower and its guarantors, which consist of the Warehouse Borrower’s fiber network assets and associated customer contracts in certain neighborhoods in the Tampa, Florida area. 

Debt Covenants and Borrowing Capacity

Credit Agreement 

Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes usual and customary negative covenants for loan agreements of this type, including covenants limiting us and our restricted subsidiaries’ (other than certain covenants therein which are limited to subsidiary guarantors) ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions and make payments in respect of certain material subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for loan agreements of this type.

39

Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains a “financial covenant” which provides that, commencing with the period ending June 30, 2024, our financial maintenance covenant leverage ratio shall not exceed as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 5.25:1.00, with a step-down to 4.75:1.00 commencing with the period ending March 31, 2027, and continuing thereafter.

This financial covenant is only applicable for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) thereunder and failure to comply with the financial covenant would not cause an Event of Default with respect to any loans pursuant to our term loan facility unless and until the Required Revolving Lenders (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) have declared all amounts outstanding under the revolving facility to be immediately due and payable and all outstanding commitments under the revolving facility to be immediately terminated.

First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes

The indentures governing our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes also include usual and customary negative covenants for debt securities of this type, including covenants limiting us and our restricted subsidiaries’ (other than certain covenants therein which are limited to subsidiary guarantors) ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions and make payments in respect of certain material subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for debt securities of this type.

The indentures governing the outstanding subsidiary debentures include covenants that limit such subsidiary’s ability to create liens and/or merge or consolidate with other companies. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications.

Fiber Term Notes

The indenture governing Frontier Issuer’s Fiber Term Notes includes covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type. These covenants and restrictions include the maintenance of a liquidity reserve account to be used to make required payments in respect of the Fiber Term Notes, provisions relating to prepayments, required indemnification payments in certain circumstances. The Fiber Term Notes are also subject to rapid amortization in the event of a failure to maintain a stated debt service coverage ratio. A rapid amortization may be cured if the debt service coverage ratio exceeds a certain threshold for a certain period of time, upon which cure, regular amortization, if any, will resume. The Fiber Term Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Fiber Term Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective and certain judgments.

The Fiber Term Notes are subject to covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Fiber Term Notes and pay certain reserved fixed costs of the fiber networks, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments of the Fiber Term Notes and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of prepayments of the Fiber Term Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Fiber Term Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective, and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters.  In addition, the terms of the indenture governing the Fiber Term Notes provide that a larger portion of Frontier Issuer’s available funds will be used towards the repayment of the Fiber Term Notes during a cash sweep period, which period would result from, among other things, the failure to maintain a certain debt service coverage ratio or a certain minimum penetration rate in the markets that were securitized at closing. The Fiber Term Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the acceleration of the maturity of the Fiber Term Notes following the occurrence of an event of default and the failure to repay or refinance on the applicable Anticipated Repayment Date (“ARD”). 

The customary events of default to which the Fiber Term Notes are subject include events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Fiber Term Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective and certain judgments. In addition, the Indenture and the related management agreement contain various covenants that limit the ability of the Company’s securitized subsidiaries to engage in specified types of transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets.

As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our existing indentures and the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

Warehouse Facilities

The Warehouse Credit Agreement includes covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type.  The DDTL Facility contains a financial covenant which provides that the subsidiary borrower must comply with a total leverage ratio of no more than 6:75:1.00 and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 2:00:1:00, in addition to other customary conditions.

Future Commitments

See “Regulatory Developments” immediately below for information regarding Frontier’s known and potential future commitments related to our participation in the FCC’s CAF Phase II program, NTIA BEAD program, and RDOF Phase I auction.

Regulatory Developments 
Connect America Fund (“CAF”)/ Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”): In 2015, Frontier accepted the FCC’s CAF Phase II offer, which provided $313 million in annual support through 2021 in return for the Company’s commitment to make broadband available to households within the CAF II areas in our existing 25 states. The Company was required to complete the CAF II deployment by December 31, 2021. Thereafter, USAC and the FCC have been reviewing carriers’ CAF II program completion data, and should USAC or the FCC determine that the Company did not satisfy certain applicable CAF Phase II requirements, Frontier could be required to return a portion of the funds previously received and may be subject to certain other fines, requirements and obligations.

On January 30, 2020, the FCC adopted an order establishing the RDOF competitive reverse auction to provide support to serve high-cost areas. Frontier was awarded approximately $371 million over ten years to build gigabit-capable broadband over a fiber-to-the-premises network to approximately 127,000 locations in eight states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia). We began receiving RDOF funding in the second quarter of 2022 and we will be required to complete the buildout to the awarded locations by December 31, 2028, with interim target milestones over this period. To the extent that Frontier is unable to fulfill the RDOF requirements, meet the milestones or construct to all locations by the required deadlines, funding to us could be discontinued and Frontier could be required to return a portion of funds previously received and may be subject to certain fines, requirements and obligations.

 Fines and penalties could also be assessed to the extent Frontier were ever to decide to surrender RDOF locations previously awarded. 

In November 2021, Congress passed the IIJA which provides $65 billion to fund broadband connectivity programs, including broadband deployment to unserved and underserved locations. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is administering the principal last mile infrastructure funding program in the amount of $42.5 billion, the Broadband Equity, Access & Deployment Program (BEAD), and will distribute funding through direct grants to states, who will then award the funds based on competitive grant programs. The NTIA has allocated approximately $25.5 billion to states in Frontier’s footprint. We are closely tracking implementation of the BEAD program, including state determinations regarding subsidy award criteria. We are actively pursuing awards of these stimulus funds, however, we continue to evaluate our opportunities as the process is complex and any awards that we ultimately receive under the IIJA may require significant up-front capital expenditures or other costs.

On January 27, 2025, the federal Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) issued a memorandum to the heads of all executive departments and agencies directing them to pause the disbursement of certain federal financial assistance. On January 28, 2025, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued a temporary stay of the OMB directive and which the OMB subsequently rescinded. It is uncertain if the OMB will seek to further pause or otherwise limit future federal disbursements, or if any such changes would impact the funding Frontier receives under federal programs, including USF, RDOF and other federal broadband grants including BEAD.  We are closely tracking developments in this area.  Significant decreases in available funding, or the imposition of significant requirements on the receipt of such funding, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Privacy:
 Our businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the handling of customers’ personal information. Privacy-related legislation has been adopted in a number of states in which we operate. Certain state requirements give consumers increased rights including the right to know what personal information is being collected about them and obtain a copy of such information, opt-out of the sale of personal information or sharing of personal information for purposes of certain targeted advertising, and to request the correction or deletion of this information. Complying with such laws, as well as other legislative and regulatory action related to privacy, could result in increased costs of compliance, claims 

41

against the Company or investigations related to compliance, and increased uncertainty in the use and availability of certain consumer data.

Video Programming:
 Federal, state, and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry. Our linear video services are subject to, among other things: subscriber privacy regulations; requirements that we carry a local broadcast station or obtain consent to carry a local or distant broadcast station; rules for franchise renewals and transfers; the manner in which program packages are marketed to subscribers; and program access requirements.

We provide video programming in some of our markets including California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, and Texas pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by state and local franchising authorities. Most franchises require payment of a franchise fee as a requirement to the granting of authority.

Many franchises establish facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. We believe that we are meeting all material standards and requirements. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed.

Environmental Regulation:
 The local exchange carrier subsidiaries we operate are subject to federal, state, and local laws, and regulations governing the use, storage, disposal of, and exposure to hazardous materials, the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. As an owner and former owner of property, we are subject to environmental laws that could impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup at contaminated sites, including sites formerly owned by us or our predecessors, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the activity that resulted in contamination. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. There are inherent uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. 
These critical accounting estimates have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. For a discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimate of our ability to collect accounts receivable. Our estimates are based on assumptions and other considerations, including payment history, customer financial performance, carrier billing disputes and aging analysis. Our estimation process includes general and specific reserves and varies by customer category. In 2024 and 2023, we had no “critical estimates” related to bankruptcies of communications companies or any other significant customers. See Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Depreciation 
The calculation of depreciation expense is based upon the estimated useful lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment. Depreciation expense is principally based on the composite group method for substantially all of our property, plant, and equipment assets. The estimates for remaining lives of the various asset categories are determined annually, based on an independent study. Among other considerations, these studies include models that consider actual usage, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution for each category of asset. The latest study was completed in the fourth quarter of 2024 and did not result in any significant changes in remaining lives for any of our asset categories. A one-year decrease in the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment would result in an increase of approximately $156 million to depreciation expense.

See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Asset Impairments
We review long-lived assets to be held and used, including customer lists, finite-lived intangible assets, and long-lived assets to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. When triggering events are identified, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair market value. If any assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value. Also, we periodically reassess the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets to determine whether any changes are required.

We considered whether the carrying values of finite-lived intangible assets, and property plant and equipment may not be recoverable or whether the carrying value of certain finite-lived intangible assets were impaired, noting no impairment was present as of or for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of our current and former employees as well as other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental, life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents. As of December 31, 2024, the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was $630 million. During 2024, we contributed $171 million to these plans in cash and recorded $54 

42

million of operating expense before capitalization, and $13 million of net non-operating income. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

Our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long-term, high quality corporate bonds with durations approximate to that of our benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, we utilized an estimation technique that is based upon a settlement model (Bond:Link) that permits us to closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants. This rate can change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields.

We are utilizing a discount rate of 5.60% as of December 31, 2024, for our qualified pension plan, compared to rates of 5.20% and 5.50% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The discount rate for postretirement plans as of December 31, 2024, was 5.70% compared to 5.20% in 2023 and 5.50% in 2022.

In the following table, we show the estimated sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2024:

In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5-year, 10-year and 20-year investment returns. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 65% in long-duration fixed income securities, and 35% in equity securities and other investments. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. Our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of our fiscal year. In 2023 and 2022, our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 7.50%. For the period January 1, 2024 – September 30, 2024, our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 7.50%. For the period October 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 6.65%. Our actual return on plan assets for the year ended December 31, 2024, was a gain of 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, was a gain of 15% and for the year ended December 31, 2022, was a loss of 20%. For 2025, we expect to assume a rate of return of 6.65%. Our pension plan assets are valued at fair value as of the measurement date
.

For additional information regarding our pension and other postretirement benefits (see Note 18 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Income Taxes 
We file a consolidated federal income tax return. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in governing law or review by taxing authorities.

We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we are not able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would increase the provision for income taxes.

The tax effect of a change in tax law or rates included in income tax expense from continuing operations includes effect of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities initially recognized through a charge or credit to other comprehensive income. The residual tax effects typically are released when the item giving rise to the tax effect is disposed of, liquidated, or terminated. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For additional information regarding FASB Accounting Standards Updates (‘‘ASU’’s) that have been issued but not yet adopted and that may impact the Company, refer to Note 3 – ‘‘Recent Accounting Pronouncements’’ to the audited consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this annual Report on form 10-K

Item 7A. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities, including those associated with our pension plan assets. Market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks, and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business. Our primary market risk exposures from interest rate risk and equity price risk are as follows:

Interest Rate Exposure
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest-bearing portion of our pension investment portfolio and the related actuarial liability for pension obligations, as well as our floating rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2024, 91% of our total debt had fixed interest rates. We had no interest rate swap agreements in effect at December 31, 2024. We believe that our currently outstanding obligation exposure to interest rate changes is minimal.

Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, only our $1.0 billion term loan facility has a floating rate at December 31, 2024. The annual impact of 100 basis points increase in the SOFR would result in approximately $10 million of additional interest expense, provided that the SOFR rate exceeds the SOFR floor. An adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable rate obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure, a near-term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Our discount rate assumption for our pension benefit obligation is determined at least annually, or whenever required, with assistance from our actuaries. The discount rate is based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long-term, high quality corporate bonds with durations approximate to that of our benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the discount rate utilized in calculating our benefit plan obligation was 5.60% and 5.20%, respectively. 

The discount rate assumption for our OPEB obligation is determined in a similar manner to the pension plan. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, our discount rate utilized in calculating our benefit plan obligation was 5.70% and 5.20%, respectively.

At December 31, 2024, the fair value of our debt was estimated to be approximately $11.7 billion, based on quoted market prices, our overall weighted average borrowing rate was 6.996% and our overall weighted average maturity was approximately 4.5 years, which decreased from approximately 5.5 years as of December 31, 2023. 

Equity Price Exposure
Our exposure to market risks for changes in equity security prices as of December 31, 2024 is primarily limited to our pension plan assets. We have no other security investments of any significant amount.

The value of our pension plan assets increased $60 million from $2,268 million at December 31, 2023 to $2,328 million at December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily a result of changes in the market value of investments of $114 million, net of plan expenses, and contributions of $133 million, offset by benefit payments of $187 million.

Management’s Report On Intern
al Control Over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
Frontier Communications Parent, Inc.:

The management of Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. and subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this report and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
‎
Frontier Communications Parent, Inc.:

Opinion on the

Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Evaluation of Revenue

As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had $5.9 billion in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.

We identified the evaluation of certain revenue streams as a critical audit matter. Obtaining an understanding of processes, systems and databases used in the Company’s revenue recognition process involved especially challenging auditor judgment and required specialized knowledge related to IT applications. Specifically, evaluating the processes and the related internal controls for revenue streams associated with data and internet services, voice services and video services, including the related IT applications, configurations and interfaces, required significant auditor effort.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over data and internet services, voice services and video services revenue. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the evaluation of revenue, including general IT controls and IT application controls. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in testing certain IT applications that are used by the Company in its revenue recognition process. We performed a software-assisted data analysis to test relationships among certain revenue transactions.  Additionally, we tested the deferred revenue balance related to advanced billings as of December 31, 2024. We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence.

/s/ KPMG LLP

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1936.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
‎
Frontier Communications Parent, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on 
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
 In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated 
balance sheets
 of the Company as of December 31, 2024 
and 
2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity, and cash flows for 
each of the years in the three-year period ended 
December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated 
February 20, 2025

expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management's Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
 Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1) 
Description of Bu
siness and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
: 

(a)
Description of Business
:
Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. is a provider of communications services in the United States, with approximately 
3.1
 million broadband subscribers and approximately 
13,000
 employees, operating in 
25
 states. We were incorporated in 1935, originally under the name of Citizens Utilities Company and was known as Citizens Communications Company until July 31, 2008. Frontier and its subsidiaries are referred to as “we,” “us,” “our,” “Frontier,” or the “Company” in this report.

(b)
Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates
:
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Frontier Communications Parent, Inc., all consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

For our financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2024, we evaluated subsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through the date that we filed this Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and (iii) the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Estimates and judgments are used when accounting for the application of allowance for credit losses, asset impairments, indefinite-lived intangibles, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, and pension and other postretirement benefits, among others. 

(c)  
Going Concern
:
In accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (ASU 2014-15)”, and ASC 205, “Presentation of Financial Statements”, we have the responsibility to evaluate at each reporting period, including interim periods, whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to meet its future financial obligations. In its evaluation for this report, management considered our current financial condition and liquidity sources, including current funds available, forecasted future cash flows and our conditional and unconditional obligations due within one year following the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course business.

(d)
Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:
We consider all liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Restricted cash amounts represent cash collateral required for certain Letter of Credit obligations and utility vendors and collateral for debt arrangements.

At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $
161
 million and $
114
 million, respectively, in restricted cash, and is included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheet. Pursuant to the terms of the Company’s securitized financing facility and secured fiber network revenue term notes, as described in Note 8, restricted cash is held in securitization escrow accounts. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023 approximately $
56
 million and $
42
 million, respectively, is current restricted cash, included in “Income taxes and other current assets” on our consolidated balance sheet, held for the purpose of paying interest and certain fees. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, and 2023 approximately $
105
 million and $
72
 million, respectively, is noncurrent restricted cash held for the purpose of satisfying the required liquidity reserve amount.

(e)   
Short-Term Investments:
Given the long-term nature of our fiber build, we have invested cash into short-term investments to improve interest income while preserving funding flexibility. 

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had no short-term investments. 
As of December 31, 2023, the Company had short-term investments of $
1,075
 million.

F-
10

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Other Investments
In connection with the closing of the securitization transaction, approximately $
63
 million in the form of U.S. Treasuries was deposited in an escrow account established with a trustee, for the purpose of paying interest and principal on $
47
 million in remaining debt of our subsidiary Frontier Southwest Incorporated. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, this balance was approximately $
57
 million and $
62
 million, respectively, and is included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11 for further details.

(f)
Revenue Recognition
: 
Revenue for data and Internet services, voice services, video services and switched and non-switched access services is recognized as services are provided to customers. Services that are billed in advance include monthly recurring network access services (including data services), special access services, and monthly recurring voice, video, and related charges. Revenue is recognized by measuring progress toward the complete satisfaction of our performance obligations. The unearned portion of these fees is deferred as a component of “Advanced billings” on our consolidated balance sheet and recognized as revenue over the period that the services are provided. Services that are billed in arrears include non-recurring network access services (including data services), switched access services, and non-recurring voice and video services. The earned but unbilled portion of these fees is recognized as revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and accrued in “Accounts receivable” on our consolidated balance sheet in the period that services are provided. Excise taxes are recognized as a liability when billed.

Satisfaction of Performance Obligations
We satisfy our obligations to customers by transferring goods and services in exchange for consideration received from the customer. The timing of our satisfaction of the performance obligation may differ from the timing of the customer’s payment.

Bundled Service and Allocation of Discounts
When customers purchase more than one service, revenue for each is determined by allocating the total transaction price based upon the relative stand-alone selling price of each service. We frequently offer service discounts as an incentive to customers, which reduce the total transaction price. Any incentives which are considered cash equivalents (e.g. gift cards) that are granted will similarly result in a reduction of the total transaction price. Cash equivalent incentives are accounted for on a portfolio basis and are recognized in the month they are awarded to customers.

Customer Incentives
In the process of acquiring and/or retaining customers, we may issue a variety of incentives aside from service discounts or cash equivalent incentives. Those incentives that have stand-alone value (e.g. gift cards not considered cash equivalents or free goods/services) are considered separate performance obligations. While these incentives are free to the customer, a portion of the consideration received from the customer is ascribed to them based upon their relative stand-alone selling price. These types of incentives are accounted for on a portfolio basis with both revenue and expense recognized in the month they are awarded to the customer. The earned revenue associated with these incentives is reflected in “Other” revenue while the associated costs are reflected in “Cost of Services”.

Upfront Fees
All non-refundable upfront fees assessed to our customers provide them with a material right to renew; therefore, they are deferred by creating a contract liability and amortized into “Data and Internet service revenue” for fees charged to our wholesale customers and “Other revenue” for fees charged to all other customers over the average customer life using a portfolio approach.

Customer Acquisition Costs
Sales commission expenses are recognized as incurred. According to ASC 606, incremental costs in obtaining a contract with a customer are deferred and recorded as a contract asset if the period of benefit is expected to be greater than one year. For our retail customers, this period of benefit has been determined to be less than one year. As such, we applied the practical expedient that allows such costs to be expensed as incurred.

Taxes, Surcharges and Subsidies
We collect various taxes, Universal Service Funds (USF) surcharges (primarily federal USF), and certain other surcharges from our customers and subsequently remits these taxes to governmental authorities. 

In June 2015, we accepted the FCC offer of support to price cap carriers under the Connect America Fund (“CAF”) Phase II program, which was intended to provide long-term support for broadband build commitments in high cost unserved or underserved areas. The 
seven
-year funding term ended on December 31, 2021. The Universal Service Administrative Company (“USAC”) and the FCC are reviewing carriers’ CAF II program completion data, and if USAC or the FCC 

F-
11

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

determines that we did not satisfy certain applicable CAF Phase II requirements, we could be required to return a portion of the funds previously received and may be subject to certain other penalties, requirements and obligations.

In May 2022, we accepted the FCC offer under the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”) Phase I program, which provides funding over a 
ten
-year period to support the construction of broadband networks in rural communities across the country. We accepted $
37
 million in annual support through 2032 in return for our commitment to make broadband available to households within the RDOF eligible areas. We will recognize the FCC’s RDOF Phase I subsidies into revenue on a straight-line basis over the ten-year funding term which will end March 31, 2032. We are required to complete the RDOF deployment by December 31, 2028. Thereafter, USAC and the FCC will review carriers’ RDOF program completion data, and if USAC or the FCC determines that we did not satisfy applicable FCC RDOF requirements, funding provided to us can be discontinued and we could be required to return a portion of the funds previously received and may be subject to certain other penalties, requirements and obligations. Fines and penalties could also be assessed to the extent Frontier were ever to decide to surrender RDOF locations previously awarded. We accrue for any potential shortfall in the household build commitment that we deem to be probable and reasonably estimated.

On July 24, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that certain delegations of authority in the USF contribution system are unconstitutional. The court remanded the case to the FCC. The Fifth Circuit subsequently stayed the decision to allow the FCC to file a petition with, the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review. The stay allows for the continued collection of USF contributions while the Supreme Court considers the case. The precise impact of the case is unclear at this time, including the extent to which the decision applies to parties other than the petitioner.  We cannot predict how this or future court decisions will impact the company’s ability to receive federal universal service funds in the future.

(g)
Property, Plant and Equipment
:
Property, plant and equipment are stated at original cost, including capitalized interest. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. The gross book value of routine property, plant and equipment retired is charged against accumulated depreciation.

(h)
Definite and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets:
Intangible assets are initially recorded at estimated fair value. Customer relationship intangibles were established for business and wholesale customers. These intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over their assigned useful lives of between 
11
 and 
16
 years. Additionally, trademark and tradename assets established are amortized on a straight-line basis over 
5
 years. We review such intangible assets annually, or more often if indicators of impairment arise, to determine whether there is evidence that indicates an impairment condition may exist that would necessitate a change in useful life and a different amortization period
.

(i)
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of:
We review long-lived assets to be held and used, including customer lists and property, plant and equipment, and long-lived assets to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair market value. If any assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value. Also, we periodically reassess the useful lives of our long-lived assets to determine whether any changes are required.

(j)
Lease Accounting:
We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and Finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating and finance lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms used in accounting for leases may reflect options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ROU assets for operating leases are recorded to “Other Assets”, and the related liabilities recorded to “Other current liabilities”, and “Other liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets. Assets subject to finance leases are included in “Property, Plant & Equipment”, with corresponding liabilities recorded to “Other current liabilities”, and “Other liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets. 

F-
12

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

We assess potential impairments to our leases annually, or as indicators exist, if indicators of impairment arise to determine whether there is evidence that indicate an impairment condition may exist. We continue to review our real estate portfolio and, during the first quarter of 2022, determined to either terminate or market for sublease certain facilities leases, which triggered an impairment of $
44
 million for our finance and operating lease assets recorded as restructuring charges and other costs. See Note 10 for further details.

(k)
Income Taxes and Deferred Income Taxes:

We file a consolidated federal income tax return. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we are not able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would increase the provision for income taxes.

The tax effect of a change in tax law or rates included in income tax expense from continuing operations includes effect of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities initially recognized through a charge or credit to other comprehensive income (loss). The residual tax effects typically are released when the item giving rise to the tax effect is disposed of, liquidated, or terminated. 

(l)    
Stock Plans:
We have 
one
 stock-based compensation plan under which grants are made and awards remain outstanding. Awards under this plan may be made to employees, directors or consultants of the Company or its affiliates, as determined by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the Board. Awards may be made in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units, incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights or other stock-based awards, including awards with performance, market, and time-vesting conditions.

The compensation cost recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest. GAAP requires forfeitures to be estimated and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

(2)  
Merger Agreement
:

On September 4, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Verizon Communications Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Verizon”), and France Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by law) of specified conditions, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon.

Subject to such terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the Board, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of common stock, par value $
0.01
 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement) shall be converted into the right to receive $
38.50
 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).

At the Effective Time, other than as set forth below, each outstanding RSU (as defined below) and PSU (as defined below) will vest and be canceled and the holder thereof will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such award (in the case of PSUs, based on attainment of all applicable performance goals at the greater of target and actual level of performance measured at the Effective Time) multiplied by the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, a portion of the outstanding RSUs and PSUs granted following the date of the Merger Agreement (determined by proration of any such grant based on the time remaining between the Effective Time and the end of the relevant vesting period) shall be automatically converted into a number of unvested restricted stock units of Verizon (“Verizon RSUs”) equal to the number of such RSUs and PSUs multiplied by an exchange ratio equal to the Merger Consideration divided by the five day volume weighted average price of Verizon common stock ending with the second complete trading day immediately prior to the closing date. Such conversion of PSUs shall be based on attainment of all applicable performance goals at the greater of target and actual level of performance measured at the Effective Time. The Verizon RSUs shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the RSUs and PSUs of the Company (including time-based vesting conditions but excluding performance-based vesting conditions) prior to the Effective Time.

The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among other things: (i) the approval of the holders of a majority of the voting power represented by the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote thereon (the “Company Stockholder Approval”); (ii) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR waiting period”); (iii) the receipt of certain required consents or approvals from the FCC and certain specified state regulatory authorities; (iv) the absence of legal restraints prohibiting the Merger; and (v) other customary conditions specified in the Merger Agreement. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition. The Company Stockholder Approval was obtained on November 13, 2024 and the applicable HSR waiting period expired on February 14, 2025. Subject to the remaining conditions, the Company expects to consummate the merger by the first quarter of 2026.

The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for the Company and Verizon, including, among others, the right of either party to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated by March 4, 2026 (subject to two automatic three-month extensions if certain closing conditions have not been satisfied).

Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, the Company will be required to pay Verizon a termination fee equal to $
320
 million. Additionally, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances relating to the failure to obtain certain specified antitrust or other regulatory approvals, Verizon will be required to pay the Company a termination fee equal to $
590
 million.

The Company has incurred and will incur certain costs relating to the proposed Merger, such as financial advisory, legal, accounting and other professional services fees.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
: 

Financial Accounting Standards Adopted During 2024

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we adopted, the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to reportable segment disclosures. The amendments in this update improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses. Currently, Topic 280 requires that a public entity disclose certain information about its reportable segments. For example, a public entity is required to report a measure of segment profit or loss that 
our chief operating decision maker (“
CODM”) uses to assess segment performance and make decisions about allocating resources. Topic 280 also requires other specified segment items and amounts, such as depreciation, amortization, and depletion expense, to be disclosed under certain circumstances. The amendments in this update do not change or remove those disclosure requirements. The amendments in this update also do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments.
 Refer to Note 17 for further details.

Financial Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 

ASU No. 2024-03 – Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Expense Disaggregation Disclosures. This update requires public business entities to provide detailed disclosures in the notes to financial statements, disaggregating specific expense categories within relevant income statement captions. The required categories include purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depletion. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

ASU No. 2023-09 – Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this Update require that public business entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income [or loss] by the applicable statutory income tax rate). For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.
  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Revenue Recognition:

We categorize our products, services, and other revenues into the following categories:

Data and Internet services
 include broadband services for consumer and business customers. We provide data transmission services to high volume business customers and other carriers with dedicated high capacity circuits (“nonswitched access”) including services to wireless providers (“wireless backhaul”);

Voice services
 include traditional local and long-distance wireline services, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, as well as a number of unified messaging services offered to our consumer and business customers. Voice services also include the long-distance voice origination and termination services that we provide to our business customers and other carriers;

Video services
 include revenues generated from services provided directly to consumer customers as linear terrestrial television services, through various satellite providers, and through partnerships with over-the-top (OTT) video providers. Video services also includes pay-per-view revenues, video on demand, equipment rentals, and video advertising. We have made the strategic decision to limit sales of new traditional TV services focusing on our broadband products and OTT video options;

Other customer revenue
 includes switched access revenue, rents collected for collocation services, and revenue from other services and fees. Switched access revenue includes revenues derived from allowing other carriers to use our network to originate and/or terminate their local and long-distance voice traffic (switched access). These services are primarily billed on a minutes-of-use basis applying tariffed rates filed with the FCC or state agencies; and

Subsidy and other regulatory revenue
 includes revenues generated from cost subsidies from state and federal authorities, including the CAF II and RDOF.

The unsatisfied obligations for retail customers consist of amounts in advance billings, which are expected to be earned within the following monthly billing cycle. Unsatisfied obligations for wholesale customers are based on a point-in-time calculation and determined by the number of circuits provided and the contractual price. These wholesale customer obligations change from period to period based on new circuits added as well as circuits that are terminated.

We maintain an allowance for credit losses based on the estimated ability to collect accounts receivable. The allowance for credit losses is increased by recording an expense for the provision for bad debts for retail customers, and through decreases to revenue at the time of billing for wholesale customers. The allowance is decreased when customer accounts are written off, or when customers are given credits.

The provision for bad debts charged to expense was $
39
 million, $
35
 million and $
26
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Approximately $
440
 million and $
143
 million of credits related to customers are included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.

In accordance with ASC 326, we performed calculations to estimate expected credit losses, utilizing rates that are consistent with our write offs (net of recoveries) because such events affect the entity’s loss given default experience.

Property, plant, and equipment includes approximately $
246
 million and $
179
 million of fixed assets recognized under finance leases as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024, our materials and supplies were $
431
 million, as compared to $
594
 million as of December 31, 2023. 
Components of this include fiber, network electronics, and customer premises equipment.

Beginning in the second half of 2023, Frontier negotiated payment terms with certain of our vendors, (referred to as vendor financing), which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities on the statement of cash flows. As of December 31, 2024, our capital expenditures were $
2,783
 million. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our vendor financing payments were $
463
 million. As of December 31, 2024, there was $
585
 million, $
8
 million, and $
24
 million in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities”, “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities”, respectively, for payables associated with capital expenditures, and $
16
 million included in “Other current liabilities” for vendor financing payables associated with capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we had capitalized interest of $
49
 million.

In 2024, 
we sold certain properties consisting of land and buildings for approximately
 $
18
 million. 
The aggregate carrying value of the properties was approximately $
11
 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $
7
 million.

In 2023, we had asset sales and transactions of $
63
 million, including approximately $
47
 million in net proceeds related to certain wireless towers. Approximately $
19
 million of the proceeds related to wireless towers that qualified as sales, included in investing cash flows, and the remaining $
28
 million in proceeds related to wireless towers that were subject to sale-leaseback agreements and included in financing cash flows. After taking these sales and transactions into account, along with our capital expenditures, our net capital activity was $
3,148
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

During 2022, we sold a property that was subject to leaseback, generating approximately $
70
 million in proceeds. 

Depreciation expense is principally based on the composite group method. Depreciation expense was as follows:

Credit Facilities and Term Loans

Revolving Facility 
Subject to customary exceptions and thresholds, the security package under the Revolving Facility includes pledges of the equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries, which is currently limited to certain specified pledged entities and substantially all personal property of Frontier Video, which same assets also secure our First Lien Notes. The Revolving Facility is guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee the First Lien Notes. After giving effect to approximately $
265
 million of letters of credit outstanding, we had $
660
 million of available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2024.

The Revolving Facility includes customary negative covenants for loan agreements of this type, including covenants limiting Frontier and our restricted subsidiaries’ (other than certain covenants therein which are limited to subsidiary guarantors) ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions and make payments in respect of certain material payment subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for loan agreements of this type.

The Revolving Facility also includes certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants, and events of default, including, but not limited to, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, certain events under ERISA, change of control or damage to a material portion of the collateral.

On May 22, 2024, Frontier Communications Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Frontier (“Frontier Holdings”), entered into an amendment (the “2024 Credit Agreement Amendment”) to its existing credit agreement that governs its Revolving Facility which, among other things, (i) increased the aggregate amount of certain additional obligations permitted to be outstanding, including first lien debt, and securitization and receivables facilities, and non-loan party debt, from $
2,500
 million to $
5,500
 million; provided that at least 
40
% of the net available cash from the first $
1,915
 million in securitization and receivables facilities received after May 22, 2024 (excluding net available cash received from drawings with respect to $
500
 million of commitments of variable funding notes) is applied to prepay the Borrower’s existing term loans and other applicable indebtedness, and 
100
% of the net available cash from securitization and receivables facilities in excess thereof (up to the cap of $
5,500
 million) shall be applied to prepay the Borrower’s existing term loans and other applicable indebtedness; (ii) limited future securitizations and receivables facilities to assets located in Texas and/or Florida; and (iii) amended the financial maintenance covenant for the benefit of the Revolving Facility by, commencing with the period ending June 30, 2024, (a) including outstanding securitization and receivables facilities in the calculation of indebtedness and (b) increasing the maximum financial maintenance covenant leverage ratio thereunder to 
5.25
:1.00, with a step-down to 
4.75
:1.00 commencing with the period ending March 31, 2027, and continuing thereafter. The 2024 Credit Agreement Amendment became effective on July 1, 2024, when $
402
 million of net available cash from the securitization closing on such date was applied to prepay existing term loans.

On July 30, 2024, Frontier Holdings entered into a further amendment to its existing credit agreement that governs its Revolving Facility, pursuant to which $
50
 million of revolving credit commitments of a terminating lender were replaced by $
75
 million of commitments from a new lender, increasing overall capacity from $
900
 million to $
925
 million. 
The maturity date of the Revolving Facility will be the earliest of (a) April 30, 2028, (b) 91 days prior to the maturity of the term loan facility, (c) unless such notes have been repaid and/or redeemed in full, the date that is 91 days prior to the stated maturity date of our 5.875% First Lien Notes due 2027, and (d) unless such notes have been repaid and/or redeemed in full, the date that is 91 days prior to the stated maturity date of our 5.000% First Lien Notes due 2028.

Term Loan Facility
On January 14, 2025, Frontier Holdings entered into an amendment to its existing Term Loan Facility, which, among other things, (x) further lowered the margin over adjusted Term SOFR with respect to the Term Loan from 
3.50
% to 
2.50
% and (y) further lowered the margin over the alternative base rate with respect to the Term loan from 
2.50
% to 
1.50
%. On July 1, 2024, Frontier Holdings entered into an amendment to the Term Loan Facility which, among other things, extended the maturity date of $
1.025
 billion of the Term Loan to July 1, 2031 and eliminated the credit spread adjustment previously applicable to the Term Loan.

Subject to certain exceptions and thresholds, the security package under the Term Loan Facility includes pledges of the equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries, which as of the issue date is limited to certain specified pledged entities and substantially all personal property of Frontier Video Services Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Frontier Video”), which same assets also secure the First Lien Notes (as defined below). The Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee the First Lien Notes.

The Term Loan Facility also includes certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, including, but not limited to, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, certain events under ERISA, upon the conversion date, unstayed judgments in favor of a third-party involving an aggregate liability in excess of a certain threshold, change of control, upon the conversion date, specified governmental actions having a material adverse effect or condemnation or damage to a material portion of the collateral.

Warehouse Facilities

On December 31, 2024 (the “Warehouse Effective Date”), Frontier Tampa Bay FL Fiber 1 LLC (the “Borrower”) and Frontier SPE FL Guarantor LLC, as guarantor (the “Warehouse Guarantor”), each a subsidiary of Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. (the “Parent”), entered into a credit agreement (the “Warehouse Credit Agreement”) with certain lenders that establishes and governs certain credit facilities (the “Warehouse Facilities”). The Warehouse Facilities include:


A delayed draw term loan facility (the “DDTL Facility”) of $
1.5
 billion, less commitments reserved for letters of credit (the “Maximum DDTL Amount”). The DDTL Facility is available from the Warehouse Effective Date until the earlier of the full draw of the Maximum DDTL Amount or the third anniversary of the Warehouse Effective Date (such earlier date, the “DDTL Commitment Expiration Date”). To draw amounts under the DDTL Facility, the Borrower must comply with a total leverage ratio of no more than 
6.75
:1.00 and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 
2.00
:1.00. Additionally, no defaults or other specified conditions may be continuing, and all conditions precedent for each extension of credit must be satisfied. The Borrower must repay all outstanding amounts under the DDTL Facility due on the fifth anniversary of the Warehouse Effective Date. The interest rate for the DDTL Facility is either, at the sole discretion of the Warehouse Borrower, for Base Rate Loans, (a) the highest of (i) the “U.S. Prime Lending Rate” published by the Wall Street Journal, (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as agreed to in good faith by the parties to the Warehouse Credit Agreement) plus 
0.50
%, and (iii) one-month Term SOFR plus 
1.00
% per annum, plus (b) 
0.75
%, with step-ups from and after the third anniversary, or, for SOFR Loans, Term SOFR plus 
1.75
%, with step-ups from and after the third anniversary. Optional prepayments are allowed without fees or penalties, subject to notice requirements. A portion of the DDTL Facility, up to $
200
 million, is reserved as a letter of credit sublimit.

If Frontier Issuer has not repaid or refinanced any Class of Notes of a Series of Fiber Term Notes prior to the ARD, additional interest will accrue thereon in an amount equal to the greater of (i) 
5.00
% per annum and (ii) the excess amount, if any, by which the sum of the following exceeds the interest rate for such note: (A) the yield to maturity (adjusted to a “mortgage-equivalent basis” pursuant to the standards and practices of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association) on the ARD for such note of the United States Treasury Security having a remaining term closest to 
10
 years plus (B) 
5.00
% plus (C) the post-ARD note spread applicable to such Note.

While the Fiber Term Notes are outstanding, scheduled payments of interest are required to be made on the Notes on a monthly basis. From and after the ARD, principal payments will also be required to be made on the Notes on a monthly basis. No principal payments will be due on the Fiber Term Notes prior to the ARD, unless certain rapid amortization or acceleration triggers are activated.

The Fiber Term Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type. These covenants and restrictions include (i) that Frontier Issuer maintains a liquidity reserve account to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments, including specified make-whole payments in the case of certain optional prepayments of the Fiber Term Notes prior to the monthly payment date in July 2026, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, that  the transfers of the assets pledged as collateral for the Fiber Term Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. As provided in the Base Indenture, the Fiber Term Notes are also subject to rapid amortization in the event of a failure to maintain a stated debt service coverage ratio. A rapid amortization may be cured if the debt service coverage ratio exceeds a certain threshold for a certain period of time, upon which cure, regular amortization, if any, will resume. The Fiber Term Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Fiber Term Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective and certain judgments.

Other Obligations
During 2018, we contributed real estate properties with an aggregate fair value of $
37
 million for the purpose of funding a portion of our contribution obligations to our qualified defined benefit pension plan.
 The pension plan obtained independent appraisals of the property and, based on these appraisals, the pension plan recorded the contributions at aggregate fair value of $
37
 million for 2019. We entered into a lease for the contributed properties. The properties are managed on behalf of the pension plan by an independent fiduciary, and the terms of the lease were negotiated with the fiduciary on an arm’s-length basis.

For properties contributed in 2018, leases have initial terms of 
20
 years at a combined average aggregate annual rent of approximately $
5
 million. 

The contribution and leaseback of the properties were treated as financing transactions and, accordingly, we continue to depreciate the carrying value of the property in our financial statements and 
no
 gain or loss was recognized. An obligation of $
52
 million is included in our consolidated balance sheet within “Other liabilities” as of December 31, 2024 and the liability is reduced annually by a portion of the lease payments made to the pension plan. Under the new lease standard, liabilities for these finance transactions are included in our financing lease liabilities. Refer to Note 10 for additional details.

We are the lessor for operating leases of towers, datacenters, corporate offices, and certain equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of

 year to

 years, some of which include options to extend the leases, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 
1
 year. None of these leases include options for our lessees to purchase the underlying asset.

A significant number of our service contracts with our customers include equipment rentals. We have elected to apply the practical expedient to account for those associated equipment rentals and services as a single, combined component. We have evaluated the service component to be ‘predominant’ in these contracts and have accounted for the combined component as a single performance obligation under ASC 606.

We, as a lessor, recognized revenue of $

During 2024, Frontier remeasured its pension plan and postretirement benefit plan obligations, resulting in remeasurement loss of 
$
45
 million 
and a remeasurement gain of 
$
35
 million
, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024. The 

F-
29

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

pension remeasurement loss was primarily a result of the demographic updates, interest rate related assumptions and the actual return on assets, offset by the discount rate change. The OPEB remeasurement gain was primarily a result of the discount rate change.  Refer to Note 18 for further details.

During 2023, we amended the medical coverage for certain postretirement benefit plans, which resulted in remeasurement loses of $
3
 million, primarily due to discount rate changes. For the pension plan, we had a remeasurement gain of $
202
 million, primarily due to strong investment performance during 2023.

During 2022, we recorded an actuarial gain of $
248
 million as a result of remeasurements due to amendments in the medical coverage for certain postretirement benefit plans, discount rate changes, as well as regular period end remeasurements. As a result of pension settlement charges incurred during 2023, we had a remeasurement gain of $
218

Stock Plans
: 

Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. has one active long-term incentive plan, the 2024 Management Incentive Plan (the “2024 Incentive Plan”), under which grants are made and awards remain outstanding.  The plan was approved by shareholders at the Annual Meeting on May 15, 2024, with 
8,765,000
 shares available for awards. The 2024 Incentive Plan permits stock-based awards to be made to employees, directors, or consultants of the Company or its affiliates, as determined by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the Board. Available shares under the previous plan of 
1,151,334
 were rolled into the new 2024 plan for a total of 
9,916,334
 shares reserved for issuance. Equity awards have been issued in the form of time-based restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based stock units (PSUs). As of December 31, 2024, there were 
10,130,566
 shares available to grant.

In connection with the Merger, our Named Executive Officers (“NEOs”) may become entitled to payments and benefits that may be treated as “excess parachute payments”. To mitigate the potential impact of certain applicable tax provisions on the Company and certain NEOs, on December 19, 2024, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Committee approved the acceleration into December 2024 of the vesting and payments of target annual cash incentive bonuses, time-based RSUs and PSUs that would otherwise have been payable to the NEOs in the ordinary course in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. These actions are intended to benefit the Company by preserving compensation-related corporate income tax deductions for the Company that otherwise might be disallowed by such tax provisions and to mitigate or eliminate the amount of excise tax that may be payable by the NEOs pursuant to such tax provisions.

For purposes of determining compensation expense, the fair value of each restricted stock grant is estimated based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The non-vested restricted stock units granted in 2022, 2023, and 2024 generally vest, and are expensed, on a ratable basis over 
three years
 from the grant date of the award. Total remaining unrecognized compensation cost associated with unvested restricted stock awards that is deferred at December 31, 2024 was $
33
 million and the weighted average vesting period over which this cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 
2
 years.

None of the restricted stock awards may be sold, assigned, pledged, or otherwise transferred, voluntarily or involuntarily, by the employees until the restrictions lapse, subject to limited exceptions. The restrictions are time-based. Compensation expense, recognized in “Selling, general, and administrative expenses”, of $

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, has been recorded in connection with restricted stock.

Performance Stock Units 
We currently have outstanding performance stock units (“PSU”) that were granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024. Under these awards, a target number of PSUs are granted to each participant with respect to a 
three
-year performance period (“The Measurement Period”). For the 2024 PSU awards, for example, the Measurement Period is from January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2026.

The performance metrics under the 2024 PSU awards consist of (1) Adjusted Fiber EBITDA, (2) Fiber Revenue and (3) Relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”).  Relative TSR is based on our total return to stockholders over the Measurement Period relative to the S&P 400 Mid Cap Index. Each performance metric is weighted 
33.3
%, the goals for the relative TSR metric have been fully set.

The performance metrics under the 2022 and 2023 PSU awards are (1) Adjusted Fiber EBITDA, (2) Fiber Locations Constructed and (3) Expansion Fiber Penetration with an overall relative TSR modifier. Each performance metric is weighted 
33.3
% and goals for each metric have been set for the full Measurement Period.

Achievement of the metrics for outstanding PSUs will be measured separately, and the number of awards earned will be determined based on actual performance relative to the targets of each performance metric. Achievement is measured on a cumulative basis for each performance metric individually at the end of the 
three
-year Measurement Period with a TSR modifier for the 2022 and 2023 plans. The payout of the 2022, 2023 and 2024 PSUs can range from 
0
% to a maximum award payout of 
200
% of the target units. 

The number of PSUs earned at the end of the Measurement Period may be more or less than the number of target PSUs granted as a result of performance. An executive must maintain a satisfactory performance rating during the Measurement Period and, except for limited circumstances, must be employed by Frontier on the determination date in order for the award to vest. The Compensation and Human Capital Committee will determine the number of shares earned for the Measurement Period in the first quarter of the year following the end of the Measurement Period. PSUs awards, to the extent earned, will be paid out in the form of common stock on a 
one
-for-one basis.

Under ASC 718, Stock Based Compensation Expense, a grant date, and the fair value of a performance award are determined once the targets are finalized. For the 2022 and 2023 PSU awards, targets for all of the metrics have been fully set for each performance period and the related expense will be amortized over the appropriate performance period. For the 2024 PSU awards, the targets related to two of the three performance metrics have not been set. As a result, as of December 31, 2024, we have recognized associated expense with respect to 
1/3
 of the aggregate outstanding 2024 PSU awards.

The performance metrics under the 2024 PSU plan consist of (1) Adjusted Fiber EBITDA, (2) Fiber Revenue and (3) Relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”).  Relative TSR is based on our total return to stockholders over the Measurement Period relative to the S&P 400 Mid Cap Index. The metrics under the 2022 and 2023 plans are (1) Adjusted Fiber EBITDA, (2) Fiber Locations Constructed and (3) Expansion Fiber Penetration with an overall relative TSR modifier. For 2022 and 2023 outstanding plans, each performance metric is weighted 
33.3
% and goals for each metric have been set for the full Measurement Period. For the 2024 outstanding plan, each performance metric is weighted 
33.3
%, the goals for the relative TSR metric have been fully set, and the goals for the remaining metrics have been set for the first portion of the Measurement Period.  Achievement of the metrics will be measured separately, and the number of awards earned will be determined based on actual performance relative to the targets of each performance metric. Achievement is measured on a cumulative basis for each performance metric individually at the end of the three-year Measurement Period with a TSR modifier for the 2022 and 2023 plans. The payout of the 2022, 2023 and 2024 PSUs can range from 
0
% to a maximum award payout of 
200
% of the target units. 2021 PSU awards paid out at 
126
% of target on March 1, 2024.

Our federal research and development credit as of December 31, 2024, is estimated at $
14
 million. The federal research and development credit will begin to expire after 
2041
, unless otherwise used.

Our various state credits as of December 31, 2024, are estimated at $
48
 million. The state credits will begin to expire after 
2024
, unless otherwise used.

We considered positive and negative evidence in regard to evaluating certain deferred tax assets during 2024, including the development of recent years of pre-tax book losses. On the basis of this evaluation, a valuation allowance of $
308
 million tax effected ($
243
 million net of federal benefit) was recorded as of December 31, 2024.

This valuation allowance is related to state net operating losses, state tax credits, and the state impact from the federal limitation on interest expense deduction. In evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management also considered the projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities in making this assessment. Based upon this assessment, management believes it is more likely than not we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of valuation allowance
.

The provision (benefit) for federal and state income taxes, as well as the taxes charged or credited to equity of Frontier, includes amounts both payable currently and deferred for payment in future periods as indicated below

U.S. GAAP requires applying a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions either taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns. The total amount of our gross tax liability for tax positions that may not be sustained under a “more likely than not” threshold amounts to $
7
 million as of December 31, 2024, including immaterial interest. 
The amount of our uncertain tax positions, for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the next twelve months, would not have a material impact on our effective tax rate

as of December 31, 2024.

Our policy regarding the classification of interest and penalties is to include these amounts as a component of income tax expense. This treatment of interest and penalties is consistent with prior periods. We are subject to income tax examinations generally for the years 2019 forward for federal and 2016 forward for state filing jurisdictions. We also maintain uncertain tax positions in various state jurisdictions.

1,255,000
 and PSUs including those converted to performance-based restricted stock of approximately 
326,000
, respectively have been excluded.

In calculating diluted net income per common share for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, the effect of certain PSUs is excluded from the computation as the respective performance metrics have not been satisfied.

Retirement Plans
:

We sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of our former and current employees and other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical, dental, life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents. The pension plan and postretirement benefit plans are closed to the majority of our newly hired employees. The benefits are based on years of service and final average pay or career average pay. Contributions are made in amounts sufficient to meet ERISA funding requirements while considering tax deductibility. Plan assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed-income securities and alternative investments.

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The accounting results for pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts. These actuarial assumptions include the following: discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover, healthcare cost trend rates, expected retirement age, optional form of benefit and mortality. We review these assumptions for changes on an interim and annual basis with our independent actuaries. We consider our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to be our most critical assumptions.

The discount rate is used to value, on a present value basis, our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date. The same rate is also used in the interest cost component of the pension and postretirement benefit cost determination for the following year. The measurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date. Our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our independent actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long-term, high quality corporate bonds that approximate the benefit obligation.

As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we utilized an estimation technique that is based upon a settlement model (Bond:Link) that permits us to closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants. This rate can change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields.

As a result of the technique described above, we are utilizing a discount rate of 
5.60
% as of December 31, 2024 for our qualified pension plan, compared to rates of 
5.20
% and 
5.50
% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The discount rate for postretirement plans as of December 31, 2024 
was 
5.70
% compared to 
5.20
% in 2023 and 
5.50
% in 2022.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied in the determination of periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the expense. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we considered published surveys of expected market returns, 10 and 20 year actual returns of various major indices, and our own historical 5 year, 10 year and 20 year investment returns. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 
65
% in long-duration fixed income securities, and 
35
% in equity securities and other investments. We review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate. Our pension asset investment allocation decisions are made by the Retirement Investment & Administration Committee (RIAC), a committee comprised of members of management, pursuant to a delegation of authority by the Board of Directors. Asset allocation decisions take into account expected market return assumptions of various asset classes as well as expected pension benefit payment streams. When analyzing anticipated benefit payments, management considers both the absolute amount of the payments as well as the timing of such payments. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 
7.50
% in 2023 and 2022. For the period January 1, 2024 – September 30, 2024, our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 
7.50
%. For the period October 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 
6.65
%. Our actual return on plan assets for the year ended December 31, 2024, was a gain of 
5
%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, was a gain of 
15
% and for the year ended December 31, 2022, was a loss of 
20
%. For 2025, we expect to assume a rate of return of 
6.65
%. Our pension plan assets are valued at fair value as of the measurement date.

During 2024, we capitalized $
18
 million of pension and OPEB expense into the cost of our capital expenditures as the costs relate to our engineering and plant construction activities. During 2023, and 2022, we capitalized $
18
 million and $
21
 million of pension and OPEB expense into the cost of our capital expenditures, respectively.

The pension plan contains provisions that provide certain employees with the option of receiving a lump sum payment upon retirement. These payments are recorded as a settlement only if, in the aggregate, they exceed the sum of the annual service and interest costs for the Pension Plan’s net periodic pension benefit cost.

FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

During 2024, lump sum pension payments to terminated or retired individuals amounted to $
108
 million. As we did not exceed the settlement threshold of $
173
 million, we did 
no
t recognize any non-cash settlement charges for 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the pension plan was funded at 
96
%.

As a result of special termination benefit enhancements related to a voluntary separation plan, Frontier remeasured its pension plan obligations, resulting in a remeasurement loss of $
45
 million, of which $
38
 million relates to special termination benefits, for the year ended December 31, 2024.
 The Company’s accounting policy is to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur. As such, this loss was recorded in “Investment and other income, net” on our consolidated statements of operations.

During 2023, lump sum pension payments to terminated or retired individuals amounted to $
129
 million. As we did not exceed the settlement threshold of $
180
 million, we did not recognize any non-cash settlement charges for 2023. 

During 2023, we had actuarial gains of $
44
 million, driven by favorable lump sum conversion interest rates and cash balance interest crediting rates and updated census data to January 1, 2023, offset by a decrease of 
30
 basis points in the discount rate.

As a result of special termination benefit enhancements related to a voluntary separation plan, Frontier remeasured its postretirement benefit plan, resulting in a remeasurement gain of $
35
 million year ended December 31, 2024.

During 2023, we amended the medical coverage for certain postretirement benefit plans, which necessitated remeasurements of our OPEB obligations. These remeasurements along with the period end remeasurement resulted in the recognition of a net actuarial loss of $
3
 million, which was driven primarily from a higher assumed discount rate relative to the previous measurement dates, offset by updated census data to January 1, 2023. 
The Company’s accounting policy is to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur. As such, this loss was recorded in “Investment and other income, net” on our consolidated statements of 
operations. The remeasurements of our OPEB obligations during 2023 due to the amendments to the medical coverage for certain postretirement benefit plans also resulted in remeasurement of prior service credits of $
45
 million which were deferred in Accumulated comprehensive income as December 31, 2023.

During 2022, we amended the medical coverage for certain postretirement benefit plans, which necessitated remeasurements of our OPEB obligations. These remeasurements along with the period end remeasurement resulted in the recognition of a net actuarial gain of $

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
:

Fair value is defined under GAAP as the exit price associated with the sale of an asset or transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under GAAP must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In addition, GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.

The three input levels in the hierarchy of fair value measurements are defined by the FASB generally as follows:

Input Level

Description of Input
Level 1            Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2            Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3            Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists.

The entity invests in commercial real estate properties that are leased to Frontier, with the exception of the E. Casino Road property which is leased to a third party. The leases are triple net, whereby we are responsible for all expenses, including but not limited to, insurance, repairs and maintenance and payment of property taxes.

All Level 3 investments have the same redemption frequency (through the liquidation of underlying investments) and redemption notice period (none). The fair value of these properties is based on independent appraisals.

The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and estimated fair values for long-term debt at December 31, 2024 and 2023. For the other financial instruments including cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable and other current liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the relatively short maturities of those instruments.

The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted market prices at the reporting date for those financial instruments.

Commitments and Contingencies
:

We are party to various legal proceedings (including individual actions, class and putative class actions, and governmental investigations) arising in the normal course of our business covering a wide range of matters and types of claims including, but not limited to, general contract disputes, billing disputes, rights of access, taxes and surcharges, consumer protection, advertising, sales and the provision of services, intellectual property, including, trademark, copyright, and patent infringement, employment, regulatory, environmental, tort, claims of competitors and disputes with other carriers. Litigation is subject to uncertainty and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable. However, we believe that the ultimate resolution of all such matters, after considering insurance coverage or other indemnities to which we are entitled, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Frontier has been named as a defendant in various intellectual property disputes. In each case, we have denied the allegations and are mounting a vigorous defense. We have accrued an amount for potential damages that we deem probable and reasonably estimable. We do not expect that any potential damages, if ultimately incurred, will be material.

On October 22 and October 23, 2024, two complaints were filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York by purported Company stockholders against the Company, the Board, Verizon and Merger Sub in connection with the Merger. The complaints assert claims of negligent misrepresentation and concealment and negligence under New York common law. Among other remedies, the complaints seek an order enjoining the defendants from proceeding with the Merger 

F-

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

unless and until the defendants disclose certain allegedly material information that was allegedly omitted from the proxy statements, rescinding the Merger to the extent already consummated or granting rescissory damages, awarding the plaintiffs costs and disbursements of the action, including reasonable attorneys’ and expert fees and expenses, and granting such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. Additional lawsuits arising out of the proposed Merger may also be filed in the future. Furthermore, the Company has received demand letters from purported Company stockholders alleging disclosure deficiencies in the preliminary proxy statement and/or definitive proxy statement and demanding that the Company and the Board of Directors promptly issue corrective disclosures to cure the proxy statement prior to the anticipated stockholder vote on the proposed Merger. The Company believes that the allegations contained in the complaints and demands have no merit. We do not at this time consider there to be any reasonably possible material loss arising from the demands. There can be no assurance regarding the likelihood that the Company’s defense of any actions will be successful.

During the second quarter of 2024, Frontier reached a settlement with a net financial impact of $
25
 million resolving a dispute with the Chief Executive Officer of Frontier’s predecessor company, who left his position with the company in 2004, concerning split-dollar life insurance benefits granted during his employment.

In November 2021, Congress passed the IIJA which provides $65 billion to fund broadband connectivity programs, including broadband deployment to unserved and underserved locations. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is administering the principal last mile infrastructure funding program in the amount of $42.5 billion, the Broadband Equity, Access & Deployment Program (BEAD), and will distribute funding through direct grants to states, who will then award the funds based on competitive grant programs. The NTIA has allocated approximately $25.5 billion to states in Frontier’s footprint. We are closely tracking implementation of the BEAD program, including participating in state address challenge and pre-application processes. The requirements and funding under these programs is subject to change. We are actively pursuing awards of these stimulus funds; however, we continue to evaluate our opportunities as the process is complex and any awards that we ultimately receive under the IIJA may require significant up-front capital expenditures or other costs. 

On January 27, 2025, the federal Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) issued a memorandum to the heads of all executive departments and agencies directing them to pause the disbursement of certain federal financial assistance. On January 28, 2025, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued a temporary stay of the OMB directive, which the OMB subsequently rescinded. It is uncertain if the OMB will seek to further pause or otherwise limit future federal disbursements, or if any such changes will impact the funding Frontier receives under federal programs, including USF, RDOF and other federal broadband grants including BEAD.  We are closely tracking developments in this area.  Significant decreases in available funding, or the imposition of significant requirements on the receipt of such funding, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   

On April 14, 2024, we detected that a third party had gained unauthorized access to portions of our information technology environment. Upon detection, the Company immediately activated its incident response plan, took action to contain the incident, launched an investigation with the assistance of leading cybersecurity experts, and notified law enforcement and applicable regulatory authorities. We worked with a leading e-discovery firm to undertake a thorough review of the impacted data to identify and provide notice to individuals whose information was impacted. Since the incident, the Company has also taken steps to further strengthen its information technology security. While the incident did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations, the containment measures, which included shutting down certain of the Company’s systems, resulted in an operational disruption.

In October 2013, the California Attorney General’s Office notified certain Verizon companies, including one of the subsidiaries that we acquired in the CTF transaction, of potential violations of California state hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries, and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We have reached a settlement with the California Attorney General’s Office, pending court approval, and have accrued an amount for the settlement penalty.

We accrue an expense for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred. None of our existing accruals for pending matters, after considering insurance coverage, is material. We monitor our pending litigation for the purpose of adjusting our accruals and revising our disclosures accordingly, when required. Litigation is, however, subject to uncertainty, and the outcome of any particular matter is not predictable. We will vigorously defend our interests in pending litigation, and as of this date, we believe that the ultimate resolution of all such matters, after considering insurance coverage or other indemnities to which we are entitled, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or our cash flows.

In 2015, Frontier accepted the FCC’s CAF Phase II offer, which provided $
313
 million in annual support through 2021 in our current 25 states in return for the Company’s commitment to make broadband available to households within the CAF II

eligible areas. The Company was required to complete the CAF II deployment by December 31, 2021. Thereafter, the FCC has been reviewing carriers’ CAF II program completion data, and if the FCC determines that the Company did not satisfy applicable FCC CAF Phase II requirements, Frontier could be required to return a portion of the funds previously received and may be subject to certain fines, requirements and obligations.

On January 30, 2020, the FCC adopted an order establishing the RDOF competitive reverse auction to provide support to serve high-cost areas. Under the FCCs RDOF Phase I auction, we were awarded approximately $
371
 million over 
ten years
 to build gigabit-capable broadband over a fiber-to-the-premises network to approximately 
127,000
 locations in 
eight
 states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia). We began receiving RDOF funding in the second quarter of 2022 and we will be required to complete the buildout to the awarded locations by December 31, 2028, with interim target milestones over this period.  To the extent Frontier is unable to fulfill the RDOF requirements, meet the milestones or construct to all locations by the required deadlines, funding to us could be discontinued and Frontier could be required to return a portion of funds previously received and may be subject to certain fines, requirements and obligations.

On July 24, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that certain delegations of authority in the USF contribution system are unconstitutional. The court remanded the case to the FCC.  The Fifth Circuit subsequently stayed the decision to allow the FCC to file a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review. The stay allows the continued collection of USF contributions while the Supreme Court considers the case. The precise impact of the case is unclear at this time, including the extent to which the decision applies to parties other than the petitioner.  We cannot predict how this or future court decisions will impact the company’s ability to receive federal universal service funds in the future.

We conduct certain of our operations in leased premises and lease certain equipment and other assets pursuant to operating leases. The lease arrangements have terms ranging from 
1
 to 
99
 years and several contain rent escalation clauses providing for increases in monthly rent at specific intervals. When rent escalation clauses exist, we record annual rental expense based on the total expected rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain leases also have renewal options. Renewal options that are reasonably assured are included in determining the lease term.

As of December 31, 2024, we had total “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” of $
1.0
 billion, of which $
758
 million was related to accounts payable. As of December 31, 2023, we had total “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” of $
1.1
 billion, of which $
857
 million was related to accounts payable.

Although from time to time we make short-term purchasing commitments to vendors with respect to capital expenditures, we generally do not enter into firm, written contracts for such activities. In connection with the fiber expansion build, we have prioritized diversifying our vendor base and solidifying partnership agreements with vendors for relevant labor and materials, to enable our build growth and customer expansion. Some of these key supplier agreements have multi-year terms and purchase commitments as we deem advisable in order to strengthen future supply. In addition, we have negotiated favorable payment terms with some of our vendors that allow for a longer payment period than our normal customary terms (referred to as vendor financing), which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities on the statement of cash flows. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $
16
 million and $
263
 million, respectively, of contractual vendor financing liabilities included in “Other current liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2024 we made $
331
 million in contractual vendor financing payments related to capital expenditures.

The following table summarizes the roll forward of the vendor financing liabilities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024:

In addition, we have certain arrangements that are non-contractual but have extended payment terms. We made payments of $

 million related to these arrangements, bringing total capital vendor financing payments to $

 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. 

We are party to contracts with several unrelated long-distance carriers. The contracts provide fees based on traffic they carry for us subject to minimum monthly fees.

At December 31, 2024, we had total letters of credit outstanding of $
265
 million, of which, $
74
 million was used for various Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) rural deployment programs in which the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) provides funds to Frontier to support the construction of rural broadband connectivity, and $
6
 million was used for rent obligations under our administrative office lease terms. 

CNA serves as our insurance carrier with respect to casualty claims (auto liability, general liability, and workers’ compensation) with dates of loss prior to June 1, 2017 (except for those claims which arise out of the operations acquired from CTF that have dates of loss prior to April 1, 2016). As our insurance carrier, they administer the casualty claims and make claim payments on our behalf. We reimburse CNA for such services upon presentation of their invoice. To serve as our carrier and make payments on our behalf, CNA requires that we establish a letter of credit in their favor. CNA could potentially draw against this if we failed to reimburse CNA in accordance with the terms of our agreement. The amount of the letter of credit is reviewed annually and adjusted based on claims history.

Zurich serves as our insurance carrier with respect to casualty claims (auto liability, general liability, and workers’ compensation) with dates of loss from June 1, 2017 and going forward. As our insurance carrier, they administer the casualty claims and make claim payments on our behalf. We reimburse Zurich for such services upon presentation of their invoice. To serve as our carrier and make payments on our behalf, Zurich requires that we establish letters of credit in their favor. Zurich could potentially draw against these letters of credit if we failed to reimburse Zurich in accordance with the terms of our agreement. The amount of the letters of credit is reviewed annually and adjusted based on claims history.
AIG Insurance serves as our insurance carrier with respect to casualty claims (auto liability, general liability, and workers’ compensation) that were acquired from CTF, as well as new claims which arise out of the operations acquired from CTF that have dates of loss prior to April 1, 2016. Sedgwick, a third-party claims administrator, administers the casualty claims and makes claim payments on our behalf. We reimburse Sedgwick for such services upon presentation of their invoice. However, to serve as our insurance carrier, AIG Insurance requires that we establish a letter of credit in their favor. AIG Insurance could potentially draw against this letter of credit if we failed to meet the insurance-related and claims-related obligations we assumed in accordance with the terms of our agreement. The amount of the letter of credit is reviewed annually and adjusted based on claims history

Subsequent Events
:

In January 2025, wildfires in California have impacted certain regions where the Company operates, potentially affecting network infrastructure, service continuity, and maintenance costs. The Company is actively assessing any financial or operational impact and implementing necessary mitigation efforts to ensure network stability and compliance with regulatory requirements. T
he impact to our financial statements, if any, cannot be estimated at this time.
