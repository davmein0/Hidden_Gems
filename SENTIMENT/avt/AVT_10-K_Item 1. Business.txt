Item 1. Business
Avnet, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Avnet”), is a leading global electronic component technology distributor and solutions provider that has served customers’ evolving needs for more than a century. Founded in 1921, the Company works with electronic component manufacturers (suppliers) in every major electronic component segment to serve customers in more than 140 countries.
Avnet serves a wide range of customers: from startups and mid-sized businesses to enterprise-level original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”) providers, and original design manufacturers (“ODMs”). 
Organizational Structure
Avnet has two primary operating groups — Electronic Components (“EC”) and Farnell (“Farnell”). Both operating groups have operations in each of the three major economic regions of the world: (i) the Americas, (ii) Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) and (iii) Asia/Pacific (“Asia”). Each operating group has its own management team, who manage various functions within each operating group. Each operating group also has distinct financial reporting to the executive level, which informs operating decisions, strategic planning, and resource allocation for the Company as a whole. Regional divisions (“business units”) within each operating group serve primarily as sales and marketing units to streamline sales efforts and enhance each operating group’s ability to work with its customers and suppliers, generally along more specific geographies or product lines. However, each business unit relies heavily on support services from the operating groups, as well as centralized support at the corporate level. 
A description of each operating group is presented below. Further financial information by operating group is provided in Note 16 “Segment information” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Electronic Components
Avnet’s EC operating group primarily supports high and medium-volume customers. It markets, sells, and distributes electronic components from many of the world’s leading electronic component manufacturers, including semiconductors, IP&E components (interconnect, passive and electromechanical components), and other integrated and embedded components.
EC serves a variety of markets ranging from industrial to automotive to defense and aerospace. It offers an array of customer support options throughout the entire product lifecycle, including both turnkey and customized design, supply chain, programming, logistics, and post-sales services.
Within the EC operating group for 2025, net sales of approximately 82% consist of semiconductor products, approximately 16% consist of interconnect, passive, and electromechanical components, and approximately 2% consist of computers.

Competition & Markets
The electronic components industry is competitive. The Company’s major competitors include: Arrow Electronics, Future Electronics, World Peace Group, and WT Microelectronics for EC; Mouser Electronics, Digi-Key Electronics, and RS Components for Farnell. There are also certain smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on particular sectors or on narrower geographic locations, markets, or products. As a result of these factors, Avnet’s pricing and product selection and availability must remain competitive.
A key competitive factor in the electronic component distribution industry is the need to carry a sufficient amount and selection of inventory to meet customers’ demand and various delivery requirements. To minimize its exposure related to inventory on hand, the Company purchases most of its products pursuant to franchised distribution agreements, which typically provide certain protections for product obsolescence and price erosion. These agreements are generally cancelable upon 30 to 180 days’ notice and, in most cases, provide for or require inventory return privileges upon cancellation. In addition, the Company enhances its competitive position by offering a variety of value-added services, which are tailored to individual customer specifications and business needs, such as design support, point of use replenishment, labelling, testing, assembly, programming, supply chain management, and materials management.
A competitive advantage is the breadth of the Company’s supplier product line card. Because of the number of Avnet’s suppliers, many customers can simplify their procurement process and can make all or substantially all of their required electronic component purchases from Avnet, rather than purchasing from several different parties.
Seasonality
Historically, Avnet’s business has not been materially impacted by seasonality, except for an impact on consolidated results from shifts in geographic sales trends from Asia in the first half of a fiscal year to the Americas and EMEA regions in the second half of a fiscal year, which impact gross profit and operating income margins as a result of such seasonal geographic sales mix changes.
Human Capital 
The Company values its employees and recognizes their significant contributions to the Company’s success. Its core values of integrity, customer focus, ownership, teamwork, and inclusiveness provide a foundation for its culture and are key expectations of employees. The Company’s culture and commitment to its employees are vital to attracting, motivating, and retaining exceptional talent. Consequently, the Company invests in its global workforce to drive

inclusiveness; provide fair and competitive pay and benefits; foster employee development; promote employees health and safety; and understand employees’ experiences and identify opportunities to improve.

Compensation, Benefits and Wellness
The Company strives to pay all its employees competitively and fairly, without regard to gender, race, or other personal characteristics. The Company sets pay ranges based on market data and considers an employee’s role, experience, tenure, job location, and job performance. The Company periodically reviews its compensation practices, both in terms of its overall workforce and individual employees, to help ensure that pay remains competitive and fair. 
The Company offers an array of benefits that support employees’ well-being. Through its THRIVE program, the Company offers resources covering (1) physical and mental health, fitness, and well-being; (2) professional growth, skills, and development; (3) total rewards, retirement planning and money management; and (4) community connections, networks, and social interests.
Learning and Development 
The Company supports career growth and provides an array of resources and opportunities to help employees reach their potential. There is a structured learning framework as employees progress from individual contributor roles to senior management. Learning and development resources include self-paced courses, books, listen and learn events, mentoring programs and internal and external trainings, which cover a variety of technical, business, interpersonal, and leadership topics. The performance management process provides for goal-setting, ongoing conversations and check-ins between employees and their leaders, and includes coaching and training for people managers. Talent and succession planning activities are conducted for the Company’s executive officers and senior leaders at least annually and periodically for other levels of management.
Health and Safety
The Company aims to create workspaces and practices that foster a safe and secure work environment. In fiscal 2025, continued progress was made with implementing a multi-year plan to improve alignment and consistency of management systems, policies, and procedures; provide comprehensive health and safety training to employees relevant to their specific work functions; drive continual improvement processes with a focus on identified risks; and increase ISO certifications at operational sites. As of June 28, 2025, the Company has 27 operational sites, of which nine are certified to ISO 45001 and 19 are certified to ISO 14001.
Inclusion
The Company strives for (i) an employee population that reflects the diverse communities in which they live, work, and do business, and (ii) a culture that seeks out varying perspectives, which allows the best ideas to come to light.
