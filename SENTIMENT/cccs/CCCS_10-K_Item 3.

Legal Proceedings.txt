SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTOR
S

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” for purposes of the federal securities laws. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future, including those relating to the future financial performance and business strategies and expectations for our business. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, client demand, business strategies, technology developments, financing and investment plans, competitive position, our industry and regulatory environment, potential growth opportunities and the effects of competition.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include:

•
our revenues, the concentration of our customers and the ability to retain our current customers;

•
our ability to negotiate with our customers on favorable terms;

•
our ability to maintain and grow our brand and reputation cost-effectively;

•
the execution of our growth strategy;

•
the impact of public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics on our business and results of operations;

•
our projected financial information, growth rate and market opportunity;

•
the health of our industry, claim volumes, and market conditions;

•
changes in the insurance and automotive collision industries, including the adoption of new technologies;

•
global economic conditions and geopolitical events;

•
competition in our market and our ability to retain and grow market share;

•
our ability to develop, introduce and market new enhanced versions of our solutions;

•
our sales and implementation cycles;

•
the ability of our research and development efforts to create significant new revenue streams;

•
changes in applicable laws or regulations;

•
changes in international economic, political, social and governmental conditions and policies, including corruption risks in China and other countries;

•
our reliance on third-party data, technology and intellectual property;

•
our ability to protect our intellectual property;

•
our ability to keep our data and information systems secure from data security breaches;

•
changes in our customers’ or the public’s perceptions regarding the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”);

•
our ability to acquire or invest in companies or pursue business partnerships;

•
our ability to raise financing in the future and improve our capital structure;

•
our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors;

•
our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing;

•
our ability to expand or maintain our existing customer base; and

•
our ability to service our indebtedness.

The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described above and under the heading “Risk Factors”. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
