Item 3. Legal Proceedings
.

In the ordinary course of business, we are (or may become) parties to litigation involving property, personal injury, contract, intellectual property and other claims, as well as stockholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits and other matters. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage. Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we are not currently a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements included herein. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors” and “Risk Factors” as set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Business Overview

Founded in 1980, CCC is a leading SaaS platform for the multi-trillion-dollar insurance economy powering operations for insurers, repairers, automakers, part suppliers, and more. CCC cloud technology connects more than 35,000 businesses digitizing mission-critical workflows, commerce, and customer experiences. A trusted leader in AI, customer experience, network and workflow management, CCC delivers technology that turns crucial moments into intelligent experiences, with the goal of shaping a world where life just works.

Our business has been built upon two foundational pillars: automotive insurance claims and automotive collision repair. For decades we have delivered leading software solutions to both the insurance and repair industries, including pioneering DRP in the U.S. beginning in 1992. DRP connects auto insurers and collision repair shops to create business value for both parties, and requires digital tools to facilitate interactions and manage partner programs. Insurer-to-shop DRP connections have created a strong network effect for CCC’s platform, as insurers and repairers both benefit by joining the largest network to maximize opportunities. This has led to a virtuous cycle in which more insurers on the platform drives more value for the collision shops on the platform, and vice versa.

We believe we have become a leading insurance and repair SaaS provider in the U.S. by increasing the depth and breadth of our SaaS offerings over many years. Our insurance solutions help insurance carriers manage mission-critical workflows across the claims lifecycle, while building intelligent experiences for their customers. Our software integrates seamlessly with both legacy and modern systems and enables insurers to rapidly innovate on our platform. Our repair solutions help collision repair facilities achieve better performance throughout the collision repair cycle by digitizing processes to drive business growth, streamline operations, and improve repair quality. We have more than 300 insurers on our network, connecting with more than 30,500 repair facilities through our multi-tenant cloud platform. We believe our software is the architectural backbone of insurance DRP systems and is a primary driver of material revenue for our collision repair shop customers and a source of material efficiencies for our insurance carrier customers.

Our platform is designed to solve the “many-to-many” problem faced by the insurance economy. There are numerous internally and externally developed insurance software solutions in the market today, with the vast majority of applications focused on insurance-only use cases and not on serving the broader insurance ecosystem. We have prioritized building a leading network around our automotive insurance and collision repair pillars to further digitize interactions and maximize value for our customers. We have tens of thousands of companies on our platform that participate in the insurance economy, including insurers, repairers, parts suppliers, and automotive manufacturers. Our solutions create value for each of these parties by connecting them with our vast network to collaborate with other companies, streamline operations, and reduce processing costs and dollars lost through claims management inefficiencies, or claims leakage. Expanding our platform has added new layers of network effects, further accelerating the adoption of our software solutions.

We have processed more than $1 trillion of historical data across our network, allowing us to build proprietary data assets that leverage insurance claims, vehicle repair, automotive parts and other vehicle-specific information. We believe we are uniquely positioned to provide data-driven insights, analytics, and AI-enhanced workflows that strengthen our solutions and improve business outcomes for our customers. Our AI solutions streamline existing insurance and repair processes including vehicle damage detection, claim triage, claim handling, repair estimating, intelligent claim review, and claim subrogation. We deliver real-world AI with more than 100 U.S. auto insurers and more than 10,000 U.S. collision repairers actively using AI-powered solutions in production environments.

One of the primary obstacles facing the insurance economy is increasing complexity which is driven by technological advancements, supply-chain disruption, social inflation, medical inflation, and IOT data. We believe digitization plays a critical role in managing this growing complexity while meeting consumer expectations. Our technology investments are focused on digitizing complex processes and interactions across our ecosystem, and we believe we are well positioned to power the insurance economy of the future with our data, network, and platform.

While our position in the insurance economy is grounded in the automotive insurance sector, the largest P&C insurance sector in the U.S. representing nearly half of P&C DWP, we believe our integrations and cloud platform are capable of driving innovation across the broader insurance economy. Our customers are increasingly looking for CCC to expand its solutions to other parts of their business where they can benefit from our technology, service, and partnership. In response, we are investing in new solutions that we believe will enable us to digitize the entire automotive claims lifecycle, and over time expand into adjacencies including other insurance lines. For example, CCC’s acquisition of EvolutionIQ in January 2025 added claims solutions in disability and workers’ compensation insurance lines to CCC’s solution suite.

We have strong customer relationships in the end-markets we serve, and these relationships are a key component of our success given the long-term nature of our contracts and the interconnectedness of our network. We have customer agreements with more than 300 insurers (including carriers, self-insurers and other entities processing insurance claims), including 26 of the top 30 automotive insurance carriers in the U.S., based on DWP, and hundreds of regional carriers. We have more than 35,000 total customers, including more than 30,500 automotive collision repair facilities (including repairers and other entities that estimate damaged vehicles), more than 5,500 parts suppliers, 12 of the top 15 automotive manufacturers based on new vehicle sales, and numerous other companies that participate in the insurance economy.

37

We generate revenue through the sale of software subscriptions and other revenue, primarily from professional services. We generated $944.8 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of 9.1% from the prior year. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $31.2 million, compared to a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 of $90.1 million. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was mainly due to $82.7 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges specific to the Company’s China reporting unit. Adjusted EBITDA increased $44.0 million, or 12%, year-over-year to $397.4 million. See our reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA within the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

The chief executive officer reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by information about revenue by type of service and geographic region, for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.

Recent Developments

Business Acquisition

During January 2025, the Company completed its acquisition of EvolutionIQ, Inc. (“EvolutionIQ”), a privately held company that provides AI-powered guidance for disability and injury claims management. Leveraging EvolutionIQ’s platform, the acquisition will broaden the Company’s portfolio of AI-based solutions available to its insurance customers.

In exchange for all the outstanding shares of EvolutionIQ, the Company paid total consideration of $730 million, net of cash acquired, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Before post-closing adjustments, the total consideration paid to the selling shareholders consisted of 58.9% in cash and 41.1% in shares of CCC’s common stock. The cash consideration paid to the selling shareholders was funded through cash on hand and an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $225 million (the “Incremental Term Loan”).

Long-Term Debt and Refinancing

In conjunction with the acquisition of EvolutionIQ, the Company entered into the third amendment to the 2021 Credit Agreement that provided the Company with an Incremental Term Loan for $225 million. Prior to the Fourth Amendment (as defined below), the Incremental Term Loan was repayable in quarterly installments in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount, with the balance payable at maturity, on September 21, 2028.

Prior to the Fourth Amendment, the interest rate per annum applicable to the Incremental Term Loan was based on a fluctuating rate of interest, determined by the Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement, as amended. In connection with the Fourth Amendment, the Incremental Term Loan was refinanced together with other term loans on the terms outlined in the following paragraph.

On January 23, 2025, the Company entered into the fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the 2021 Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amendment, the Company incurred incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $225 million, which were used to (i) refinance certain outstanding incremental term loans (including the Incremental Term Loan), (ii) extend the maturity of all term loans to January 23, 2032, (iii) remove the credit spread adjustment applicable to SOFR loans, and (iv) reduce the interest rate margin applicable to all term loans to the following rate:

(1) 1.00% in the case of base rate loans, and 2.00% in the case of SOFR (or Euribor or SONIA) loans, and 2.00%, in the case of 			SOFR (or Euribor or SONIA) loans, if S&P and Moody’s Debt First Lien Leverage Ratio Ratings (as defined in the Credit Agreement) are 		below BB- (with a stable outlook) or below Ba3 (with a stable outlook) (or if for any reason this category does not apply, including if the 		Borrower has only one Debt Rating or the Borrower does not have any Debt Rating), and

(2) 0.75%, in the case of base rate loans, and 1.75%, in the case of SOFR (or Euribor or SONIA) loans, if S&P and Moody’s Debt First 		Lien Leverage Ratio Ratings are both BB- (with a stable outlook) or better and Ba3 (with a stable outlook) or better.

Beginning March 31, 2025, the term loans are repayable in quarterly installments in an amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the term loans with the balance payable at maturity, January 23, 2032.

As a result of the extended maturity date of the term loans to January 23, 2032, the Company’s 2021 Revolving Credit Facility matures on September 23, 2029.

Interest Rate Swaps

In February 2025, the Company entered into two floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements (the "Swap Agreements") to reduce its exposure to the variability from future cash flows resulting from interest rate risk related to its floating rate long-term debt. Pursuant to the terms of the Swap Agreements, beginning on the effective date, July 31, 2025, the Company will pay an average fixed interest rate of 4.00% on an aggregate notional amount corresponding to borrowings of $500.0 million in exchange for receipts on the same notional amount at a floating interest rate based on the applicable SOFR at the time of payment. The Swap Agreements expire on July 31, 2027.

Key Performance Measures and Operating Metrics

In addition to our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, we rely on Software Net Dollar Retention Rate (“Software NDR”) and Software Gross Dollar Retention Rate (“Software GDR”) to measure and evaluate our business and to make strategic decisions. Software NDR and Software GDR may not be comparable to or calculated in the same way as other similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Software NDR

We believe that Software NDR provides our management and our investors with insight into our ability to retain and grow revenue from our existing customers, as well as their potential long-term value to us. We also believe the results shown by this metric reflect the stability of our revenue base, which is one of our core competitive strengths. We calculate Software NDR by dividing (a) annualized software revenue recorded in the last month of the measurement period, for example, December for a quarter ending December 31, for unique billing accounts that generated revenue during the corresponding month of the prior year by (b) annualized software revenue as of the corresponding month of the prior year. The calculation includes changes for these billing accounts, such as changes in the solutions purchased, changes in pricing and transaction volume, but does not reflect revenue for new customers added. The calculation excludes: (a) changes in estimates related to the timing of one-time revenue and other revenue, including professional services, and (b) annualized software revenue for smaller customers with annualized software revenue below the threshold of $100,000 for carriers and $4,000 for shops. The customers that do not meet the revenue threshold are small carriers and shops that tend to have different buying behaviors, with a narrower solution focus, and different tenure compared to our core customers (excluded small carriers and shops represent less than 5% of total revenue within these sales channels). Our Software NDR includes carriers and shops who subscribe to our auto physical damage solutions, which account for most of the Company’s revenue, and excludes revenue from smaller emerging solutions with international subsidiaries or other ecosystem solutions, such as parts suppliers and other automotive manufacturers, and excludes CCC casualty solutions which are largely usage and professional service based.

Software GDR

We believe that Software GDR provides our management and our investors with insight into the value our solutions provide to our customers as represented by our ability to retain our existing customer base. We believe the results shown by this metric reflect the strength and stability of our revenue base, which is one of our core competitive strengths. We calculate Software GDR by dividing (a) annualized software revenue recorded in the last month of the measurement period in the prior year, reduced by annualized software revenue for unique billing accounts that are no longer customers as of the current period end by (b) annualized software revenue as of the corresponding month of the prior year. The calculation reflects only customer losses and does not reflect customer expansion or contraction for these billing accounts and does not reflect revenue for new customer billing accounts added. Our Software GDR calculation represents our annualized software revenue that is retained from the prior year and demonstrates that the vast majority of our customers continue to use our solutions and renew their subscriptions. The calculation excludes: (a) changes in estimates related to the timing of one-time revenue and other revenue, including professional services, and (b) annualized software revenue for smaller customers with annualized software revenue below the threshold of $100,000 for carriers and $4,000 for shops. The customers that do not meet the revenue threshold are small carriers and shops that tend to have different buying behaviors, with a narrower solution focus, and different tenure compared to our core customers (excluded small carriers and shops which represent less than 5% of total revenue within these sales channels). Our Software GDR includes carriers and shops who subscribe to our auto physical damage solutions, which account for most of the Company’s revenue, and excludes revenue from smaller emerging solutions with international subsidiaries or other ecosystem solutions, such as parts suppliers and other automotive manufacturers, and excludes CCC casualty solutions which are largely usage and professional service based.

Key Factors Affecting Operating Results

The following are key factors affecting our operating results in the years ending December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

•
Conversion and implementation of new customers:
 We focus significant resources on attracting and onboarding new customers across the various segments of the P&C insurance economy we serve. We have a strong track record of new customer conversion across all our markets. On average, customer implementations take less than three months to complete. A significant portion of our sales force is focused on converting new customer accounts across our industry, and this will continue to be a focus of our business for the foreseeable future.

•
Long-term customer relationships:

We have strong customer relationships in the end-markets we serve, and these relationships are a key component of our success given the long-term nature of our contracts and the interconnectedness of our network. We generate revenue through the sale of SaaS subscriptions and our average contract is approximately three to five years in duration. In 2024, our 

39

national carrier customers included 26 of the top 30 automotive insurers based on DWP, with average customer relationships spanning more than 10 years, as evidenced by our historical Software GDR of 98%-99%.

•
Expansion of solution adoption from existing customers:
 A central part of our strategy is expanding solution adoption across our existing customer base. We have developed long-term relationships with our customers and have a proven track record of successfully cross-selling product offerings. We have the opportunity to realize incremental value by selling additional functionality to customers that do not currently utilize our full solution portfolio. As we innovate and bring new technology and solutions to market, we also have the opportunity to realize incremental value by selling new software solutions to our existing customer base. Capitalizing on this opportunity is a significant driver of our revenue growth and Software NDR.

•
Investment in R&D:
 We have a strong track record of innovation and new solution delivery with our customers. We remain committed to delivering market-leading technology including AI solutions for the P&C insurance economy. We believe that maintaining our software solution leadership is imperative to our growth plan. As a result, we intend to continue making significant investments in research and development to improve and expand our software solutions. Our research and development expenses totaled $201.5 million, $173.1 million and $157.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect that research and development will remain a key investment area for the foreseeable future.

•
Investment in Platform, Privacy, and Security:
 Our technology platform is imperative to our strategy as it enables successful customer implementations, new software delivery, and ongoing performance and delivery. In addition to our investments in R&D, we invest in platform infrastructure, maintenance, privacy, and security protocols to enable performance across our technology platform. We expect investment in these areas to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future.

•
Investment in Sales and Marketing:
 Our sales and marketing efforts are a key component of our growth strategy. Our investments in this area have enabled us to build and sustain our customer base while creating long-term customer relationships. We plan to continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts, including adding sales personnel and expanding marketing activities, to support our business growth. Our sales and marketing expenses totaled $142.2 million, $140.9 million and $119.6 million, in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As the business continues to grow, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future.

Components of Results of Operations

Revenue

Revenue is derived from the sale of SaaS subscriptions and other revenue, primarily professional and other non-software services. Software subscription revenues are comprised of fees from customers for the right to use the hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software. These revenues are billed on either a subscription or transactional basis with subscription revenue recognized ratably over the contract period and transactional revenue recognized when the transaction for the related service occurs. We generally invoice software subscription agreements monthly either in advance or in arrears, over the subscription period. Software subscription revenue accounted for $906.5 million, $830.1 million and $752.5 million, or 96%, of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We continue to expect software subscription revenue to be a high percentage of total revenue as software subscription revenue continues to be a key strategic priority.

Other revenue primarily consists of professional services and other non-software services revenue that is generally transaction-based (where a fee per transaction is charged). Revenues related to such services that are billed on a transaction basis are recognized when the transaction for the related service occurs, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.

Costs and Expenses

Cost of Revenues

Cost of Revenues, Exclusive of Amortization and Impairment of Acquired Technologies

These costs include costs of software subscription and professional services revenue. Our cost of revenues is primarily comprised of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation and costs of external resources used in the delivery of services to customers, including software configuration, integration and implementation services, and customer support activities, third party costs related to hosting the Company’s software for its customers, internal support of production infrastructure, IT security and production environment expenses, depreciation expense, cost of software production, and professional service, license and royalty fees paid to third parties. We expect cost of revenues, exclusive of amortization and impairment of acquired technologies, to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to hire personnel, require additional cloud infrastructure and incur data licensing and royalty fees in support of our revenue growth.

Amortization of Acquired Technologies

We amortize to cost of revenues the capitalized costs of technologies acquired in connection with business acquisitions.

Impairment of Acquired Technologies

Impairment of acquired technologies consists of the impairment charges recognized on our China reporting unit's acquired technologies intangible assets.

Operating expenses

40

Operating expenses are categorized as follows:

Research and Development

Our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, and costs of external development resources involved in the engineering, design and development of new solutions, as well as expenses associated with significant ongoing improvements to existing solutions. Research and development expenses also include costs for certain IT expenses supporting development environments.

We capitalize research and development costs associated with the software development of our new and enhanced customer solutions and platform development. Research and development costs, other than software development costs qualifying for capitalization, are expensed as incurred.

We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to dedicate substantial resources to develop, improve and expand the functionality of our solutions.

Selling and Marketing

Our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for our sales and marketing functions, including sales commissions and stock-based compensation. Additional expenses include advertising costs, marketing costs and event costs, including the Company’s annual industry conference.

We expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase investments to support the growth of our business.

General and Administrative

Additional expenses include professional service fees, insurance premiums, and other corporate expenses that are not allocated to the above expense categories.

We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our operations, hire additional personnel, and incur costs to support the growth of our business.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

Our amortization of intangible assets consists of the capitalized costs of customer relationships in connection with business acquisitions.

Impairment

Impairment consists of impairment charges recognized on our China reporting unit’s goodwill and intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Non-operating income (expense)

Non-operating income (expense) is categorized as follows:

Interest Expense

Interest expense comprises interest incurred on our indebtedness. We expect interest expense to vary each reporting period depending on the amount of outstanding indebtedness and prevailing interest rates.

Interest Income

Interest income comprises interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents balances. We expect interest income to vary each reporting period depending on the amount of our balances in interest bearing accounts and prevailing interest rates.

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities

Change in fair value of warrant liabilities comprises fair value adjustments of the private warrants assumed in connection with the Business Combination. In May 2024, we redeemed all of our outstanding private warrants and none were outstanding as of December 31, 2024.

Other Income-Net

Other income-net consists primarily of changes in fair value of our interest rate cap derivative instruments and income received from our interest rate cap derivative instruments, as well as foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to the impact of transactions denominated in a foreign currency.

41

Income Tax Provision

Income tax provision consists of U.S. federal and state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to current U.S. income tax. Due to cumulative losses, we maintain a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future.

Revenues

42

Revenue increased by $78.4 million to $944.8 million, or 9.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily a result of 6% growth from existing customer upgrades and expanding solution offerings to these existing customers as well as 3% growth from new customers.

Cost of Revenues

Cost of revenues increased by $0.8 million to $231.0 million, or 0.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Cost of Revenues, Exclusive of Amortization and Impairment of Acquired Technologies

Cost of revenues, exclusive of amortization and impairment of acquired technologies, increased $18.7 million to $222.0 million, or 9.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $6.5 million increase in third party fees and direct costs associated with our revenue growth, a $5.8 million increase in depreciation expense related to additional investments in new and enhanced customer solutions and platform development, a $4.7 million increase in personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, and a $1.2 million increase in IT related costs.

Amortization of Acquired Technologies

Amortization of acquired technologies was $9.0 million and $26.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was due to certain acquired technology intangible assets reaching the end of their useful life in April 2024.

Impairment of Acquired Technologies

No impairment was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024. Impairment of acquired technologies was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 due to an impairment charge recognized as a result of lower forecasted earnings and cash flows for the Company’s China reporting unit. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Gross Profit

Gross profit increased by $77.6 million to $713.8 million, or 12.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended

December 31, 2023. Our gross profit margin increased to 75.6% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 73.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in both gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily due to increased software subscription revenues, economies of scale resulting from fixed cost arrangements and lower amortization of acquired technologies, partially offset by the increase in depreciation expense related to additional investments in new and enhanced customer solutions and platform development.

Research and Development

Research and development expense increased by $28.4 million to $201.5 million, or 16.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $21.7 million increase in stock-based compensation, a $6.2 million increase in IT related costs, and a $3.3 million decrease in the amount of capitalized time on new and enhanced customer solutions and platform development, partially offset by a $1.9 million decrease in consulting and professional service costs.

Selling and Marketing

Selling and marketing expense increased by $1.4 million to $142.2 million, or 1.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $6.3 million increase in personnel-related costs, including sales incentives and travel costs, partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expense increased by $26.4 million to $218.2 million, or 13.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $13.3 million increase in personnel-related costs, including a $9.4 million increase in stock-based compensation, a $9.4 million increase in professional service costs and a $3.5 million increase in IT related costs.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

Amortization of intangible assets was $71.8 million and $72.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

There was no impairment charge recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024. We recorded impairment charges of goodwill and intangible assets of $77.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023. The impairment charges were the result of lower forecasted earnings and cash flows for the Company’s China reporting unit. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Interest Expense

43

Interest expense increased by $1.0 million to $64.6 million, or 1.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year

ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to higher variable interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Interest Income

Interest income decreased $4.0 million to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The decrease was due to lower average balances within interest bearing accounts and money market funds during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities

We recognized income of $14.4 million from a change in fair value of warrant liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to expense of $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change in fair value of warrant liabilities during each period was primarily due to changes in the price of the Company’s common stock during each respective period. In May 2024, the Company redeemed the outstanding warrants and as of December 31, 2024, no warrants remained outstanding.

Other Income-Net

Other income-net increased $0.4 million to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $0.7 million increase in income from the interest rate cap derivative instruments and a $0.5 million difference in the change in fair value of the interest rate cap derivative instruments, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in other income.

Income Tax Provision

Income tax provision is $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2024 was due to the Company’s pretax income. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the Company’s taxable income, after the effect of permanent differences related to stock-based compensation expense and the impairment of certain intangible assets.

Comparison of Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2023 to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2022

Refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed on February 28, 2024, for the discussion of the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2023 to the year ended December 31, 2022, the earliest of the three fiscal years presented in the consolidated financial statements.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, and Free Cash Flow, which are each non-GAAP measures, are useful in evaluating our operational performance. We use this non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning, budgeting and forecasting purposes and setting management bonus programs. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP measures, may be helpful to investors in assessing our operating performance and comparing our performance with competitors and other comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate these measures in the same fashion. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures on a supplemental basis.

Adjusted Gross Profit

We believe that Adjusted Gross Profit, as defined below, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. Adjusted Gross Profit is defined as gross profit adjusted for amortization of acquired technologies, stock-based compensation and related employer payroll tax, impairment of acquired technologies  and contract termination costs. The Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by Revenue.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have financed our operations with cash flows from operations. The Company generated $283.9 million of cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $399.0 million

47

and a working capital surplus of $409.8 million. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit totaling $1,095.2 million and $776.0 million principal outstanding on our term loan.

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity under our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations, fund required long-term debt repayments and meet our commitments for capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.

Other than the business acquisition discussed in the “Recent Developments” section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which has closed and for which payment has been completed, we are not currently a party to any material definitive agreement regarding potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary business, applications or technologies. However, we may enter into these types of arrangements, which could reduce our cash and cash equivalents or require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds from financing arrangements may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. We may require additional borrowings under our credit arrangements and alternative forms of financings or investments to achieve our longer-term strategic plans.

Debt

On September 21, 2021, CCC Intelligent Solutions Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, together with certain of the Company’s subsidiaries acting as guarantors entered into a credit agreement (as subsequently amended, the “2021 Credit Agreement”).

The proceeds of the 2021 Credit Agreement and cash on hand were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the Company’s previous credit agreement.

2021 Credit Agreement
—The 2021 Credit Agreement consists of an $800.0 million term loan (the “Term B Loan”) and a revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the “2021 Revolving Credit Facility” and together with the Term B Loan, the “2021 Credit Facilities”). The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility has a sublimit of $75.0 million for letters of credit. The Company received proceeds of $798.0 million, net of debt discount of $2.0 million, related to the Term B Loan.

The Term B Loan requires quarterly principal payments of $2.0 million until June 30, 2028, with the remaining outstanding principal amount required to be paid on the maturity date, September 21, 2028. If the Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement is greater than 3.5, the Term B Loan requires a prepayment of principal, subject to certain exceptions, in connection with the receipt of proceeds from certain asset sales, casualty events, and debt issuances by the Company, and up to 50% of annual excess cash flow, as defined in and as further set forth in the 2021 Credit Agreement. When a principal prepayment is required, the prepayment offsets the future quarterly principal payments of the same amount. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s leverage ratio did not exceed the 3.5 threshold and the Company was not subject to the annual excess cash flow calculation, and as such, not required to make a prepayment of principal.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount outstanding on the Term B Loan is $776.0 million and $784.0 million, respectively, of which $8.0 million is classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on the ratio of CCC Intelligent Solutions Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries’ consolidated first lien net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA for applicable periods specified in the 2021 Credit Agreement.

In May 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2021 Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”) to establish SOFR as the benchmark rate for determining the applicable interest rate, replacing LIBOR. No other terms, including the amount of borrowings, required payments or maturity date, were changed as a result of the Amendment. The Company did not incur any significant costs associated with the Amendment.

Subsequent to the execution of the Amendment, the interest rate per annum applicable to the loans is based on a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the sum of an applicable rate and term SOFR (other than with respect to Euros, Euribor and with respect to British Pounds Sterling, SONIA) with a term as selected by the Company, of one, three or six months (subject to (x) in the case of term loans, a 0.50% per annum floor and (y) in the case of revolving loans, a 0.00% per annum floor).

Prior to the execution of the Amendment, the interest rate per annum applicable to the loans was based on a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the sum of an applicable rate and, at the Company’s election from time to time, either:

(1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the rate last quoted by the Wall Street Journal as the “prime rate,” (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% and (d) with respect to the Term B Loan, 1.50% and with respect to the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, 1.00%, or

(2) a Eurocurrency rate determined by reference to LIBOR (other than with respect to Euros, Euribor and with respect to British Pounds Sterling, SONIA) with a term as selected by the Company, of one, three or six months (subject to (x) in the case of term loans, a 0.50% per annum floor and (y) in the case of revolving loans, a 0.00% per annum floor).

In September 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the 2021 Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) to (i) remove the SOFR credit adjustment applicable to the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) reduce the applicable interest rate for the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility by 0.25%. Additionally, the maturity date for the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility was extended to September 23, 2029, subject to a springing maturity date of June 22, 2028 if greater than $234.0 million of the initial Term B Loan remains outstanding as of such date.

A quarterly commitment fee of up to 0.50% is payable on the unused portion of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the weighted-average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the Term B Loan was 7.6%, 7.5% and 4.2%, respectively.

48

The Company has an outstanding standby letter of credit for $0.7 million which reduces the amount available to be borrowed under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility and as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $249.3 million was available to be borrowed.

Borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Cypress Holdings Intermediate Holdings II, Inc., and certain of its US subsidiaries by a perfected first priority lien on the stock of CCC Intelligent Solutions Inc., and substantially all of its assets, subject to various limitations and exceptions.

The terms of the 2021 Credit Agreement include a financial covenant which requires that, at the end of each fiscal quarter, if the aggregate amount of borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility exceeds 35% of the aggregate commitments, the Company’s leverage ratio cannot exceed 6.25 to 1.00. Borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility did not exceed 35% of the aggregate commitments and the Company was not subject to the leverage test during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Interest Rate Caps
—In August 2022, the Company entered into two interest rate cap agreements to reduce its exposure to increases in interest rates applicable to its floating rate long-term debt. The interest rate cap agreements have an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million and a one-month SOFR cap rate of 4.00% through their expiration in July 2025.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

Our estimated future contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2024 consist of:

•
Principal payments related to our long-term debt and related periodic interest payments;

•
Routine tax payments; 

•
Operating lease liabilities;

•
Long-term licensing agreement; and

•
Other contractual purchase obligations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption, and our assessment, to the extent we have made one, of their potential impact on our financial condition and our results of operations.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on our historical experience, trends and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material.

For information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

•
Revenue Recognition

•
Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

•
Stock-based Compensation

•
Valuation of Warrant Liabilities

Revenue Recognition

Revenue recognition requires judgment and the use of estimates. The Company generates revenue from subscription-based contracts that are billed either on a subscription or transactional basis. Revenue is derived from the sale of SaaS subscriptions, and other revenue, primarily professional and non-software services.

The estimates and assumptions requiring significant judgment under our revenue recognition policy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, are as follows:

Determine the transaction price

The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that no significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will occur. The sale of our SaaS subscriptions may include variable consideration related to usage-based contracts and provisions for additional fees when the volume of a customer’s transactions exceeds agreed upon maximums within defined reporting periods. We estimate variable consideration based on the most likely amount, to the extent that a significant revenue reversal is not probable to occur.

The Company may occasionally recognize an adjustment in revenue in the current period for performance obligations partially or fully satisfied in the previous periods resulting from changes in estimates for the transaction price, including any changes to the Company’s assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the impact on revenue recognized in the respective period, from performance obligations partially or fully satisfied in the previous period, was not significant.

Determine the amortizable life of contract assets

Sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to generally be between three and five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology, and other factors. Most often with larger customers, a new contract or amended master agreement will not include a renewal period that requires

50

assessment of whether the new business and renewal business commissions are commensurate. This is because the solutions and services offered as part of the new contract or amended agreement will be different from the original due to changes in technology and offerings. While the renewal period may be reached, most often a new multi-year agreement is signed that includes new services and features which will pay out a commission on the new services and features at the new business percentage and the renewal services and features at the renewal commission percentage. In situations when the renewal period is triggered, it is typically with smaller customers where the sales commission paid is insignificant. Thus, sales commissions are amortized on a systematic basis over three to five years which corresponds to the period and pattern in which revenue is recognized. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. Amortization expense is included in selling and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

We perform an annual assessment for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets each fiscal year, or whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is below its carrying value.

The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic impairment analyses, we make estimates and significant judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit. Our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that represent the highest and best use for our reporting units. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in goodwill impairment charges. We believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized are appropriate based on the information available to management.

We have two reporting units, Domestic and China, for purposes of analyzing goodwill.

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company performed a qualitative assessment as of November 30, for its Domestic reporting unit’s goodwill and trademark indefinite life intangible assets. For the qualitative analysis, the Company assessed several events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair values of the reporting unit and trademarks, including the significance of the amount of excess fair value over carrying value, consistency of operating margins and cash flows, budgeted-to-actual performance from prior year, overall change in economic climate, changes in the industry and competitive environment, key management turnover, and earnings quality and sustainability. There were no unanticipated changes or negative indicators in the above qualitative factors that would impact the fair values as of the annual impairment date. As such, the Company determined there were no indicators of impairment and that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit and trademarks are greater than their carrying values and therefore performing the next step of the impairment test was unnecessary.

During May 2023, as a result of adverse macroeconomic impacts due to changes in market conditions and increases in interest rates, which contributed to downward revisions to future projected earnings and cash flows, we performed an interim quantitative goodwill test of our China reporting unit. As a result of our quantitative impairment test, we determined the fair value of our China reporting unit was less than its carrying value and we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $77.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.

We used a quantitative approach to measure the fair value of the China reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach, which is a Level 3 measurement. The discounted cash flow analysis requires significant judgments, including estimates of future cash flows, which are dependent on internal forecasts and determination of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, which is risk-adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested. The weighted average cost of capital used for the China reporting unit in the Company’s analysis was 12.5%.

For the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company performed a quantitative impairment test which indicated no impairment and there was no change to the carrying amount of goodwill or trademarks due to impairment.

If management's estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions due to these factors, the estimate of the fair value may change significantly. Such change could result in impairment charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition.

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. We monitor conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. We test these assets for potential impairment whenever our management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The original estimate of an asset’s useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an asset’s useful life or carrying value involve significant judgment regarding estimates of the future cash flows associated with each asset.

There was no impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an impairment charge to its China reporting unit’s customer relationships and acquired technologies intangible assets. The Company’s forecast of the China reporting unit’s expected cash flows indicated the carrying amounts of the intangible assets were not recoverable and therefore the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.3 million.

There was no impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Stock-based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with ASC 718, 
Compensation—Stock Compensation
, which requires the recognition of expense measured based on the grant date fair value of the stock-based awards. Our stock-based awards include stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and shares issued through our employee stock purchase program. Stock-based payment awards that are

51

settled in cash are accounted for as liabilities. Our stock-based awards have service-based vesting, performance-based vesting and performance-based vesting subject to a market condition.

The grant date fair value of our service-based awards, excluding RSUs, is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of each service-based and performance-based RSU is determined using the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each award with performance-based vesting subject to a market condition is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

For stock-based awards with only service conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period only for the portion of awards expected to vest, based on an estimated forfeiture rate. For stock-based awards with only performance conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the explicit performance period when the performance targets are probable of being achieved. As of each reporting period, we estimate the number of RSUs with a performance-based vesting component that are expected to vest based on our current estimate of performance compared to the target metrics and record a cumulative-effect adjustment to stock-based compensation expense when necessary. We recognize stock-based compensation expense on awards with performance-based vesting subject to a market condition when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. The determination of the grant date fair value for these awards is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables, including expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award, the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends. The market condition of these awards impacts the fair value at the grant date and is the reason the Monte Carlo simulation method is utilized to determine fair value. For stock-based awards that are accounted for as liabilities, we remeasure the fair value of the associated liability at each reporting date through settlement using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognize the adjustment as stock-based compensation expense.

See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for more information concerning certain of the specific assumptions we used in applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model and Monte Carlo simulation method to determine the estimated fair value of our stock-based awards with service vesting and performance vesting. Some of these assumptions involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation could be materially different.

Valuation of Warrant Liabilities

We account for our Private Warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. The warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment, thus we classify the warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjust the warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until the warrants are exercised or redeemed. Any change in fair value is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The fair value of the Private Warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding Private Warrants. Following the redemption, we had no Private Warrants outstanding. See Note 5 and Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for more information concerning certain of the specific assumptions we used in applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our Private Warrants. Some of these assumptions involve inherent uncertainties and the application of significant judgment.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates, and inflation, as well as risks to the availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on $776.0 million of borrowings at December 31, 2024 that are floating rate obligations. These market risks result primarily from changes in SOFR or prime rates.

Interest rate fluctuations can affect the fair value of our floating rate debt, as well as earnings and cash flows. If market interest rates rise, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by an increase in interest expense. In contrast, lower interest rates may reduce our borrowing costs and improve our operational results. We continuously monitor our interest rate exposure and have elected to use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk associated with floating rate debt.

As of December 31, 2024, a 100-basis point increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by $7.8 million.

To reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates applicable to our floating rate long-term debt, we have two interest rate cap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million and a one-month SOFR cap rate of 4.00% through their expiration in July 2025.

Foreign Currency Risk

Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, however for operations located in China, the functional currency is the local currency. Although we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of transaction gains and losses related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, we believe that a 10% change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations.

RE
PORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), mezzanine equity and stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition - Refer to Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company generates revenue from contracts that are generally billed either on a monthly subscription or transactional basis. Revenue is made up of a significant volume of transactions and sourced from systems and applications across different business markets. The processing of transactions and recording of revenue involves a combination of manual data input and automation, including migrating, formatting, and combining significant volumes of data across systems and interfaces. Management applies significant effort and judgment in evaluating contracts with customers in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Contracts with Customers.

We identified revenue recognition as a critical audit matter given the increased extent of effort, including the need for us to involve professionals with expertise in information technology (IT), to identify, test, and evaluate the Company's systems, applications, and automated controls.

High level of auditor judgment was necessary to determine the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures with respect to the auditing of revenue in accordance with ASC 606.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our principal audit procedures related to the Company's recording of revenue included the following, among others:

•
With the assistance of our IT specialists, we:

o
Identified the significant systems used to process revenue transactions and tested the general IT controls over each of these systems, including testing of user access controls, change management controls, and IT operations controls.

o
Tested system interface controls and automated controls within the relevant revenue streams, as well as the controls designed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of revenue.

54

•
We tested controls within the relevant revenue business processes, including those in place to record revenue.

•
We selected a sample of contracts and evaluated the terms of the arrangement to assess whether accounting conclusions were in accordance with ASC 606.

•
For a sample of revenue transactions, we tested the selected transactions by agreeing the amount of revenue recognized to source documents and tested the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue.

2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
—The consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), the consolidated statements of mezzanine equity and stockholders’ equity and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
Basis of Accounting
—The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include 100% of the accounts of wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. The ownership interest of the minority investor is recorded as a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary.
Use of Estimates
—The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, and the disclosures of contingent amounts in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Although the Company regularly assesses its estimates, actual results could differ from management’s estimates if past experience or other assumptions are not substantially accurate. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements include the estimation of contract transaction prices, the determination of the amortization period for contract assets, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, the estimates and assumptions associated with the valuation of the warrant liabilities, and the estimates and assumptions associated with stock incentive plans.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
—The Company considers all highly liquid investments, including money market funds, purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. While the Company has deposits that exceed federally insured limits at financial institutions, the Company places its cash and cash equivalents in highly rated institutions. The Company has never experienced losses related to these balances.
Foreign Currency
—The Company’s functional currency is the US dollar, however, for operations located in China, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of the foreign operations are translated to US dollars at exchange rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date, while statement of operations accounts are translated to US dollars at the average exchange rates for the period. Translation gains and losses are recorded and remain as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity until transactions are settled or the foreign entity is sold or liquidated. Gains and losses resulting from transactions that are denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency are recorded to other income–net, in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss)
.
Significant Customers and Concentration of Credit Risks
—The Company is potentially subject to concentration of credit risk primarily through its accounts receivable. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses which, when realized, have been within the range of management’s expectations. The Company generally does not require collateral. Credit risk on accounts receivables is minimized as a result of the large and diverse nature of the Company’s customer base.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023
, and 2022 no single customer represented more than 
10
% of revenue.
As of December 31, 2024
, one customer had an account receivable of 
11
% of accounts receivable. As of 
December 31, 2023
, no customer had an account receivable greater than 
10
% of accounts receivable.

60

Revenue Recognition
—The Company’s revenue recognition policy follows guidance from Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The Company generates revenue from contracts that are generally billed either on a monthly subscription or transactional basis. Other revenue primarily consists of professional services and other non-software services revenue that is generally transaction-based (where a fee per transaction is charged). Revenues are recognized as control of these services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services.
The Company determines revenue recognition based on the application of the following steps:
•
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer
•
Identification of the performance obligation(s) in the contract
•
Determination of the transaction price
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract
•
Recognition of revenue when, or as a performance obligation is satisfied
Software Subscription Revenues
—Software services are hosted and provide customers with the right to use the hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software and are generally billed on either a monthly subscription or transactional basis. Revenues related to services billed on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract period as this is the time period over which services are transferred to the customer, generally between three and five years.
Revenues from subscription services represent a stand-ready obligation to provide access to the Company’s platform. As each day of providing services is substantially the same and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as access is provided, subscription arrangements include a series of distinct services. The Company may provide certain of its customers with implementation activities such as basic setup, installation and initial training that the Company must undertake to fulfill the contract. These are considered fulfillment activities that do not transfer the service to the customer.
For contracts with fixed and variable consideration, to the extent that customers’ usage exceeds the committed contracted amounts under their subscriptions, they are charged for their incremental usage. In addition to overage fees, consideration may vary due to discounts, incentives, and potential service level credits or contractual penalties. For such variable consideration, the Company includes an estimate of the most likely amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. When customers’ usage falls below the committed contracted amounts, the customer does not receive any credits or refunds for the shortfall.
For contracts where fees are solely based on transaction volume, the amount invoiced corresponds directly with the value provided to the customer, and revenue is recognized when invoiced using the as-invoiced practical expedient.
Other Revenue
—Other revenues consist of professional services and other non-software services and are recognized over time as the services are performed. Other revenues are generally invoiced monthly in arrears.
Revenues related to such services that are billed on a transactional basis are recognized when the transaction for the related service occurs. Transaction revenue is primarily comprised of fees for services applied to the volume of transactions. These are typically based on a per-unit rate and are invoiced for the same period in which the transactions were processed and as the performance obligation is satisfied. For contracts with transaction fees, the amount invoiced corresponds directly with the value provided to the customer, and revenue is recognized when invoiced using the as-invoiced practical expedient.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
—The Company’s contracts with customers can include access to different software applications such as CCC workflow, estimating, valuation and analytics, each of which is its own performance obligation. These additional services are either sold on a standalone basis or could be used on their own with readily available resources. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately, if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price for distinct performance obligations is generally based on directly observable pricing. In instances where standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company determines standalone selling price based on overall pricing objectives, which take into consideration observable data, market conditions and entity-specific factors.
The Company may occasionally recognize an adjustment in revenue in the current period for performance obligations partially or fully satisfied in the previous periods resulting from changes in estimates for the transaction price, including any changes to the Company’s assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the impact on revenue recognized in the current period, from performance obligations partially or fully satisfied in the previous period, was not significant.
Contract Liabilities
—Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include customer billings in advance of revenues being recognized from subscription contracts and professional services. Deferred revenue that is expected to be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded as current, and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent and included within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Costs to Obtain and Fulfill the Contract
—The Company defers costs that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, including sales commissions. Costs to fulfill contracts are capitalized when such costs are direct and related to

implementation activities for hosted software solutions. Capitalized costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfill a contract are generally amortized over a period between three and five years, which represents the expected period of benefit of these costs and corresponds to the contract period.
In instances where the contract term is significantly different than our general contract terms of between three and five years, costs to obtain and fulfill are amortized over the contract term which the Company believes best reflects the period of benefit of these costs.
Cost of Revenues
—Cost of revenues is primarily composed of personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, and costs of external resources used in the delivery of services to customers, including software configuration, integration and implementation services, customer support activities, third party costs related to hosting the Company’s software for its customers, internal support of production infrastructure, information technology (“IT”) security costs, depreciation expense, cost of software production, and data licensing and royalty fees paid to third parties. Cost of revenues also includes amortization of internal use software, including capitalized development costs, and amortization and impairment of acquired technologies.
Research and Development
—Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, and costs of external development resources involved in the engineering, design and development of new solutions, as well as expenses associated with significant ongoing improvements to existing solutions. Research and development expenses also include IT hosting costs for the development and test environments. Research and development costs, other than software development costs qualifying for capitalization, are expensed as incurred.
Selling and Marketing
—Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for our sales and marketing functions, including sales commissions and stock-based compensation. Additional expenses include advertising costs, marketing costs and event costs, including the Company’s annual industry conference.
The Company expenses advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred. Advertising expenses were
 $
2.0
 million, $
1.5
 million and $
1.1
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, respectively.
General and Administrative
—General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for our executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, internal systems IT, facilities and legal functions. Additional expenses include professional service fees, insurance premiums, and other corporate expenses that are not allocated to the above expense categories.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
—Amortization of intangible assets consists of the capitalized costs of intangible assets. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (see Note 11).
Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairments
—Goodwill and intangible asset impairments includes the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges specific to the Company's China reporting unit (see Note 11).
Stock-Based Compensation
—The Company’s stock-based compensation plans are described in Note 20. The Company accounts for stock-based payment awards based on the grant date fair value. The incremental fair value of modifications to stock-based payment awards is estimated at the date of modification. Stock-based payment awards that are settled in cash are accounted for as liabilities. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for only the portion of awards expected to vest, based on an estimated forfeiture rate.
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for time-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. Stock-based compensation expense for performance-based awards with a market condition is recognized over the estimated service period, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied.
The fair value of RSUs with only a time-based vesting component or a performance-based vesting component is determined using the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. As of each reporting period, we estimate the number of RSUs with a performance-based vesting component that are expected to vest based on our current estimate of performance compared to the target metrics and record a cumulative-effect adjustment to stock-based compensation expense when necessary. For stock-based awards that are accounted for as liabilities, we remeasure the fair value of the associated liability at each reporting date through settlement using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and recognize the adjustment as stock-based compensation expense.
The fair value of the Company’s stock options with only a time-based component is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The fair value of the Company’s performance-based awards with a market condition is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

Stock-based compensation expense related to purchase rights issued under the CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc. 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) is based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model’s fair value of the estimated number of awards as of the beginning of the applicable offering period. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the applicable offering period.
The inputs and assumptions utilized under these methods require judgments and estimates. Changes in the inputs and assumptions could affect the measurement of the estimated fair value of the related compensation expense of these stock-based payment awards.
Accounts Receivable—Net
—An account receivable is recorded when an unconditional right to consideration exists, such that only the passage of time is required before of consideration is due. Accounts receivable—net includes contract assets resulting from subscription agreements with ramped billing schedules.

62

Accounts receivable, as presented in the consolidated balance sheets, are net of customer sales allowances and credit losses. The Company determines allowances for its sales reserves and credit losses based on specific identification of customer accounts and historical experience to the remaining accounts receivable balance. The Company’s assessment of credit losses includes estimating its expected credit losses based on historical information and adjusted for current conditions and forecasts for the probability of collection from customers. Credit losses are charged to general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss)
.
Software, Equipment, and Property—Net
—Software, equipment, and property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the assets’ estimated useful lives, which are as follows:

 Software, equipment, and property

 Estimated Useful Life

 Software and licenses

2
-
5
 years

 Computer equipment

3

 Furniture and other equipment

5
 years

 Database

25
 years

 Building

39
 years

 Leasehold improvements

Lesser of the estimated useful life or life of lease

 Land

Indefinite

Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Significant improvements and enhancements are capitalized.
Internal Use Software
—The Company capitalizes the direct costs incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software, including platform development, infrastructure and tools, as well as certain payroll and payroll-related costs of employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalized payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. The costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Additionally, the Company expenses internal costs related to minor upgrades and enhancements as it is impractical to separate these costs from normal maintenance activities. Capitalized internal use software costs are recorded within software, equipment, and property on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
—Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of November 30 of each year.

Under GAAP, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors in order to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units or indefinite life intangible assets is greater than its carrying value (“Step 0”). If the qualitative assessment leads to a determination that the fair value is less than its carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test (“Step 1”) by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite life intangible asset and comparing the fair value with its associated carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess, up to the carrying value of the goodwill or indefinite life intangible asset.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company performed its annual impairment tests as of November 30 for its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and determined no impairment existed.

During May 2023, the Company performed an interim quantitative impairment test for its China reporting unit due to events which indicated that the carrying amount was in excess of its estimated fair value. As a result of the interim quantitative impairment test, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $
77.4
 million (see Note 11).

Subsequent to the impairment charge recognized in May 2023, the Company performed its annual impairment test for its Domestic reporting unit, its remaining reporting unit with goodwill and indefinite lived assets as of November 30, 2023 and determined no impairment existed.
Long-Lived Assets
—Long-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value.

There were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying value may not be recoverable and no impairment charges were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company performed the recoverability test on its China reporting unit’
s intangible assets due to events which indicated the carrying amount may not be recoverable. As a result, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $
5.3
 million (see Note 11).

There were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying value may not be recoverable and 
no
 impairment charges were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022.

Equity Method Investment
—The Company accounts for its 
7
% investment in a limited partnership using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the investee’s accounts are not reflected within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive 
income (loss)
. The Company’s investment was initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post acquisition changes in the Company’s share of the investee’s earnings which would be recorded in other income-net.

63

Deferred Financing Costs
—Deferred financing costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the underlying financing agreement (see Note 15).
Business Combinations
—The Company allocates the purchase consideration of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess recorded to goodwill. These estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments may be recorded to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration related to business combinations on the date of acquisition (see Note 3). The fair value of the contingent consideration was remeasured each reporting period, with any change in the fair value recorded within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss)
.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements
—Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value.
Level 1
—Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
Level 2
—Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3
—Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.
Warrant Liability
—Upon consummation of the Business Combination, the Company assumed the outstanding warrants previously sold in a private placement (“Private Warrants”) by Dragoneer.
The Company accounted for its Private Warrants under ASC 815-40, 
Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity
, in conjunction with the SEC Division of Corporation Finance’s April 12, 2021 Public Statement, 
Staff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (“SPACs”)
. The terms of the warrants provided for potential changes to the settlement amounts dependent upon the characteristics of the warrant holder, and precluded the warrants from being classified in equity and thus the warrants were classified as a liability. Accordingly, the Company recorded the warrants as long-term liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet at fair value upon the closing of the Business Combination, with subsequent changes in the fair value of the warrants recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) at each reporting date.
The Private Warrants were redeemed during the year ended December 31, 2024 (see Note 21). Prior to their redemption, the Private Warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions utilized under the Black-Scholes option pricing model require judgments and estimates. Changes in these inputs and assumptions could affect the measurement of the estimated fair value of the related fair value of the Private Warrants.
Derivative Instruments
—The Company records derivative instruments as an asset or liability measured at fair value each reporting period. The Company has not designated its derivatives as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and recognizes the changes in fair value within its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Gain and losses from the change in fair value and cash payments and receipts related to the derivative instruments are recognized in other income (expense)—net, in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss)
. The Company does not enter into derivative instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes.
Income Taxes
—Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial and income tax reporting basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income taxes relate to the timing of recognition of certain revenue and expense items, and the timing of the deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes that differs from the timing for financial reporting purposes. The Company establishes a tax valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable against future taxable income.
A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation process, based on its technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Employee Insurance Benefits
—The Company maintains a self-insured group medical program. The program contains stop loss thresholds with amounts in excess of the self-insured levels fully insured by third-party insurers. Liabilities associated with this program are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience and medical cost trends.
Leases
—The Company’s lease policy follows guidance from ASC 842, 
Leases
.
In accordance with ASC 842, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a lease. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, the Company records the related operating or finance right of use asset and lease liability at the present

64

value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company is generally not able to readily determine the implicit rate in the lease and therefore uses the determined incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the market interest rate the Company would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease. Renewal options are not included in the measurement of the right of use assets and lease liabilities unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the optional renewal periods. Some leases also include early termination options, which can be exercised under specific conditions. Additionally, certain leases contain incentives, such as construction allowances from landlords. These incentives reduce the right-of-use asset related to the lease.
Some of the Company’s leases contain rent escalations over the lease term. The Company recognizes expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for all asset categories. Therefore, the lease payments used to measure the lease liability for these leases include fixed minimum rentals along with fixed non-lease component charges. Lease related costs, which are variable rather than fixed, are expensed in the period incurred. The Company does not have significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants in the lease portfolio.
Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest
—The Company presents a redeemable non-controlling interest as mezzanine equity within its consolidated balance sheets when it is redeemable at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date at the option of the holder or upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the Company.
The redeemable non-controlling interest was initially measured at fair value on the date of issuance. When the redemption of a mezzanine-classified non-controlling interest becomes probable, the carrying amount of the redeemable non-controlling interest is increased by periodic accretions using the interest method so that the carrying amount will equal the redemption amount on the date that the shares become redeemable. These adjustments are recorded as accretion of redeemable non-controlling interest, with an offset to additional paid-in capital, on the consolidated statements of mezzanine equity and stockholders’ equity (see Note 17).

Any such charges to additional paid-in capital affect net income (loss) available to CCC common stockholders as part of the Company’s calculation of net income (loss)
 per share attributable to common stockholders.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
—Effective for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07,
 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. 
This update improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through additional disclosures about significant segment expenses. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07, which was applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements however it resulted in incremental disclosures (see Note 27).
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
—In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. This update requires new disclosures aimed at enhancing transparency in financial reporting by requiring disaggregation of specific expense captions within the statement of operations. Under the update, entities are required to disclose a breakdown of certain expense categories, such as: employee compensation; depreciation; amortization, and other material components. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the disclosure requirements related to this update.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.
 This update requires entities to disclose disaggregated information about their effective tax rate reconciliation as well as expanded information on income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The disclosure requirements will be applied on a prospective basis, with the option to apply them retrospectively. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the disclosure requirements related to this update.

3.       BUSINESS ACQUISITION
On February 8, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Safekeep, Inc. (“Safekeep”), a privately held company that leverages AI to streamline and improve subrogation management across auto, property, workers’ compensation and other insurance lines of business. Leveraging Safekeep’s AI-enabled subrogation solutions, the acquisition broadens the Company’s portfolio of cloud-based solutions available to its insurance customers.
In exchange for all the outstanding shares of Safekeep, the Company paid total cash consideration of $
32.3
 million upon closing. In accordance with the acquisition agreement, the Company placed $
6.0
 million in escrow for a general indemnity holdback to be paid to the sellers within 15 months of closing, subject to reduction for certain indemnifications and other potential obligations of the selling shareholders. The remaining cash held in escrow was paid to the sellers in May 2023.

As additional consideration for the shares, the acquisition agreement includes a contingent earnout for additional cash consideration. The potential amount of the earnout is calculated as a multiple of revenue, above a defined floor, during the 12-month measurement period ending December 31, 2024 and was not to exceed $
90.0
 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date of $
0.2
 million was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model that relies on unobservable inputs, including management estimates and assumptions. Upon the end of the 12-month measurement period, the contingent earnout was determined to be zero and no additional consideration was paid to the selling shareholders.

The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred was $
32.5
 million, which consisted of the following (in thousands):

Cash paid through closing

$

32,300

$

32,500

The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and reflects the application of acquisition accounting in accordance with ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
. The total purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date with the excess purchase price assigned to goodwill. The goodwill was primarily attributable to the expected synergies from the combined service offerings and the value of the acquired workforce. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

The Company’s estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent consideration are based on information that was available at the date of the acquisition. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments may be recorded to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. The Company recorded a measurement period adjustment to reflect the facts and circumstances in existence at the acquisition date in December 2022. The adjustment relates to the valuation of the deferred tax liabilities for $
0.9
 million, with a corresponding increase in goodwill. There were no other significant changes to the preliminary purchase price allocation.

The purchase price allocation of estimated fair values was finalized as of December 31, 2022. 
The following table summarizes the final allocation of the consideration to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (in thousands):

 and is being amortized on a straight-line basis.
The fair value of the acquired technology intangible asset was determined by a valuation model based on estimates of future operating projections as well as judgments on the discount rate and other variables. This fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs, including management estimates and assumptions and thus represents a Level 3 measurement.

The Company incurred transaction costs associated with the acquisition of
 $
1.2

million, included in general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss)
 for the year ended December 31, 2022.

5.         FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Private Warrants
—Upon consummation of the Business Combination, the Company assumed Private Warrants issued by Dragoneer. In May 2024, the Private Warrants were redeemed and as of December 31, 2024
, 
no
 Private Warrants were outstanding (see Note 21).
As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s Private Warrants were recognized as liabilities and measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

The Private Warrants were valued using Level 1 and Level 2 inputs within the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumption utilized under the Black-Scholes option pricing model require judgments and estimates. Changes in these inputs and assumptions could affect the measurement of the estimated fair value of the Private Warrants. Accordingly, the Private Warrants were classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The valuation of the Private Warrants as of 
December 31, 2023 was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions:

December 31,

2023

Expected term (in years)

2.6

Expected volatility

34

%

Expected dividend yield

0

%

Risk-free interest rate

4.10

%

The estimated fair value of each Private Warrant using the Company's stock price on the valuation date and the above assumptions was
 $
2.89

as of December 31, 2023.
Contingent Consideration Liability
—During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company determined that the threshold for contingent consideration relating to its acquisition of Safekeep (see Note 3) was not met and as of December 31, 2024, the Company does not have a liability for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration. As of December 31, 2023, the contingent consideration liability had an estimated fair value of $
0.1
 million.

The contingent consideration liability was adjusted each reporting period for changes in fair value, which can result from changes in anticipated payments and changes in the assumed discount rate. These inputs are unobservable in the market and therefore, the contingent consideration liability was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2023.

The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration at the date of acquisition was determined using probability-weighted discounted cash flows and a Monte Carlo simulation model. The discount rate used to estimate fair value is based on the Company’
s estimated cost of debt and was 
10
%.
As of December 31, 2023, the contingent consideration liability was classified within other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

—In August 2022, the Company entered into two interest rate cap agreements to reduce its exposure to increases in interest rates applicable to its floating rate long-term debt (See Note 15). The fair value of the interest rate cap agreements was estimated using inputs that were observable or that could be corroborated by observable market data and therefore, was classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company did not designate its interest rate cap agreements as hedging instruments and records the changes in fair value within other income-net on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The interest rate cap agreements’
 fair value was $
1.0
 million, classified within other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of 
December 31, 2024. The interest rate cap agreements'
 fair value was $
6.2
 million, classified within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 
2023.

Valuation Allowance
—The Company has accumulated net operating losses related to its foreign subsidiaries of $
10.5
 million and $
10.9
 million at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively. A valuation allowance equal to 
100
% of the related tax benefit has been established as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
. The valuation allowance changed $(
0.4
) million, $
0.5
 million and $(
1.0
) million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The changes in the valuation allowance during each year were due to foreign subsidiaries
’ net operating losses in the current year and the expiration of prior year’s net operating losses. No amounts were released during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
. The net operating losses are set to expire in 
2025
 through 
2029
 as China allows for a five-year carryforward.

The Company believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, will not significantly change over the following twelve months. However, due to the open statute of limitations within the various jurisdictions in which the Company files tax returns, the amount of any change cannot be reasonably estimated and it is possible there could be significant changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits over the following twelve months.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount accrued for interest and penalties was not material. The Company reflects its liability for unrecognized tax benefits within income taxes payable and other liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets. The amounts included in “reductions for tax positions of prior years” represent expirations of statutes of limitation and decreases in the unrecognized tax benefits relating to settlements reached with taxing authorities during each year shown.

11.       GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill and intangible assets are primarily the result of business acquisitions.
The Company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of November 30 of each year.

During the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for its reporting unit with goodwill and its trademark indefinite life intangible assets. For the qualitative analysis performed as of November 30 each year, the Company assessed several events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair values of the reporting unit and trademarks, including the significance of the amount of excess fair value over carrying value, consistency of operating margins and cash flows, budgeted-to-actual performance from prior year, no significant changes to projected forecasts, overall change in economic climate, changes in the industry and competitive environment, key management turnover, and earnings quality and sustainability. There were no unanticipated changes or negative indicators in the above qualitative factors that would impact the fair values as of the annual impairment date. As such, the Company determined there were no indicators of impairment and that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit and trademarks are greater than their carrying values and therefore performing the next step of the impairment test was unnecessary.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s China reporting unit experienced adverse impacts as a result of changes in market conditions and increases in interest rates which contributed to reduced forecasted revenues and reduced projected future cash flows.

As a result of these adverse impacts, the Company performed an interim quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of its China reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. When performing the assessment, the Company determined the fair value of its China reporting unit based on forecasted future cash flows. Based on the Company’s forecast of the future cash flows of its China reporting unit, it was determined the carrying value of goodwill for its China reporting unit was impaired and the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $
77.4
 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.
The Company used a quantitative approach to measure the fair value of its China reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach, which is a Level 3 measurement. The discounted cash flow analysis requires significant judgments, including estimates of future cash flows, which are dependent on internal forecasts and determination of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, which is risk-adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested. The weighted average cost of capital used for the China reporting unit in the Company’s analysis was 
12.5
%.
For the year ended December 31, 2022
 the Company performed a quantitative impairment test which indicated 
no
 impairment and there was 
no
 change to the carrying amount of goodwill or trademarks due to impairment.
The following table presents the gross amount, accumulated impairment loss, and net carrying amount of goodwill as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an impairment charge to its China reporting unit’s customer relationships and acquired technologies intangible assets. The Company’s forecast of the China reporting unit’s expected cash flows indicated the carrying amounts of the intangible assets were 
no
t recoverable and therefore the Company recorded an impairment charge of $
5.3
 million.
No
 intangible asset impairments were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022.

15.       LONG-TERM DEBT
On September 21, 2021, CCC Intelligent Solutions Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, together with certain of the Company’s subsidiaries acting as guarantors entered into a credit agreement (as subsequently amended, the “2021 Credit Agreement”).
The proceeds of the 2021 Credit Agreement and cash on hand were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the Company’s previous credit agreement.
2021 Credit Agreement
—The 2021 Credit Agreement consists of an $
800.0
 million term loan (the “Term B Loan”) and a revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of $
250.0
 million (the “2021 Revolving Credit Facility” and together with the Term B Loan, the “2021 Credit Facilities”). The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility has a sublimit of $
75.0
 million for letters of credit. The Company received proceeds of $
798.0
 million, net of debt discount of $
2.0
 million, related to the Term B Loan.

The Company incurred $
9.8
 million in financing costs related to the Term B Loan, recorded to a contra debt account. The financing costs are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of the Term B Loan and 2021 Revolving Credit Facility using the effective interest method.
The Term B Loan requires quarterly principal payments of $
2.0
 million until 
June 30, 2028
, with the remaining outstanding principal amount required to be paid on the maturity date, 
September 21, 2028
. If the Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement is greater than 3.5, the Term B Loan requires a prepayment of principal, subject to certain exceptions, in connection with the receipt of proceeds from certain asset sales, 
casualty events, and debt issuances by the Company, and up to 
50
% of annual excess cash flow, as defined in and as further set forth in the 2021 Credit Agreement. When a principal prepayment is required, the prepayment offsets the future quarterly principal payments of the same amount. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’
s leverage ratio did not exceed the 
3.5
 threshold and the Company was not subject to the annual excess cash flow calculation, and as such, 
no
t required to make a prepayment of principal.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the amount outstanding on the Term B Loan is $
776.0
 million and $
784.0
 million, respectively, of which $
8.0
 million is classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on the ratio of CCC Intelligent Solutions Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries’ consolidated first lien net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA for applicable periods specified in the 2021 Credit Agreement.

In May 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the 2021 Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”) to establish SOFR as the benchmark rate for determining the applicable interest rate, replacing LIBOR. No other terms, including the amount of borrowings, required payments or maturity date, were changed as a result of the Amendment. The Company did not incur any significant costs associated with the Amendment.
Subsequent to the execution of the Amendment, the interest rate per annum applicable to the loans is based on a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the sum of an applicable rate and term SOFR (other than with respect to Euros, Euribor and with respect to British Pounds Sterling, SONIA) with a term as selected by the Company, of one, three or six months (subject to (x) in the case of term loans, a 
0.50
% per annum floor and (y) in the case of revolving loans, a 
0.00
% per annum floor.

Prior to the execution of the Amendment, the interest rate per annum applicable to the loans was based on a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the sum of an applicable rate and, at the Company’s election from time to time, either:

75

(1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the rate last quoted by the Wall Street Journal as the “prime rate,” (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 
0.50
%, (c) one-month LIBOR plus 
1.00
% and (d) with respect to the Term B Loan, 
1.50
% and with respect to the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility, 
1.00
%, or
(2) a Eurocurrency rate determined by reference to LIBOR (other than with respect to Euros, Euribor and with respect to British Pounds Sterling, SONIA) with a term as selected by the Company, of one, three or six months (subject to (x) in the case of term loans, a 
0.50
% per annum floor and (y) in the case of revolving loans, a 
0.00
% per annum floor).
In September 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the 2021 Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) to (i) remove the SOFR credit adjustment applicable to the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) reduce the applicable interest rate for the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility by 
0.25
%. Additionally, the maturity date for the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility was extended to September 23, 2029, subject to a springing maturity date of June 22, 2028 if greater than $
234.0
 million of the initial Term B Loan remains outstanding as of such date.
At the time of entering into the 2021 Credit Agreement, the Company incurred $
3.1
 million in financing costs related to the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company incurred $
0.7
 million in financing costs related to the Second Amendment. These costs were recorded to a deferred financing fees asset account and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility.

A quarterly com
mitment fee of up to 
0.50
% is payable on the unused portion of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
, the weighted-average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the Term B Loan was 
7.6
%, 
7.5
% and 
4.2
%, respectively.

The Company has an outstanding standby letter of credit for $
0.7
 million which reduces the amount available to be borrowed under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility and as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, $
249.3
 million was available to be borrowed.
Borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Cypress Holdings Intermediate Holdings II, Inc., and certain of its US subsidiaries by a perfected first priority lien on the stock of CCC Intelligent Solutions Inc., and substantially all of its assets, subject to various limitations and exceptions.
The 2021 Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants, that among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to: incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, engage in mergers, consolidations, liquidations or dissolutions; pay dividends and distributions on, or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock; and make certain investments, acquisitions, loans, or advances.
The terms of the 2021 Credit Agreement include a financial covenant which requires that, at the end of each fiscal quarter, if the aggregate amount of borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility exceeds 
35
% of the aggregate commitments, the Company’s leverage ratio cannot exceed 
6.25
 to 
1.00
. Borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility did not exceed 35% of the aggregate commitments and the Company was not subject to the leverage test during the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Interest Rate Caps
—In August 2022, the Company entered into two interest rate cap agreements to reduce its exposure to increases in interest rates applicable to its floating rate long-term debt. The interest rate cap agreements have an aggregate notional amount of $
600.0
 million and a one-month SOFR cap rate of 
4.00
% through their expiration in 
July 2025
. The fair value of the interest rate cap agreements was estimated using inputs that were observable or that could be corroborated by observable market data and therefore, was classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company did not designate its interest rate cap agreements as hedging instruments and records the changes in fair value within earnings.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company transitioned the referenced interest rate within the two interest rate cap agreements from LIBOR to SOFR by terminating the original agreements and simultaneously entering into new agreements. The terms of the new agreements were unchanged except for the referenced interest rate. The Company elected the optional expedients available within ASC 848 to allow for this transition without any modification to the derivative classification of the interest rate cap agreements.
As of December 31, 2024
, the interest rate cap agreements had a fair value of $
1.0
 million, classified within other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 
2023
, the interest rate cap agreements had a fair value of $
6.2
 million classified within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
Cash received related to the interest rate cap agreements was $
7.2
 million and 
$
6.5
 million for the
 years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, recorded within other income-net on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss)
. Cash received related to the interest rate cap agreements was insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2022.

16.       LONG-TERM LICENSING AGREEMENT
During 2018, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with a third party to obtain a perpetual software license (“Licensing Agreement”) for a database structure, tools, and historical data used within the Company’s software. The Company has included the present value of the future payments required as a long-term licensing agreement within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The present value of the future payments was computed using an effective annual interest rate of 
6.25
%, and the Licensing Agreement requires the Company to make quarterly principal and interest installment payments of approximately $
1.2
 million through December 2031.
The present value of the future cash flows upon execution of the agreement
 was $
45.6
 million, which included an original discount of $
23.2

million. At December 31, 2024, the remaining liability, net of the dis
count was $
27.7
 million, with $
3.3
 million
 classified as current. At December 31, 2023
, the remaining liability, net of the discount was $
30.8
 million, with $
3.1
 million classified as current.

The discount was recorded to a contra liability account and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the agreement using the effective interest method. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized 
$
1.9
 million
, $
2.0
 million and $
2.2
 million, respectively, in interest expense related to the Licensing Agreement. The unamortized discount as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 
$
6.7
 million
 and $
8.6
 million, respectively.

17.       REDEEMABLE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST
On March 12, 2020 (the “Close Date”), the Company closed a stock purchase agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with a third-party investor (the “Investor”) for purchase by the Investor of Series A Preferred Stock in CCCIS Cayman Holdings Limited (“CCC Cayman”), the parent of the Company’s China operations. On the Close Date, CCC Cayman, a subsidiary of the Company, issued 
1,818
 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Shares”) at $
7,854
 per share to the Investor for net proceeds of $
14.2
 million. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, on an as-converted basis, the Preferred Shares represent an aggregate 
10.0
% ownership interest of the issued and outstanding capital stock of CCC Cayman, or 
8.6
% on a fully-diluted basis.

The Preferred Shares are entitled to non-cumulative dividends at an annual rate of 
8.0
%, when and if declared.

77

At the option of the Investor, the Preferred Shares are convertible into ordinary shares of CCC Cayman, initially on a one-for-one basis but subject to potential adjustment, as defined by the Stock Purchase Agreement, at any time, or automatically upon the closing of an initial public offering.
The Preferred Shares are redeemable upon an actual or deemed redemption event as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement or at the option of the Investor beginning on the five-year anniversary of the Close Date, if an actual or deemed redemption event has not yet occurred. The redemption price, as defined by the Stock Purchase Agreement, is equal to the original issue price of the Preferred Shares, plus 
10.0
% compound interest per annum on the Preferred Share issue price, plus any declared but unpaid dividends on the Preferred Shares.
The Preferred Shares are entitled to distributions upon the occurrence of a sale or liquidation of CCC Cayman representing an amount that is equal to the original issue price of the Preferred Shares, plus 10.0% compound interest per annum on the Preferred Share issue price, plus any declared but unpaid dividends.
The Preferred Shares do not participate in net income or losses.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Investor’s ownership in CCC Cayman is classified in mezzanine equity as a redeemable non-controlling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in the control of the Company.

As of May 31, 2023, the Company determined it was probable the non-controlling interest would become redeemable and began to accrete the non-controlling interest to its redemption value. Changes in the carrying value of the non-controlling interest are recorded as adjustments to additional paid-in capital.

The grant date fair value of each RSU with time-based vesting and performance-based vesting is determined using the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of each performance-based RSU with a market condition is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model.

79

Stock-based compensation for RSUs with time-based vesting is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the number of RSUs that are probable of vesting. Stock-based compensation for performance-based RSUs or performance-based RSUs with a market condition is recognized on a straight-line basis over the performance period based on the number of RSUs that are probable of vesting.
During 2023, the Company’
s Board approved modifications to the performance-based RSUs subject to a market condition. The modifications included: 
(i) the extension of the performance period by one year, (ii) a change to the performance criteria, (iii) a change to the number of units to be issued depending on performance and (iv) for certain grants, imposing a maximum number of units to be issued depending on performance equal to 
100
% of the target. 
The modification to the performance-based RSUs subject to a market condition resulted in incremental stock-based compensation expense of $
67.0
 million, which will be recognized ratably over the modified performance periods.

December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:

Cayman Equity Incentive Plan
—During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company adopted the CCCIS Cayman Holdings Employees Equity Incentive Plans (“Cayman Incentive Plans”), which provide for the issuance of stock option awards in CCC Cayman (“Cayman Awards”) to eligible employees of the Company’s China subsidiaries.

Pursuant to the Cayman Incentive Plans, the number of Cayman Shares that may be subject to stock incentives is not to exceed 
3,000,000
 in the aggregate.

Awards under the Cayman Incentive Plans are settled in cash and thus accounted for as liability awards. Awards granted under the Cayman Incentive Plans have time-based vesting and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date.
The Company records stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Time-based awards generally vest ratably over a four-year period based on continued service. Vesting of the time-based awards can be accelerated in certain circumstances, such as an initial public offering, as defined in the Cayman Incentive Plans.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted 
761,743
, 
539,400
 and 
1,303,000
 stock options under the Cayman Incentive Plans, respectively. The exercise price of the optio
ns granted is at least equal to the fair value of the underlying shares at the grant date. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
2,363,514
 and 
1,735,900

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
—In October 2021, the Company’s Board adopted the ESPP. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under the ESPP, employee purchases occur at the end of discrete offering periods. The six-month offering periods begin on January 1 and July 1 of each year (or such other date determined by the board of directors).
Under the ESPP, eligible employees can acquire shares of the Company’s common stock by accumulating funds through payroll deductions. Employees generally are eligible to participate in the ESPP if they are a U.S. employee and are employed for at least 20 hours per week. The Company may impose additional restrictions on eligibility. Eligible employees can select a rate of payroll deduction between 
1
% and 
15
% of their compensation. The purchase price for shares of common stock purchased under the ESPP is 
85
% of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on (i) the first day of the applicable offering period or (ii) the last day of the purchase period in the applicable offering period. An employee’s participation automatically ends upon termination of employment for any reason.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
12,062,991
 and 
6,031,287
 shares of common stock, respectively, are reserved for sale under the ESPP
. The aggregate number of shares reserved for sale under the ESPP increases on January 1 by the lesser of 
1
% 
of the total numbers of shares outstanding or a lesser amount as determined by the Board. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the board of directors allowed the number

81

of 
shares of common stock reserved under the ESPP to increase, in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, by 
6,031,287
 shares. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the board of directors elected not to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved under the ESPP.
During the years ending December 31, 2024
, 2023 and 2022, 
608,891
, 
641,691
 and 
408,879
 shares were sold under the ESPP, respectively.

The fair value of ESPP purchase rights sold during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

Company Earnout Shares
—Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, CCCIS shareholders and option holders, subject to continued employment, have the right to receive up to an additional 
13.5
 million shares and 
1.5
 million shares of common stock, respectively, if, before the tenth anniversary of the Closing, (a) the share price has been greater than or equal to $
15.00
 per share for any 
twenty
 trading days within any 
thirty
 consecutive trading day period beginning after Closing, or (b) there is a change in control, as defined in the Business Combination Agreement.
The fair value of the Company Earnout Shares was estimated on the date of the grant, using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Compensation expense on the shares granted to option holders was recorded ratably over the implied service period of five months beginning on July 30, 2021.

21.      WARRANTS
Upon consummation of the Business Combination, the Company assumed the outstanding Private Warrants issued by Dragoneer.
Private Warrants could only be exercised for a whole number of shares of the Company’s common stock. Each whole Private Warrant entitled the registered holder to purchase one share of the Company’s common stock. All warrants had an exercise price of $
11.50
 per share, subject to adjustment, beginning on August 29, 2021, and were to expire on 
July 30, 2026 
or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Additionally, the Private Warrants were exercisable on a cashless basis and were non-redeemable, so long as they were held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants were held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Warrants were redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders.
During May 2024, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding Private Warrants for aggregate of 
3,809,200
 shares of the Company’s common stock. The holder of the Private Warrants received 
0.214
 shares of common stock for each Private Warrant exchanged. No cash was paid by the Company in exchange for the redeemed Private Warrants. 
The Private Warrants were valued at the time of redemption using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

23.       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is from time to time, involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. The litigation process is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that the resolution of such matters might have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s consolidated financial condition and/or results of operations.

26.       NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
The Company calculates basic earnings per share by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The diluted earnings per share is computed by assuming the exercise, settlement and vesting of all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method. We exclude common stock equivalent shares from the calculation if their effect is anti-dilutive. In a period where the Company is in a net loss position, the diluted loss per share is calculated using the basic share count. The 
8,625,000
 Sponsor Vesting Shares that are issued and outstanding at 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are excluded from the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding until the vesting requirement is met and the restriction is removed.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to compute basic earnings per share of common stock (in thousands, except for share and per share data).

27.       SEGMENT INFORMATION AND INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS
The Company organizes its segments around its operations by geographic region and operates in 
one
 reportable segment (the “Domestic Segment”). The Domestic Segment provides a SAAS platform for the P&C insurance economy and derives revenues from providing customers with software subscriptions to the platform in addition to providing professional services and non-software services. The accounting policies of the Domestic Segment are the same as those described in Note 2.
The Company does not have intra-entity sales or transfers.
The chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) of the Domestic Segment is the Company’s
 chief executive officer
. The CODM assesses performance for the Domestic Segment at the segment level and uses the segment’s performance when making strategic decisions on how to allocate resources and capital. In addition, the segment’s performance is used when reviewing actual financial performance against budget and for establishing incentive compensation targets.
The CODM uses net income to evaluate income generated from operations in deciding whether to reinvest profits into the Domestic Segment or use for acquisitions, to pay dividends or repurchase outstanding shares of common stock
. The CODM reviews financial information, including significant expenses, of the Domestic Segment on an adjusted basis, excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company’s recurring core business operations. This financial information reviewed by the CODM is accompanied by information about revenue by type of service and geographic region, for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.
The Company’s financial information and performance measures used by the CODM do not include a metric or measure including segment assets and thus, no asset information is provided to the CODM for the purpose of making strategic decisions or allocating resources.
The following table presents the Company’s financial information about reported segment revenue, significant segment expenses, and the Company’s reconciliation of segment profit (loss) to consolidated net income (loss) (in thousands):

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Acquisition of Evolution IQ
—On January 6, 2025, the Company completed its acquisition of EvolutionIQ, Inc. (“EvolutionIQ”), a privately held company that provides AI-powered guidance for disability and injury claims management. Leveraging EvolutionIQ’s platform, the acquisition will broaden the Company’s portfolio of AI-based solutions available to its insurance customers.
In exchange for all the outstanding shares of EvolutionIQ, the Company paid total consideration of $
730
 million, net of cash acquired, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The total consideration paid to the selling shareholders consisted of 
58.9
% in cash and 
41.1
% in shares of CCC’s common stock.
The cash consideration paid to the selling shareholders was funded through cash on hand and an incremental term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $
225.0
 million (the “Incremental Term Loan”).

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company incurred acquisition related expenses of $
8.7
 million, recognized within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
The initial accounting for the acquisition of EvolutionIQ, including the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is incomplete as a result of the proximity of the acquisition date to the date these consolidated financial statements were issued.
Long-Term Debt and Refinancing
—In conjunction with the acquisition of EvolutionIQ, the Company entered into the third amendment to the 2021 Credit Agreement that provided the Company with an Incremental Term Loan for $
225
 million. Prior to the Fourth Amendment (as defined below) the Incremental Term Loan was repayable in 
quarterly
 installments in an amount equal to 
0.25
% of the original principal amount, with the balance payable at maturity, 
September 21, 2028
.
Prior to the Fourth Amendment, the interest rate per annum applicable to the Incremental Term Loan was based on a fluctuating rate of interest, determined by the Company's leverage ratio, as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement, as amended. In connection with the Fourth Amendment, the Incremental Term Loan was refinanced together with other term loans outlined in the following paragraphs.
On January 23, 2025, the Company entered into the fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the 2021 Credit Agreement.

Pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amendment, the Company incurred incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $
225
 million, which were used to (i) refinance certain outstanding incremental term loans (including the Incremental Term Loan), (ii) extend the maturity of all term loans to January 23, 2032, (iii) remove the credit spread adjustment applicable to SOFR loans, and (iv) reduce the interest rate margin applicable to all term loans to the following rate:
(1) 
1.00
% in the case of base rate loans, and 
2.00
% in the case of SOFR (or Euribor or SONIA) loans, and 
2.00
%, in the case of SOFR (or Euribor or SONIA) loans, if S&P and Moody’s Debt First Lien Leverage Ratio Ratings (as defined in the Credit Agreement) are below BB- (with a stable outlook) or below Ba3 (with a stable outlook) (or if for any reason this category does not apply, including if the Borrower has only one Debt Rating or the Borrower does not have any Debt Rating), and
(2) 
0.75
%, in the case of base rate loans, and 
1.75
%, in the case of SOFR (or Euribor or SONIA) loans, if S&P and Moody’s Debt First Lien Leverage Ratio Ratings are both BB- (with a stable outlook) or better and Ba3 (with a stable outlook) or better.
Beginning March 31, 2025, the term loans are repayable in quarterly installments in an amount equal to 
0.25
% of the original principal amount of the term loans with the balance payable at maturity, 
January 23, 2032
.
As a result of the extended maturity date of the term loans to January 23, 2032, the Company’s 2021 Revolving Credit Facility matures on September 23, 2029.
Interest Rate Swaps
—In February 2025, the Company entered into two floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements (the "Swap Agreements") to reduce its exposure to the variability from future cash flows resulting from interest rate risk related to its floating rate long-term debt. Pursuant to the terms of the Swap Agreements, beginning on the effective date, July 31, 2025, the Company will pay an average fixed interest rate of 
4.00
% on an aggregate notional amount corresponding to borrowings of $
500.0
 million in exchange for receipts on the same notional amount at a floating interest rate based on the applicable SOFR at the time of payment. The Swap Agreements expire on 
July 31, 2027
.

86

The Company did not designate the Swap Agreements as a hedging instrument and will record the change in fair value within earnings.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedure
s.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the guidelines set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures or the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of CCC Intelligent Solutions Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

88

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
