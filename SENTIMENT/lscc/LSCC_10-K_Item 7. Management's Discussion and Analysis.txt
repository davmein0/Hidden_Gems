Our product development activities include new proprietary products, advanced packaging, existing product enhancements, software development tools, soft IP, and system solutions for high-growth applications such as Edge AI, 5G infrastructure, platform security, and factory automation.

This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this report. Discussions of results for prior periods (fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022) are incorporated by reference from our 
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023
.

Impact of Global Economic Activity on our Business

Increased financial market volatility, inflationary pressure, interest rate changes, recessionary concerns, uncertainty in the financial and banking industry, and geopolitical tension continue to impact business globally and may impact our operations by causing disruption to our labor markets and supply chains. The extent to which increased financial market volatility, inflationary pressures, global pandemics, and related uncertainty will impact our business activities will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Additionally, our business is impacted by the cyclic correction affecting the broader semiconductor industry, which has seen softened demand across our end markets.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

Critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when made, and because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.

We believe the following accounting policies and the related estimates are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. See 
Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies
 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information on the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

We recognize revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations when control of promised goods or services has been transferred to our customers. We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. For revenue recognized on both sales to distributors and related to royalties, the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to receive is based on estimates that require assumptions and judgments relating to trends in recent and historical activity. See 
Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information on our recognition of revenue. Sales to most distributors are made under terms allowing certain price adjustments upon sale to their end customers and limited rights of return of our products held in their inventory. The revenue recognized based on estimated price adjustments and stock rotation reserves may be materially different from the actual consideration received if the actual distributor price adjustments and stock rotation returns differ significantly from the historical trends used in the estimates.

Inventories and Cost of Revenue

Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. We review and set standard costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of actual spending over actual costs. The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate excess or obsolete inventory. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining provisions for excess or obsolete products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, projected customer demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. The creation of such provisions results in a write-down of inventory to net realizable value and a charge to Cost of revenue. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future market or economic conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in Cost of revenue, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to Cost of revenue resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.

Accounting for Income Taxes

We are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. These estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of the applicable year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the difference is expected to reverse.

Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that in management’s judgment is more-likely-than-not to be recoverable against future taxable income. The determination of a valuation allowance and when it should be released requires complex judgment. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, we regularly evaluate both positive and negative evidence that may exist and consider whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (ii) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; (iii) taxable income in prior carryback year(s) if carryback is permitted under the tax law; and (iv) viable and prudent tax planning strategies.

We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets due to insufficient income sources. We will continue to evaluate both positive and negative evidence in future periods to determine if we will realize the deferred tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if sufficient positive evidence exists. We do not maintain a valuation allowance on a significant portion of our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets or in any foreign jurisdictions as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize those net deferred tax assets in the future periods.

As part of our regular financial review process, we also assess the likelihood that our tax reporting positions will ultimately be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. To the extent it is determined it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of a tax reporting position will ultimately not be recognized and sustained, a provision for unrecognized tax benefit is provided by either reducing the applicable deferred tax asset or accruing an income tax liability. Our judgment regarding the sustainability of our tax reporting positions may change in the future due to changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the related deferred tax assets or accrued income tax liabilities and an accompanying reduction or increase in income tax expense which may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in net income in the period when such determinations are made. Accordingly, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 included $27.7 million of income tax benefits due to the expiration of statutes of limitations that reduced our uncertain tax positions. We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income as a period cost.

Revenue decreased $227.8 million, or 31%, in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to softer demand in industrial and automotive applications, telecommunications infrastructure deployments, and from continued inventory normalization by customers.

Revenue by End Market

We sell our products globally to a broad base of customers in three primary end market groups: Communications and Computing, Industrial and Automotive, and Consumer. Across our end markets, our products are increasingly used for AI-related applications, including device usage in AI-optimized servers in data centers, AI-enabled PCs, and AI-enabled robotics and ADAS systems, among others. We also provide IP licensing and services to these end markets.

Within these end markets, there are multiple drivers, including:

•

Communications and Computing: data center servers and networking equipment, client computing platforms, and wireless and wireline communications infrastructure deployments,

•

Industrial and Automotive: factory automation, robotics, automotive electronics, and industrial IoT,

•

Consumer: smart home, prosumer, and other applications.

The end market data we use is derived from data provided to us by our distributors and end customers. With a diverse base of customers who may manufacture end products spanning multiple end markets, the assignment of revenue to a specific end market requires the use of judgment. We also recognize certain revenue for which end customers and end markets are not yet known. We assign this revenue first to a specific end market using historical and anticipated usage of the specific products, if possible, and allocate the remainder to the end markets based on either historical usage for each product family or industry application data for certain product types.

The following are examples of end market applications for the fiscal years presented:

Revenue from the Communications and Computing end market decreased by 11% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 primarily due to softer end market demand in telecommunications infrastructure deployments and from continued inventory normalization by customers, partially offset by stronger demand in data center applications.

Revenue from the Industrial and Automotive end market decreased by 45% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily 
due 
to softer end market demand and from continued inventory normalization by customers.

While we do not consider AI applications as a distinct end market, we expect AI-related revenue to grow over the next few years based on the growing pipeline of AI-related design wins. Our AI revenue is derived from applications across all three of our end market segments.

Revenue by Geography

We have a diverse base of customers where distributors represent a significant portion of our total revenue. Our revenue by geographical market is based on the ship-to location of our customers, which can vary from time to time. Revenue from Asia decreased in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 
primarily
 due to the macroeconomic environment in the region, while revenue from the Americas and Europe decreased due to reduced demand in these regions for our products in the Industrial and Automotive end market.

Gross margin percentage decreased 300 basis points from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024. Reduced margins were primarily due to an approximately $7.0 million one-time charge for expiring production materials, and changes in product mix between the periods presented
.
 The expiring production materials were purchased on behalf of the company by the OSATs in anticipation of a supply constraint and are no longer expected to be used. We expect gross margin to increase in future periods due to the non-recurrence of the one-time charge.

Research and development expense includes headcount-related costs, including cash- and stock-based compensation and benefits, R&D equipment expenses, engineering wafers, licenses, and outside engineering services. These expenditures are for the design of new products, IP cores, processes, packaging, and software solutions.

The decrease in Research and development expense for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was due primari
ly 
to lower costs for outside services and R&D equipment expenses, partially offset by increased headcount-related costs and rent expense.

We believe that investing in research and development is important to delivering innovative products to our customers. We expect research and development expense to increase in the future, but to decline as a percentage of revenue.

The decrease in Selling, general, and administrative expense for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was due primarily to a reduction in stock compensation expense from the forfeiture of equity awards by departing executives and reduced headcount-related costs as we aligned resources to the lower level of business, partially offset by other costs such as outside services and legal expenses.

Restructuring activity is generally comprised of expenses resulting from workforce reductions, cancellation of contracts, and consolidation of our facilities. Details of our restructuring plans and expenses incurred under them are discussed in 
Note 8 - Restructuring
 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Restructuring costs increased in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 primarily due to higher severance costs incurred under the Q3 2024 Plan as we aligned resources to the lower level of business.

Impairment of Acquired Intangible Assets

In connection with our acquisition of Mirametrix in November 2021 we recorded identifiable intangible assets related to existing technology, customer relationships, and trade name / trademarks. 
Our review of our strategic long-range plan completed at the end of fiscal 2024 concluded that the originally acquired Mirametrix intangible assets had limited future revenue potential due to a decline in customer demand, which we determined was an indicator of impairment. Our assessment of the fair value of these intangible assets concluded that they had been fully impaired as of December 28, 2024, and we recorded an impairment charge of $13.9 million for fiscal 2024 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Our Income tax (benefit) expense on worldwide income for fiscal 2024 includes $27.7 million of income tax benefits due to the expiration of statutes of limitations that reduced our uncertain tax positions, as well as federal tax credits, and stock-based compensation. The lower income tax benefit in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to the reduction in valuation allowance over the $56.9 million of U.S. Federal deferred tax assets in 2023. The income tax benefit from the release of a portion of the valuation allowance was partially offset by an increase in expense in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to increased worldwide income and U.S. tax on foreign operations.

We updated our evaluation of the valuation allowance position in the United States through December 28, 2024. In making this evaluation, we considered our operating environment and estimates about our ability to generate taxable income in future periods within the United States. As a result of our consistent and continued profitability over the preceding three-year period and our expectations about generating sufficient U.S. Federal taxable income, we have determined that there is sufficient evidence that our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized.

We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets due to insufficient income sources. We will continue to evaluate both positive and negative evidence in future periods to determine if we will realize those deferred tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if sufficient positive evidence exists. We do not maintain a valuation allowance in any foreign jurisdictions as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize those net deferred tax assets in the future periods. Details of our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance are discussed in 
Note 12 - Income Taxes
 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income before net interest income (expense), income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and other items that are considered unusual or not representative of underlying trends of our business, including but not limited to: litigation expense outside the ordinary course of business, restructuring, transformation, and other charges, impairments, and other non-recurring charges, if applicable for the periods presented. 

We believe that the exclusion of the items eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA provides useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and our Board of Directors. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a tool for comparison. 

       33

Table of Contents

There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA include (i) Adjusted EBITDA does not properly reflect capital commitments to be paid in the future, and (ii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the underlying assets may need to be replaced and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect these potential capital expenditures. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items, as in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Evaluation of our performance should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including our net income and other GAAP results.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following sections discuss material changes in our financial condition from the end of fiscal 2023, including the effects of changes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the effects of our credit arrangements and contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources. There continues to be uncertainty around the extent of market volatility, inflationary pressures, interest rate changes, recessionary concerns, uncertainty in the financial and banking industry, and geopolitical tension, which may impact our liquidity and working capital needs in future periods.

We have historically financed our operating and capital resource requirements through cash flows from operations, and from the issuance of long-term debt to fund acquisitions. Cash provided by or used in operating activities will fluctuate from period to period due to fluctuations in operating results, the timing and collection of accounts receivable, and required inventory levels, among other things.

We believe that our financial resources, including current cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities, and our credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and working capital needs through at least the next 12 months. On September 1, 2022, we entered into our 2022 Credit Agreement, as described in 
Note 7 - Long-Term Debt
 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. As of December 28, 2024, we did not have significant long-term commitments for capital expenditures. For further information on our cash commitments for operating lease liabilities, see 
Note 9 - Leases
 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

In the future, we may continue to consider acquisition opportunities to further extend our product or technology portfolios and further expand our product offerings. In connection with funding capital expenditures, acquisitions, securing additional wafer supply, increasing our working capital, or other operations, we may seek to obtain equity or additional debt financing. We may also seek to obtain equity or additional debt financing if we experience downturns or cyclical fluctuations in our business that are more severe or longer than we anticipated when determining our current working capital needs.

As of December 28, 2024, we had Cash and cash equivalents of $136.3 million, of which approximately $71.2 million in Cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We manage our global cash requirements considering, among other things, (i) available funds among our subsidiaries through which we conduct business, (ii) the geographic location of our liquidity needs, and (iii) the cost to access international cash balances. The repatriation of non-US earnings may require us to withhold and pay foreign income tax on dividends. This should not result in our recording significant additional tax expense as we have accrued expense based on current withholding rates. As of December 28, 2024, we could access all cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without incurring significant additional expense.

The net increase in Cash and cash equivalents of $8.0 million between December 30, 2023 and December 28, 2024 was primarily driven by cash flows from the following activities:

Operating activities — 
Cash provided by operating activities results from net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities was $140.9 million in fiscal 2024 compared to $269.6 million in fiscal 2023. This decrease of $128.7 million was primarily driven by a decrease of $159.8 million provided by operating activities, partially offset by $31.1 million of net changes in working capital, primarily in Accounts receivable and Inventories.

Investing activities —
 Investing cash flows consist primarily of transactions related to capital expenditures and payments for software and intellectual property licenses
.
 Net cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2024 was $37.7 million compared to $33.3 million in fiscal 2023.

Financing activities —
 Financing cash flows consist primarily of activity on our long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, tax payments related to the net share settlement of restricted stock units, and proceeds from the exercise of options to acquire common stock. Net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2024 was $94.5 million compared to $253.7 million in fiscal 2023. This $159.2 million decrease was due to the following activities. During fiscal 2024, we had no balance outstanding on our long-term debt, while during fiscal 2023 we made discretionary payments totaling $130.0 million on revolving loans under the 2022 Credit Agreement. We repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for $67.0 million in fiscal 2024 compared to repurchases of approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock for $80.0 million in fiscal 2023. Payments for tax withholdings on vesting of RSUs partially offset by employee exercises of stock options used net cash flows of $27.5 million in fiscal 2024, a decrease of approximately $16.2 million from the net $43.7 million used in fiscal 2023.

Accounts receivable, net as of December 28, 2024 decreased by approximately $23.3 million, or approximately 22%, compared to December 30, 2023. This decrease was due to lower revenue shipments as well as the timing of when our customers want our products. We calculate Days sales outstanding on the basis of a 365-day year as Accounts receivable, net at the end of the quarter divided by sales during the quarter annualized and then multiplied by 365.

Inventories as of December 28, 2024 increased $4.6 million, or approximately 5%, compared to December 30, 2023 primarily as a result of product buildup ahead of new product ramps and from softer demand as customers continue to normalize their own inventories. Days of inventory on hand increased over the period due to lower revenue.

The Days of inventory on hand ratio compares the inventory balance at the end of a quarter to the cost of sales in that quarter. We calculate Days of inventory on hand on the basis of a 365-day year as Inventories at the end of the quarter divided by Cost of sales during the quarter annualized and then multiplied by 365
.

Credit Arrangements

On September 1, 2022, we entered into our 2022 Credit Agreement. The details of this arrangement are described in 
Note 7 - Long-Term Debt
 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. As of December 28, 2024, we had no used or unused credit arrangements beyond the secured revolving loan facility described in the 2022 Credit Agreement.

Share Repurchase Program

See "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" under Part II, Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the share repurchase program.

New Accounting Pronouncements

The information contained under the heading "New Accounting Pronouncements" in 
Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies
 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 7.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We assess these risks on a regular basis and have established policies that are designed to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

While our revenues and the majority of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, our financial position and results of operations are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of having various international subsidiary and branch operations. Historically, exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk has not had a material impact on our results from operations. At times in the past, we have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in relation to certain activities, which mitigated the foreign currency exchange rate exposure from an economic perspective, but these were not designated as "effective" hedges under U.S. GAAP.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest Income

Our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. As of December 28, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in less than $1.5 million change in interest income.

Interest Expense

We may be exposed to interest rate risk via the terms of our 2022 Credit Agreement, which specifies an interest rate on revolving loans that consists of a variable-rate of interest and an applicable margin. While we have drawn from this credit facility in the past, we have no borrowings outstanding as of December 28, 2024. If we borrow from the credit facility in the future, we will again be exposed to interest rate fluctuations.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). They include the accounts of Lattice and its subsidiaries after the elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information. While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when made, and because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, the actual results that we experience 
 may 
differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.

Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.

Fiscal Reporting Periods

We report based on a 
52
 or 
53
-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to 
 December 31. 
Our fiscal 
2024,

2023,
 and 
2022
 were all 
52
-week years that ended on 
 December 28, 2024, 
 December 30, 2023, 
and 
 December 31, 2022, 
respectively. Our fiscal 
2025
 will be a 
53
-week year and will end on 
 January 3, 2026. 
All references to quarterly or annual financial results are references to the results for the relevant fiscal period.

Concentrations of Risk

Potential exposure to concentrations of risk 
 may 
impact revenue, trade accounts receivable, a
nd supply of wafers for our new products
.

Sales to distributors have historically accounted for a significant portion of our total revenue. Certain of our largest distributors each account for more than 
10%
 of our total revenue and our net accounts receivable. Revenue attributable to distributors as a percentage of total revenue is presented in the following table:

Certain of our distributors accounted for more than

 of net accounts receivable at the dates presented. At 
 December 28, 2024 
and 
 December 30, 2023
, Arrow accounted for approximately 
36

45
% and

18
% of net accounts receivable at 
 December 30, 2023.

Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is mitigated by our credit and collection process including active management of collections, credit limits, routine credit evaluations for essentially all customers, and secure transactions with letters of credit or advance payments where appropriate. We regularly review our allowance for doubtful accounts and the aging of our accounts receivable. 

We rely on a limited number of foundries for our wafer purchases. We seek to mitigate the concentration of supply risk by establishing, maintaining, and managing multiple foundry relationships; however, certain of our products are sourced from a single foundry and changing from 
one
 foundry to another can have a significant cost, or create delays in production or shipments, among other factors.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all investments that are readily convertible into cash and that have original maturities of 
three
 months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments in time deposits or money market accounts and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Deposits with financial institutions at times exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.

Foreign Exchange and Translation of Foreign Currencies

While our revenues and the majority of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, we also have international subsidiaries and branch operations that conduct some transactions in currencies that differ from the functional currency of that entity. Gains or losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations on balances denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currencies are reflected in Other income (expense), net.

We translate accounts denominated in foreign currencies in accordance with ASC 
830,
 “
Foreign Currency Matters
,” using the current rate method under which asset and liability accounts are translated at the current rate, while stockholders' equity accounts are translated at the appropriate historical rates, and revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates. Translation adjustments related to the consolidation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in Stockholders' equity (See our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity).

Revenue Recognition

Under the terms of ASC 
606,

"Revenue from Contracts with Customers"
, we recognize revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or services to customers. For sales to distributors, we have concluded that our contracts are with the distributor, rather than with the distributor’s end customer, as we hold a contract bearing enforceable rights and obligations only with the distributor. Our revenue is derived primarily from sales of silicon-based products, with additional revenue from sales of silicon-enabling products. We consider customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to be the contracts with a customer. For each contract, we consider our promise to transfer each distinct product to be the identified performance obligations. Revenue for product sales is recognized at the time of product shipment, as determined by the agreed upon contract shipping terms.

Our Licensing and services revenue is comprised of revenue from our IP core licensing activity, patent monetization activities, design services, and royalty and adopter fee revenue from our standards activities. These activities are complementary to our product sales and help us to monetize our IP associated with our technology and standards. We consider licensing arrangements with our customers and agreements with the standards consortia of which we are a member to be the contract. For each contract, we consider the promise to deliver a license that grants the customer the right to use the IP, as well as any professional services provided under the contract, as distinct performance obligations. We recognize license revenue at the point in time that control of the license transfers to the customer, which is generally upon delivery, or as usage occurs.

We measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services. Variable consideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists primarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on an analysis of historical rebate claims over a period of time considered adequate to account for current pricing and business trends. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their receivable balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do 
not
 have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within Accrued liabilities. Revenue related to licensing and services, which includes HDMI and MHL standards revenue, as well as certain IP licenses, includes variable consideration in the form of usage-based royalties.

We generally provide an assurance warranty that our products will substantially conform to the published specifications for 
twelve
 months from the date of shipment. In some cases, the warranty period 
 may 
be longer than 
twelve
 months. We do 
not
 separately price or sell the assurance warranty. Our liability is limited to either a credit equal to the purchase price or replacement of the defective part. Under the practical expedient provided by ASC 
340,
 we generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would be less than 
one
 year. We record these costs within Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Substantially all of our performance obligations are satisfied within 
twelve
 months.

Table of Contents

Inventories and Cost of Revenue

Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (determined using the 
first
-in, 
first
-out method) or net realizable value. We review and set standard costs quarterly to approximate current actual manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of actual spending over actual costs. The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate excess or obsolete inventory. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining provisions for excess or obsolete products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, projected customer demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. The creation of such provisions results in a write-down of inventory to net realizable value and a charge to Cost of revenue. Lower of cost or net realizable value is based on assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future sales activity and selling prices. Shipping and handling costs are included in Cost of revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally 
three
 to 
seven
 years for equipment and software, and 
one
 to 
five
 years for tooling. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the non-cancelable lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets. We capitalize costs for the fabrication of masks used by our foundry partners to manufacture our products. The capitalized mask costs begin depreciating to Cost of revenue once the products go into production, and depreciation is straight-lined over a 
three
-year period, which is the expected useful life of the mask. Upon disposal of property and equipment, the accounts are relieved of the costs and related accumulated depreciation and amortization, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for recognized gains and losses. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, under which we allocate the purchase price paid for a company to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Determining the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that are based on all available information, including comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. The estimation of the fair values of the intangible assets requires significant judgment and the use of valuation techniques including primarily the income approach. Consideration is given to all relevant factors that might affect the fair value such as estimates of future revenues and costs, present value factors, and the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. We expense acquisition-related costs in the period incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, which consist primarily of property and equipment, amortizable intangible assets, and right-of-use assets, are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment and test the recoverability of such assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts 
 may 
not
 be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset group; (ii) actual 
third
-party valuations; and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar asset groups. If the fair value of the asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections 
 may 
vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.

Valuation of Goodwill

Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are 
not
 individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is 
not
 amortized, but is instead tested for impairment annually during the 
fourth
 quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill 
 may 
not
 be recoverable. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, we make a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than 
not
 that the reporting unit's fair value is less than the carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than 
not
 that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit. The impairment loss, if any, is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, 
no
 further impairment analysis is needed. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, we currently operate as a single reporting unit.

Leases

We account for leases under the terms of ASC 
842,
 "
Leases
," which requires lessees to record assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 
12
 months. Under this guidance, we apply the practical expedient to 
not
 separate lease and non-lease components for all asset classes.

Right-of-use ("ROU") assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do 
not
 provide an implicit rate, we determine the present value of lease payments using an incremental borrowing rate based on information from our commercial bank for an equivalent borrowing and term in the respective region as of the lease commencement date. At inception, we determine if an arrangement is a lease, if it includes options to extend or terminate the lease, and if it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the options. Lease cost, representing lease payments over the term of the lease and any capitalizable direct costs less any incentives received, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as lease expense. We have operating leases for corporate offices, sales offices, research and development facilities, storage facilities, and a data center.

The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. When deemed reasonably certain of exercise, the renewal options are included in the determination of the lease term and lease payment obligation, respectively. For our leases that contain variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, or restrictive covenants, we have concluded that these inputs are 
not
 significant to the determination of the ROU asset and lease liability.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses include costs for compensation and benefits, engineering wafers, depreciation and amortization, licenses and masks, and outside engineering services. These expenditures are for the design of new products, intellectual property cores, processes, packaging, and software solutions. Research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred, with certain licensed technology agreements capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to Research and development expense over their estimated useful lives.

Restructuring

Expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when incurred under ASC 
420,
 “
Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations
,” for everything except severance expenses and vacated leased facilities. Because we have a history of paying severance benefits, the cost of severance benefits associated with a restructuring plan is recorded when such costs are probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with ASC 
712,
 “
Compensation - Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits.
” When leased facilities are vacated, the amount of any ROU asset impairment is calculated in accordance with ASC 
360,
 "
Property, Plant, and Equipment
" and recorded as a part of Restructuring. Expenses from other exit or disposal activities, including the cancellation of software contracts and engineering tools or the abandonment of long-lived assets, are recorded as a part of Restructuring.

Accounting for Income Taxes

We are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. These estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions 
 may 
not
 be known for many years after completion of the applicable year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the difference is expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that in management’s judgment is more-likely-than-
not
 to be recoverable against future taxable income. The determination of a valuation allowance and when it should be released requires complex judgment.

In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, we evaluate both positive and negative evidence that 
 may 
exist and consider whether it is more-likely-than-
not
 that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required.

46

Table of Contents

Our income tax calculations are based on application of the respective U.S. federal, state or foreign tax law
. 
Our tax filings, however, are subject to audit by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more-likely-than-
not
 to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will 
not
 be recognized if it has less than a 
50%
 likelihood of being sustained. To the extent the final tax liabilities are different than the amounts originally accrued, the increases or decreases as well as any interest or penalties are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in U.S. taxable income as a period cost.

Stock-Based Compensation

We estimate the fair value of share-based awards consistent with the provisions of ASC 
718,
 “
Compensation - Stock Compensation
.” We value restricted stock units ("RSUs") restricted stock awards ("RSAs") using the closing market price on the date of grant, and we value stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We have also granted RSUs with a market condition or a performance condition to certain executives. The terms of these grants, including achievement criteria and vesting schedules, are detailed under the heading "
Market-Based and Performance-Based Awards — Grants"
 in 
Note 
10
 - Stock-Based Compensation Plans.
 Our current practice is to issue new shares to satisfy option exercises. For RSUs, we issue new shares when awards vest and 
withhold a portion of these shares on behalf of employees to satisfy the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.

Note

 - Net Income Per Share

We compute basic earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We compute diluted earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period, if applicable. Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs and RSAs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan.

Our calculation of potentially dilutive shares includes the number of shares from our equity awards with market conditions or performance conditions that would be issuable under the terms of such awards at the end of the reporting period. For equity awards with a market condition, the number of shares included in the diluted share count as of the end of each period presented is determined by measuring the achievement of the market condition as of the end of the respective reporting periods. For equity awards with a performance condition, the number of shares that qualified for vesting as of the end of each period presented are included in the diluted share count when the condition for their issuance was satisfied by the end of the respective reporting periods. See "
Note 
10
 - Stock-Based Compensation Plans
" for further discussion of our equity awards with market or performance conditions.

 - Intangible Assets and Goodwill

In connection with our previous acquisitions
,
 we have recorded identifiable intangible assets related to existing technology, customer relationships, and trade name / trademarks, based on guidance for determining fair value under the provisions of ASC 
820,
 "
Fair Value Measurements
." We amortize the intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Additionally, we have entered into license agreements for 
third
-party technology and recorded them as intangible assets. These licenses are being amortized to Research and development expense over their estimated useful lives.

Our review of our strategic long-range plan completed at the end of fiscal 
2024
 concluded that the originally acquired Mirametrix intangible assets had limited future revenue potential due to a decline in customer demand, which we determined was an indicator of impairment. Our assessment of the fair value of these intangible assets concluded that they had been fully impaired as of 
 December 28, 2024, 
and we recorded an impairment charge of $
13.9
 million for fiscal 
2024
 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
No
 impairment charges relating to acquired intangible assets were recorded for fiscal 
2023
 or 
2022.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets. The goodwill balance at 
 December 28, 2024 
is comprised of approximately $
315.4
 million from prior acquisitions. 
No
 impairment charges relating to goodwill were recorded for fiscal 
2024

 - Long-Term Debt

On 
 September 1, 2022, 
we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the 
“2022
 Credit Agreement”), which provides for a 
five
-year secured revolving loan facility with an aggregate principal amount of up to $
350
 million. We intend to use the revolving loan facility for working capital and general corporate purposes.

At our option, the revolving loans accrue interest at a per annum rate based on ranges determined by our consolidated total leverage ratio of either (i) the base rate (as defined in the 
2022
 Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from 
0.25
% to 
1.00
%, or (ii) the adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") for interest periods of 
1,

3
 or 
6
 months plus a margin ranging from 
1.25
% to 
2.00
%. Interest is due and payable in arrears quarterly for loans bearing interest at the base rate and at the end of an interest period (or at each 
three
-month interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than 
three
 months) in the case of loans bearing interest at the adjusted Term SOFR. In addition, we pay a quarterly commitment fee of 
0.20
% on the unused portion of the revolving facility.

The revolving loans under the 
2022
 Credit Agreement 
 may 
be repaid and reborrowed at our discretion, with any remaining outstanding principal amount due and payable on the maturity date of the revolving loan on 
 September 1, 2027. 
At 
 December 28, 2024 
and 
 December 30, 2023, 
we had 
no
 borrowings outstanding under the 
2022
 Credit Agreement, as we paid off the outstanding balance of our revolving loans during the 
third
 quarter of fiscal 
2023.

Interest expense related to our long-term debt is included in Interest expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:

 - Restructuring

In

 September 2024, 
our management commenced an internal restructuring plan ("the

Q3

2024
 Plan"), which includes a global workforce reduction. Under this plan, we have incurred restructuring costs of approximately $
7.6
 million through 
 December 28, 2024. 
The 
Q3

2024
 plan is expected to be largely complete in the 
first
 half of fiscal year 
2025.

In the 
third
 quarter of 
2023,
 our management approved and executed an internal restructuring plan (the 
“Q3

2023
 Plan”), which included a targeted workforce reduction intended to reorganize critical roles and focus skillsets in key growth markets. We incurred restructuring costs of approximately $
5.3
 million and $
2.0
 million, respectively, in fiscal 
2024
 and 
2023.
 Under this plan, approximately $
7.3
 million of total costs have been incurred through 
 December 28, 2024. 
All actions planned under the 
Q3

2023
 plan have been implemented.

In 
 September 2022, 
our management approved and implemented additional contract cancellations and workforce reductions under the 
Q2

2019
 Sales Plan, an internal restructuring plan that our management approved and executed in 
 April 2019. 
The 
Q2

2019
 Sales Plan focused on a restructuring of the global sales organization through cancellation of certain contracts and a workforce reduction. Under the 
Q2

2019
 Sales Plan, we recorded a credit adjustment of approximately $
0.6
 million in fiscal 
2024,
 incurred 
no
 restructuring costs in fiscal 
2023,
 and incurred approximately $
1.0
 million of incremental restructuring costs in fiscal 
2022.
 Under this plan, approximately $
2.5
 million of total expense has been incurred through 
 December 28, 2024. 
All actions planned under the 
Q2

2019
 Sales Plan have been implemented.

Other restructuring activity in the periods presented consisted of expense adjustments on previous plans. Costs and adjustments on restructuring plans are recorded to Restructuring on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The restructuring accrual balance is presented in Accrued liabilities and in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 - Leases

We have operating leases for corporate offices, sales offices, research and development facilities, storage facilities, and a data center, all of which are leased under operating leases that expire at various times through 
2029.

Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than 
1
 year to 
5
 years, some of which include options to extend for up to 
5
 years, and some of which include options to terminate within 
1
 year. The weighted-average remaining lease term was 
3.0
 years and the weighted-average discount rate was 
6.0
% as of 
 December 28, 2024. 
We recorded fixed operating lease expense of $
8.5
 million, $
7.8
 million, and $
7.6
 million, respectively, for fiscal 
2024
, 
2023,

 - Stock-Based Compensation Plans

Employee and Director Stock Options, Restricted Stock, and ESPP Plans

As of 
 December 28, 2024, 
we have 
two
 active equity incentive plans, the 
"2023
 Equity Incentive Plan" (which was adopted in 
2023
 and superseded the 
"2013
 Incentive Plan",
 such that 
no
 additional shares will be granted under the 
2013
 Incentive Plan
) and the 
"2011
 Non-Employee Director Equity Incentive Plan", under which shares remain available for grants to employees and non-employee directors, respectively.
 As of 
 January 10, 2025, 
we registered the 
“2025
 Inducement Equity Plan”, under which shares will be available for grants to new hire employees. 
"Incentive stock options" under Section 
422
 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, restricted stock unit ("RSU"), and restricted stock award ("RSA") grants are part of our equity compensation practices for employees who receive equity grants. Options, RSUs, and RSAs generally vest quarterly over a 
four
-year period beginning on the grant date. The contractual terms of options granted do 
not
 exceed 
ten
 years.

We also maintain the 
2012
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (
"2012
 ESPP"), 
pursuant to which eligible employees 
 may 
contribute through payroll deductions up to 
10
% of base compensation, subject to certain income limits, to purchase shares of our common stock. 
The purchase price of the shares is the lower of 
85
% of the fair market value of the stock at the beginning of each 
six
-month offering period or 
85
% of the fair market value at the end of such period. We have treated the 
2012
 ESPP as a compensatory plan. At 
 December 28, 2024
, a total of 
0.8
 million shares of our common stock were available for future purchases under the 
2012
 ESPP.

At 
 December 28, 2024
, a total of 
6.9
 million shares of our common stock were available for future grants under the 
2023
 Equity Incentive Plan and the 
2011
 Non-Employee Director Equity Incentive Plan. 
The 
2023
 Equity Incentive Plan, 
2011
 Non-Employee Director Equity Incentive Plan, and the 
2025
 Inducement Equity Plan do 
not
 have any fungible share ratio or counting provision
. Shares subject to stock option grants that expire or are canceled, without delivery of such shares, and 
shares subject to performance-based restricted stock units that are 
not
 delivered due to a failure to 
not
 meet the maximum payout threshold, 
generally become available for re-issuance under equity incentive plans.

 million, respectively, for fiscal 
2024
 and 
2023,
 which is reflected in Income tax (benefit) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The income tax benefit related to awards vested or exercised during fiscal 
2024
 was $
1.7
 million. These amounts do 
not
 include the indirect effects of stock-based compensation, which primarily relate to the R&D tax credit. The income tax benefit related to awards vested or exercised during fiscal 
2023
 was $
10.4
 million. The income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation were 
not
 significant for fiscal 
2022,
 as they were offset by an increase in the valuation allowance.

Table of Contents

ESPP and Stock Options

The fair values of the shares expected to be issued under the employee stock purchase plan and of each option award on the date of grant were estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model and the assumptions noted in the following table. 
No
 new stock options were granted during fiscal 
2024,

2023,
 or 
2022.
 The expected volatility of both ESPP shares and stock options is based on the daily historical volatility of our stock price, measured over the ESPP purchase period or the expected term of the option. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury 
zero
-coupon issue with a remaining term closest to the expected term of the option. The expected term is based on historical vested option exercises and includes an estimate of the expected term for options that are fully vested and outstanding. Dividend yield has 
no
 valuation impact, as we have 
not
 paid any cash dividends since inception and do 
not
 intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

The following table summarizes the assumptions used in the valuation of ESPP compensation for the periods presented:

there was 
no
 unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee and director stock options. Compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards is recognized using the straight-line method. We recorde

2.2
 million, and $
1.5

Market-Based and Performance-Based Awards

In 
2022
 through 
2024
, we granted awards of RSUs with either a market condition or a performance condition to certain executives.

Market-Based and Performance-Based Awards — Grants

In fiscal 
2024,

2023,
 and 
2022,
 we granted awards of RSUs with a market condition to certain executives.
 Under the terms of these grants, the RSUs with a market condition vest over a 
three
-year period based on the Company's t
otal shareholder return
 ("TSR") relative to a specified index. For the 
2024
 and 
2023
 grants, the TSR condition is measured relative to the Russell 
3000
 index on 
either the 
third
 anniversary of the grant date, or equally on the first, second, and 
third
 anniversary of the grant date, depending on the executive. For the 
2022
 grants, 
the TSR condition is measured relative to the Russell 
2000
 index
 on the 
third
 anniversary of the grant date
. 
The awards 
 may 
vest at 
250
% or 
200
%, depending on the executive, if the 
75th
 percentile of the market condition is achieved, with 
100
% of the units vesting at the 
55th
 percentile, 
zero
 vesting if relative TSR is below the 
25th
 percentile, and vesting scaling for achievement between the 
25th
 and 
75th
 percentile.

In fiscal 
2024,
 we also granted awards of RSUs with a performance condition to certain executives. Under the terms of these grants, the RSUs with a performance condition will vest if the Company achieves year-over-year revenue growth in excess of an industry benchmark, and the number of shares vested will scale for achievement of year-over-year revenue growth compared to certain targets, with maximum vesting up to 
250
%. The performance condition will be measured annually after each fiscal year-end for

 of the grants beginning in fiscal 
2025
 through the end of fiscal 
2028.
 Vesting of these awards occurs 
13
 months after the end of each measurement period and the entire award cannot be fully earned until 
five
 and a half years from grant date.

In fiscal 
2024,
 we also granted awards of RSUs with a market condition to our new chief executive officer with vesting tied to the Company's stock price appreciation. The number of shares that become eligible to vest can range from 
25
% to 
250
% of the target number of shares, based on the Company's stock price growth over the 
6
-year service period, which ranges from 
25
% to 
200
% stock price growth calculated based on the simple average of the closing Company share price for the trailing 
60
 trading days up to and including the measurement date. 
No
 vesting occurs for stock price growth below 
25
%. Vesting will occur annually after 
3
 years for a portion of the vesting eligible RSUs.

Market-Based and Performance-Based Awards — Vesting

       During fiscal

2024,
 the market condition for the majority of awards granted to certain executives in previous years exceeded the

75th
 percentile of their TSR condition, and these awards vested at

250
% or

200
%, as applicable for the respective executive. One award achieved the

54th
 percentile of its TSR condition and vested at approximately

97
%, while

one
 award did

not
 meet its minimum TSR threshold for vesting. Also during

2024,
 the

second
 tranche of awards granted in fiscal

2021
 and

2022
 with a year-over-year revenue growth performance condition vested at the

200
% level of achievement, as the Company met the maximum year-over-year revenue growth performance criteria as of

 December 31, 2022, 
and the

13
-month vesting period had been met. For the

third
 tranche of these awards, the Company met the year-over-year revenue growth performance criteria at the

116.3
% level of achievement as of

 December 30, 2023.

       During fiscal

2023,
 the market condition for awards granted to certain executives in previous years exceeded the

75th
 percentile of their TSR condition, and applicable tranches of these awards vested at

250
% or

200
% for the respective executives. Also during

2023,
 the

first
 tranche of awards granted in fiscal

2021
 with a year-over-year revenue growth performance condition vested at the

200
% level of achievement, as the Company met the maximum year-over-year revenue growth performance criteria as of

 January 1, 2022, 
and the

13

two
 consecutive trailing

four
-quarter periods as of the end of the respective measurement periods.

Market-Based and Performance-Based Awards — Compensation Expense

For 
our awards with a market condition or a performance condition, we recorded benefits from forfeitures of approximately $
29.0
 million due to executive departures, partially offset by stock compensation expense of approximately $
28.4
 million, in fiscal 
2024.
 We incurred stock-based compensation expense of approximately $
26.4
 million and $
24.0
 million in fiscal years 
2023
 and 
2022
, respectively. 
These amounts are recorded as components of total stock-based compensation. At 
 December 28, 2024, 
there was $
54.4

million
 of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs with a market condition or a performance condition. Awards with a market condition were valued using Monte Carlo simulation models.

The decrease in provision for income taxes in fiscal year 
2024
 compared to fiscal year 
2023
 was primarily due to the release of the US federal valuation allowance in the prior year and the recognition of uncertain tax benefits in the current year.

We updated our evaluation of the valuation allowance position in the United States through 
 December 28, 2024 
and concluded that we should continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets due to insufficient income sources. We will continue to evaluate both positive and negative evidence in future periods to determine if we will realize the deferred tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if sufficient positive evidence exists. We don't have a valuation allowance on a significant portion of our U.S. Federal deferred tax assets or in any foreign jurisdictions as we have concluded that it is more likely than 
not
 that we will realize the net deferred tax assets in the future periods.

At 
 December 28, 2024, 
we had U.S. federal net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards (pretax) of approximately $
6.8
 million which will expire between 
2027
 and 
2031.
 We had state NOL carryforwards (pretax) of approximately $
132.3
 million that substantially all expire at various dates from 
2025
 through 
2041.
 We also had federal credit carryforwards of $
47.2
 million that expire at various dates from 
2035
 through 
2044,
 and $
84.0
 million state credit carryforwards, of which substantially all do 
not
 expire.

Future utilization of federal and state net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
 may 
be limited if cumulative changes to ownership exceed 
50%
 within any 
three
-year period, which has 
not
 occurred through fiscal 
2024.
 However, if there is a significant change in ownership, future tax attribute utilization 
 may 
be limited and NOL carryforwards and/or R&D credits will be reduced to reflect the limitation.

Foreign earnings 
 may 
be subject to withholding taxes in local jurisdictions if they are distributed. At 
 December 28, 2024, 
U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes were 
not
 provided for on a cumulative total of approximately $
3.0
 million of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely.

At 
 December 28, 2024 
and 
 December 30, 2023, 
our unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions were $
29.3
 million and $
61.4
 million, respectively, of which $
26.3
 million and $
58.7
 million, respectively, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate, subject to valuation allowance. As of 
 December 28, 2024 
and 
 December 30, 2023, 
interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits were $
0.4
 million and $
11.3
 million, respectively, which are 
not
 reflected in the table below. We accrue interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in Income tax expense.

0.1
 million of associated interest and penalties could be recognized during the next

 months.

 - Employee Benefit Plans

Qualified Investment Plan

In 
1990,
 we adopted a 
401
(k) tax-deferred savings plan, which provides all employees in the United States who meet certain eligibility requirements with an opportunity to accumulate funds for retirement. Participants 
 may 
contribute up to the amount allowable as a deduction for federal income tax purposes. The plan does 
not
 allow investments in the Company's common stock. The plan allows for the Company to make discretionary matching contributions in cash. We recorded matching contributions of approximately $
2.8
 million, $
3.1
 million, and $
2.8
 million in fiscal years 
2024
, 
2023
, and 
2022
, respectively.

Corporate Incentive Plan

For 
2024
, 
2023
, and 
2022
, the Board of Directors of the Company, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the Corporate Incentive Plan (the “CIP”) for the respective fiscal year. The chief executive officer, other executive officers, and other members of senior management, including vice presidents and director-level employees, together with all other employees of the Company 
not
 on the Company's sales incentive plan are eligible to participate in the CIP. Under the CIP, individual cash incentive payments for the eligible employees will be based both on Company financial performance, as measured by achievement of operating income (before incentive plan accruals) and revenue goals within specified ranges established by the Compensation Committee, and Company performance, as measured by the achievement of personal management objectives. The Compensation Committee determines the performance of the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer and other participants based on the achievement of the management objectives established by the Compensation Committee during the 
first
 quarter of the respective fiscal year. We recorded approximately $
1.6
 million, $
15.0
 million, and $
25.2
 million of expense under the CIP in fiscal 
2024
, 
2023
, and 
2022
, respectively.

Legal Proceedings

On or about 
 December 19, 2018, 
Steven De Jaray, Perienne De Jaray and Darrell Oswald (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) commenced an action against the Company in the Multnomah County Circuit Court of the State of Oregon, in connection with the sale of certain products by the Company to the Plaintiffs in or around 
2008.
 The Plaintiffs alleged the Company violated the Lanham Act, engaged in negligence, fraud, and breach of contract by failing to disclose to the Plaintiffs the export-controlled status of the subject parts. In 
 January 2019, 
we removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Oregon (the “Court”). On 
 May 24, 2023, 
the Plaintiffs filed a 
second
 amended complaint, which added Apex-Micro Manufacturing Corporation (“Apex-Micro”) as a plaintiff and removed the violation of the Lanham Act claim. The Plaintiffs sought damages of $
180
 million, punitive damages, and other remedies. On 
 January 18, 2024, 
the court dismissed the claims against the Company by Ms. De Jaray and Mr. Oswald. The trial for the remaining claims was held from 
 January 30, 2024 
to 
 February 15, 2024. 
On 
 February 13, 2024, 
the Court granted the Company’s Rule 
50
 motion in part and entered judgment in the Company’s favor as to all of Mr. De Jaray’s claims and Apex-Micro’s negligence claims. On 
 February 15, 2024, 
the jury found that the Company was 
not
 liable for all outstanding claims and judgment was entered in favor of the Company. On 
 March 15, 2024, 
Mr. De Jaray and Apex-Micro filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On 
 March 18, 2024, 
Ms. De Jaray filed a separate Notice of Appeal. Ms. De Jaray’s appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute on 
 August 1, 2024. 
In response to Mr. De Jaray and Apex Micro's request for an extension, their appeal opening brief was due 
 October 7, 2024. 
Mr. De Jaray and Apex Micro failed to file their appeal opening brief on 
 October 7
th
. Mr. De Jaray's and Apex Micro's appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute on 
 October 30, 2024.

From time to time, we are exposed to certain additional asserted and unasserted potential claims. We review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and a range of possible losses can be estimated, we then accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and 
 may 
revise estimates.

 - Segment Reporting

ASC 
280,
 Segment Reporting, establishes standards for the manner in which companies report financial information about operating segments, products, services, geographic areas and major customers. Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer.

As of 
 December 28, 2024, 
we have determined that the Company operates in a 
single
 operating and reportable segment: the core Lattice business, which includes silicon-based and silicon-enabling products, evaluation boards, development hardware, and related intellectual property licensing, services, and sales. Our CODM reviews operating results and financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance.

The following table sets forth the Company’s revenue, significant expenses, and net income by its single operating and reportable segment:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (the Company) as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Inventory Valuation

Description of the Matter

The Company's net inventory totaled $103.4 million as of December 28, 2024. As explained in “Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” within the consolidated financial statements, the Company records inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and writes down inventories to net realizable value if it is obsolete or if quantities are in excess of projected customer demand.

Auditing management’s inventory excess and obsolescence reserves was challenging because the calculation of the estimate is complex as it considers a number of factors that are affected by market and economic conditions, such as customer demand and product lifecycle.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over the calculation of excess and obsolete inventory, including the determination and application of the assumptions used to estimate the excess and obsolescence reserve.

Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the assumptions and the underlying data used in management's excess and obsolete inventory assessment. We evaluated inventory levels compared to projected customer demand, historical sales, and product lifecycle. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the changes in inventory valuation that would result from changes in assumptions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Lattice Semiconductor Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants On Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

In connection with the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer (previously our Interim Chief Financial Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of December 28, 2024. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that we accumulate and communicate correct information to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer (previously our Interim Chief Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer (previously our Interim Chief Financial Officer) have concluded that our disclosure controls are effective as of December 28, 2024.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(ii)

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

(iii)

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer (previously our Interim Chief Financial Officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)
. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 28, 2024, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting and has issued its opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which appears on page 
63
 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
