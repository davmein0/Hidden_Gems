Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These involve estimates, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. We use words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” "possible," “predict,” “projects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “continue,” “ongoing,” “future,” “potential,” and similar words or phrases to identify forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: our target or expected financial performance and our ability to achieve those results; future impacts of the ongoing military conflicts between Ukraine and Russia, and in the Middle East, and the outbreak of new, or expansion of current, military conflicts or terrorism; the impact of any continuing trade or travel restrictions or increasing tariffs on the export and import of products between the U.S. and China; the impact of increasing trade restrictions or tariffs on the export and import of products between the U.S. and other countries; the impact of any deterioration in relations between Taiwan and China, and other factors affecting military, political, or economic conditions in Taiwan or elsewhere in Asia; the impact of tariffs, trade sanctions, license requirements or similar actions on our suppliers and customers; the impact of inflationary pressures; the effects of climate change and disruptive natural disasters on us, our suppliers, and our consumers, including as a result of actions by governments, businesses, and consumers in response; our business strategy; our opportunities to increase our addressable market; our expectations and strategies regarding market trends and opportunities, including market drivers such as wireless and wireline communications infrastructure deployments, data center servers and networking equipment, client computing platforms, industrial Internet of Things, factory automation, robotics, automotive electronics, smart homes, prosumers, and other applications; our expectations regarding the growth of AI-related revenue; our beliefs about who we may compete with and whether we are differentiated from those competitors, as well as their potential capabilities; our expectations regarding our customer base and the impacts of our customers’ actions on our business; our expectations regarding both new and existing product offerings; our gross margin growth and our strategies to achieve gross margin growth and other financial results; our future investments in research and development; our ability to take advantage of the process technology development efforts of semiconductor foundries and apply those technologies when they become most economically beneficial to us and to our customers; the impact of changing foundries or OSATs (as defined below) or their failure to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products at acceptable yields, as well as the impact of problems with other subcontractors or distributors; the impact if we are unable to detect product defects; the impact if our insurance proves to be inadequate to resolve claims against us; whether we will experience seasonality or cyclicality and the resulting effects on our business; our expectations about our patent portfolio, including the expiration of patents, whether, when and where we will make future filings, and the value of the patents and associated licensing agreements generally and to our business, as well as risks arising from the licensing and sale of our patents; our ability to attract and retain personnel and their importance to our performance; future financial results or accounting treatments; our judgments involved in accounting matters, including revenue recognition, inventories and cost of revenue, and income taxes; actions we may take regarding the design and continued effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; our use of cash; our beliefs regarding the adequacy of our liquidity, capital resources and facilities; the impact of our debt on our future operating and financial performance, as well as the impact if we breach a loan covenant; whether we will consider and act upon acquisition opportunities to extend our product, technology and product offerings and the impact of such opportunities on our business; our expectations regarding taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits, and tax adjustments and allowances; whether we will pursue future stock repurchases and how any future repurchases will be funded; the future price volatility of our stock and the effects of that volatility; our ability to prevent and respond to information technology system failures, security breaches and incidents, cyberattacks or fraud, and the occurrence and impact of such cybersecurity incidents; the costs of mitigating cybersecurity risks; the impact of artificial intelligence (“AI”), including our expectations regarding our AI-related revenue; the impact of laws and regulations addressing privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity and our ability to comply with the same; our ability to comply with other laws and regulations, the costs of such compliance, and costs incurred if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations; our beliefs regarding legal or administrative proceedings; and impacts of global pandemics, epidemics, and other public health matters and actions of governments, businesses, and individuals in response to these situations.

These forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements expressed in the forward-looking statements. The key factors, among others, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include global economic conditions and uncertainty, including as a result of trade-related restrictions or tariffs; inflationary pressures; the effect of any downturn in the economy on capital markets and credit markets; the concentration of our sales in certain end markets, particularly as it relates to the concentration of our sales in the Asia Pacific region; market acceptance and demand for our existing and new products; market and technology trends; our ability to achieve yield and quality improvements; our ability to protect, license and sell our intellectual property; shortages or increased costs in our supply chain; any disruption of our distributors or distribution channels; the impact of competitive products and pricing, especially by companies with great resources than us; unanticipated warranty claims; our failure to prevent or adequately respond to information technology system failures, security breaches and incidents, cyberattacks, or fraud; physical and transition disruptions and costs associated with climate change; unanticipated taxation requirements or positions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority; unanticipated effects of tax reform; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; the sufficiency of our insurance coverage; the impact of our outstanding indebtedness on our strategic flexibility, liquidity and results of operations; the impact of strategic transactions; unexpected impacts of accounting guidance; unfavorable results of legal proceedings; and the macroeconomic climate and effects of global military conflicts and actions of governments, businesses, and individuals in response to these situations. In addition, actual results are subject to other risks and uncertainties that relate more broadly to our overall business, including those more fully described herein and that are otherwise described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including, but not limited to, the items discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

You should not unduly rely on forward-looking statements because our actual results could differ materially from those expressed by us. In addition, any forward-looking statement applies only as of the date of this filing. We do not plan to, and undertake no obligation to, update any forward-looking statements to reflect new information or new events, circumstances or developments, or otherwise.
