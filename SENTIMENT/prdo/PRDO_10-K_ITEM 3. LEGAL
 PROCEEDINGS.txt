ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOC
KHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market 
(“Nasdaq”)
 under the symbol “PRDO”.

The closing price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq on February 11, 2025 was $28.39 per share. As of February 11, 2025, there were approximately 94 holders of record of our common stock, including The Depository Trust Company, which holds shares of our common stock on behalf of an indeterminate number of beneficial owners.

Our common stock transfer agent and registrar is Computershare Trust Company, N.A. They can be contacted at P.O. Box# 43078, Providence, RI 02940-3078 or at their website 
www.computershare.com/investor
.

In 2024, the Company's Board of Directors continued to implement its dividend policy. Under this policy, the Board plans to distribute dividends on a quarterly basis. The declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Any decision to pay future cash dividends will be made by the Board of Directors and depend on the Company’s available retained earnings, financial condition, the impact of changing laws and regulations, economic conditions, general business conditions, capital spending plans, the anticipated effect of a dividend payment on our financial condition, and other factors the Board of Directors may consider relevant. In addition to quarterly dividends, the Company reinvests earnings in our operations to promote future growth and, from time to time, executes repurchases of shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program discussed below. The repurchase of shares of our common stock reduces the amount of cash available to pay cash dividends to our common stockholders.

On February 20, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new stock repurchase program for up to $50.0 million which commenced March 1, 2024 and expires September 30, 2025. The new stock repurchase program replaced the previous stock repurchase program. The other terms of the new stock repurchase program are consistent with the Company’s previous stock repurchase program.

During 2024, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our common stock for approximately $6.8 million at an average price of $17.60 per share under the Company’s current stock repurchase program. The timing of purchases and the number of shares repurchased under the program are determined by the Company’s management and depend on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume and other general market and economic conditions, its assessment of alternative uses of capital, regulatory requirements and other factors. Repurchases will be made in open market transactions, including block purchases, conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act as well as may be made pursuant to trading plans established under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, which would permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase shares and the Company may, in its discretion, begin, suspend or terminate repurchases at any time, without any prior notice. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $47.1 million was available under the stock repurchase program.

The Board of Directors approved the aforementioned stock repurchase programs believing it advantageous to the Company and its stockholders to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time at prices below what the Board of Directors believed to be the intrinsic value of the Company’s common stock.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The discussion below contains “forward-looking statements,” as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that reflect our current expectations regarding our future growth, results of operations, cash flows, performance and business prospects and opportunities, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. We have tried to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” ”will,” “continue to,” “focused on” and similar expressions, but these words are not the exclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements. These statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including, but not limited to, those matters discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K that could cause our actual growth, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, performance, business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update such factors or to publicly announce the results of any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events, developments, or changed circumstances or for any other reason.

As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” “Perdoceo” and “PEC” refer to Perdoceo Education Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. The terms “institution” and “university” refer to an individual, branded, for-profit educational institution, owned by us and including its campus locations. The term “campus” refers to an individual main or branch campus operated by one of our institutions.

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
(“MD&A”)
 should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The MD&A is intended to help investors understand the results of operations, financial condition and present business environment. The MD&A is organized as follows:

OVERVIEW

Perdoceo’s accredited academic institutions offer a quality postsecondary education to a diverse student population, with fully online, campus-based and hybrid learning programs. The Company’s academic institutions – Colorado Technical University (“
CTU
”), the American InterContinental University System (“
AIUS
” or “
AIU System
”) and University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences ("
USAHS"
) – provide degree programs from the associate through doctoral level as well as non-degree seeking and professional development programs. Our academic institutions offer students industry-relevant and career-focused academic programs that are designed to meet the educational needs of today’s busy adults. CTU and AIUS continue to show innovation in higher education, advancing personalized learning technologies like their intellipath® learning platform and using data analytics and technology to serve and educate students while enhancing overall learning and academic experiences. USAHS is among the nation's reputable universities offering graduate health sciences degrees, primarily in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech language therapy and nursing, as well as continuing education programs. Perdoceo's academic institutions are committed to providing quality education that closes the gap between learners who seek to advance their careers and employers needing a qualified workforce.

Our reporting segments are determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board 
(“FASB”)
 Accounting Standards Codification 
(“ASC”)
 Topic 280 – 
Segment Reporting
 and are based upon how the Company analyzes performance and makes decisions. Each segment represents a postsecondary education provider that offers a variety of academic programs. We organize our business across three reporting segments: CTU, AIUS and USAHS.

See Note 18 “
Segment Reporting
” for a description of each of our current reporting segments along with revenues, operating income and total assets by reporting segment.

Regulatory Environment and Political Uncertainty

As indicated in “
Scrutiny of the For-Profit Postsecondary Education Sector
” section, the for-profit industry is scrutinized by various policymakers, agencies and interest groups. Congressional hearings and roundtable discussions were previously held regarding certain aspects of the education industry, including issues surrounding student debt as well as publicly reported student outcomes that may be used as part of an institution’s recruiting and admissions practices, and reports were issued that are highly critical of for-profit

46

colleges and universities. Many of the most highly criticized institutions have been closed now for several years. See “
Scrutiny of the For-Profit Postsecondary Education Sector
” for additional information on this matter.

The November 2024 federal elections resulted in a new President and Congress. We cannot predict the actions that the new Administration or Congress may take or their effect on the higher education sector. The new Congress or Administration may delay, block, modify, or eliminate certain Title IV and other regulations applicable to higher education institutions. In addition, the new Administration may interpret, apply, and enforce Title IV and other regulations in a manner different from current Department guidance and practice. We expect to continue to need to operate nimbly, making necessary changes to the extent possible to comply with new rules or interpretations as well as new interpretations of existing rules.

We encourage you to review Item 1, “Business,” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” to learn more about our highly regulated industry and related risks and uncertainties.

Note Regarding Non-GAAP measures

We believe it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain significant and non-cash items as a means to understand the performance of our core business. As a general matter, we use non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP to help analyze the performance of our core business, assist with preparing the annual operating plan, and measure performance for some forms of compensation. In addition, we believe that non-GAAP financial information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze our historical results and to provide estimates of future performance.

We believe certain non-GAAP measures allow us to compare our current operating results with respective historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry because it does not give effect to potential differences caused by items we do not consider reflective of underlying operating performance. We believe the items we are adjusting for are operating expenses which are not reflective of our underlying business. In evaluating the use of non-GAAP measures, investors should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments presented below. Our presentation of non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by expenses that are unusual, non-routine or non-recurring. A non-GAAP measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, operating income, earnings per diluted share, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with and reported under GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of our liquidity.

Non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in a reconciliation to respective GAAP financial measures, provide an additional way of viewing the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the respective financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.

2024 Review

During the year ended December 31, 2024 ("
current year
"), our academic institutions continued to execute on our goal of changing lives through education and preparing learners for job skills necessary in today’s world. The positive student enrollment results we experienced as of the end of the current year demonstrated the execution on our strategy of prioritizing student experiences and academic outcomes, that we believe, will support sustainable and responsible growth.

On December 2, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of the University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences ("
USAHS
"). USAHS is among the nation's reputable universities offering graduate health sciences degrees, primarily in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech language therapy and nursing, as well as continuing education programs. Founded in 1979, USAHS educates students through its network of campuses in San Marcos, California; St. Augustine and Miami, Florida; and Austin and Dallas, Texas and through its online programs. This strategic acquisition allows us to diversify and significantly expand our academic offerings into the health sciences field, broadening our reach and community impact.

Total student enrollments increased 20.0% at December 31, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023, with both CTU and AIUS contributing to this increase, along with the USAHS acquisition. CTU's total student enrollments increased 8.1% as compared to the prior year end, driven by student enrollment growth within our corporate engagement programs as well as continued improvement in prospective student interest levels, student retention and student engagement. Total student enrollments increased 11.8% at AIUS for the current year end as compared to the prior year end as AIUS' total student enrollment comparability had continued to improve through the current year since reverting to normalized levels of operations at the end of 2023.

We remain focused on further enhancing and supporting student retention and engagement, while making selective investments in student technology, including exploring AI based solutions, and leveraging data analytics to identify and engage with prospective students who are most likely to succeed at one of our academic institutions. We also continued to experience increased efficiencies within our student enrollment and onboarding processes that have been supported by the use of data analytics and technology and we have increased training and development within our admissions and enrollment teams.

Lastly, we remained focused on investing in and improving processes that support our corporate engagement programs.

47

We expect the high levels of student retention and student engagement we experienced in 2024, as well as the prospective student interest experienced in the latter half of 2024, to continue into 2025. While we may see quarterly variability in revenue and student enrollment trends, our assumption is that the impact from the Department student loan initiatives that have ended or are expected to change or end in 2025 will mostly be offset with organic improvements in student retention, student engagement and higher levels of prospective student interest for our academic programs, including growth in corporate engagements. Full year revenue is expected to be higher for 2025 primarily due to the USAHS acquisition as well as growth in revenue and student enrollments within CTU and AIUS.

Financial Highlights

Revenue for the current year decreased by 4.0% or $28.7 million as compared to the prior year, resulting from a decrease in revenue for CTU of 2.6% or $12.0 million and a decrease for AIUS of 11.1% or $26.8 million, which more than offset the revenue of $10.0 million from the USAHS acquisition in December of 2024. The decrease in revenue at CTU was mainly due to simplification of professional development program offerings. Excluding the impact from the simplification of professional development program offerings, 2024 revenue at CTU experienced organic growth. Strong underlying student retention and engagement and an increase in student enrollment from corporate engagements fully offset the negative impact of fewer revenue-earning days during the full year and resulted in this organic revenue growth. The decrease within AIUS was driven by a lag impact on revenue through the first three quarters of 2024 of the operational changes undertaken during 2023, which more than offset the revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 for AIUS.

Operating income for the current year increased to $174.3 million as compared to operating income of $150.4 million in the prior year. The increase in operating income for the current year was a result of decreased operating expenses, primarily in the areas of administrative, asset impairment, admissions and academics expenses, which more than offset the decrease in revenue during the current year as compared to the prior year.

The Company believes it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain significant and non-cash items, as a means to understand the performance of its operations. Adjusted operating income was $192.2 million for the current year as compared to $174.9 million for the prior year.

Year Ended December 31, 2024 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2023

Revenue

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 ("
current year
") decreased 4.0%, or $28.7 million, primarily due to decreases in revenue from both CTU and AIUS. The decline at AIUS was attributed to the delayed impact on revenue through the first three quarters of 2024 from operational changes made in the previous year. Typically, total student enrollment balances at the end of any given quarter have a delayed effect on revenue in the following quarter. CTU’s decline was driven by adjustments to our professional development program offerings. The current year's revenue benefited from the acquisition completed on December 2, 2024, which was not included in the full comparative period of the prior year.

The general and administrative expense for the current year decreased by 7.8% or $31.0 million, compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower administrative, admissions and advertising and marketing expenses.

Administrative expense for the current year decreased by 11.9% or $20.3 million as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by operational efficiencies within our academic institutions and decreased legal fees within Corporate and Other for the current year.

Admissions expense decreased by 10.5% or $9.6 million as compared to the prior year. The current year improvement was primarily driven by decreased expenses within both CTU and AIUS as a result of operational changes made during the prior year.

The advertising and marketing expense for the current year decreased by 1.6% or $1.6 million as compared to the prior year, which was driven by adjustments made to our marketing processes to identify prospective student interest.

Bad debt expense remained relatively consistent with a slight increase of 1.5% or $0.5 million for the current year as compared to the prior year. We regularly evaluate our reserve rates, which includes a quarterly update of our analysis of historical student receivable collectability based on the most recent data available and a review of current known factors which we believe could affect future collectability of our student receivables, such as the number of students that do not complete the financial aid process. We continue to expect quarterly fluctuations in bad debt expense.

Operating Income

Operating income for the current year increased by 15.8% or $23.8 million as compared to the prior year. The current year improvement was supported by lower operating expenses across most categories which more than offset the decrease in revenue as compared to the prior year. Additionally, asset impairment expense decreased by $9.8 million as compared to the prior year which benefited the current year comparison.

Provision for Income Taxes

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a tax provision of $53.9 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 26.7% as compared to a tax provision of $44.5 million, with an effective rate of 23.1% for the prior year. The prior year provision includes a $4.5 million favorable adjustment related to the tax benefits associated with a previously disclosed prior year ordinary loss attributable to the stock of a worthless subsidiary, which decreased the 2023 effective tax rate by 2.4%.

For the full year 2025, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 25.5% and 26.5%.

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Total student enrollments represent all students who are active as of the last day of the reporting period. Active students are defined as those students who are considered in attendance by participating in class related activities during the previous two weeks of the most recent academic term. Total student enrollments do not include learners participating in: a) non-degree seeking and professional development programs, and b) degree seeking, non-Title IV, self-paced programs at our universities.

Year Ended December 31, 2024 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2023

CTU. 
Revenue for the current year decreased by 2.6% or $12.0 million as compared to the prior year. This decline was mainly due to simplification of professional development program offerings at CTU. Excluding the impact from the simplification of professional development program offerings, 2024 revenue at CTU experienced organic growth. Strong underlying student retention and engagement and an increase in student enrollment from corporate engagements fully offset the negative impact of fewer revenue-earning days during the full year and resulted in this organic revenue growth. CTU's total student enrollments increased by 8.1% as of December 31, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. This increase was driven by student enrollment growth within our corporate engagement programs as well as continued improvement in prospective student interest levels, student retention and student engagement. CTU's academic calendar may impact the comparability of revenue-earning days and enrollment results in any given quarter, with the impact on revenue and total student enrollments not necessarily having the same magnitude or directional impact.

Current year operating income for CTU increased by 18.9% or $27.3 million as compared to the prior year. The improvement in operating income was driven by lower operating expenses across most categories, partially due to right-sizing of the cost structure to align with more simplified professional development offerings, which more than offset the declines in revenue.

AIUS. 
Revenue for the current year decreased by 11.1% or $26.8 million as compared to the prior year. This decline was driven by a lag impact through the first three quarters of 2024 from the operational changes made during the latter half of 2023. AIUS' total student enrollments increased by 11.8% as of  December 31, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by the return to normalized operating levels starting in late 2023, which contributed to increasing student enrollments throughout 2024.

Current year operating income for AIUS decreased by 20.1% or $9.1 million as compared to the prior year, driven by the  revenue decline mentioned above which was only partially offset with decreased operating expenses.

USAHS. 
Revenue for the current year was approximately $10.0 million starting from the acquisition date of December 2, 2024. USAHS reported an operating loss of approximately $2.6 million for the fourth quarter partially driven by amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets.

Corporate and Other.
 This category includes unallocated costs that are incurred on behalf of the entire company. Total Corporate and Other operating loss for the current year improved by 21.4% or $8.3 million as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of lower legal expenses.

SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe require management’s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 2 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies.

Revenue Recognition

Description
: Our revenue, which is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our universities, is generally segregated into two categories: (1) tuition and fees, and (2) other. Tuition and fees represent costs to our students for educational services provided by our universities and are reflected net of scholarships and tuition discounts. Our universities charge tuition and fees at varying amounts and bill students a single charge that covers tuition, certain fees and required program materials,

52

such as textbooks and supplies, which we treat as a single performance obligation. Generally, we bill student tuition at the beginning of each academic term for our degree programs and recognize the tuition as revenue on a straight-line basis over the academic term. As part of a student’s course of instruction, certain fees, such as technology fees and graduation fees, are billed separately to students. These fees are generally earned over the applicable term and are not considered separate performance obligations. We generally bill student tuition upon enrollment for our non-degree professional development programs and recognize the tuition as revenue on a straight-line basis over the length of the offering.

Assumptions and judgment
: Revenue recognition includes assumptions and significant judgments including determination of the appropriate portfolios to assess for meeting the criteria to recognize revenue under ASC Topic 606 as well as the assessment of collectability. We analyze revenue recognition on a portfolio approach under ASC Topic 606. Significant judgment is used in determining the appropriate portfolios to assess for meeting the criteria to recognize revenue under ASC Topic 606. We have determined that all of our students can be grouped into one portfolio. Based on our past experience, students at different universities, in different programs or with different funding all behave similarly. Enrollment agreements all contain similar terms, refund policies are similar across all institutions and students work with the university to obtain some type of funding, for example, Title IV Program funds, Veterans Administration funds, military funding, employer tuition assistance or self-pay. We have significant historical data for our students which allows us to analyze collectability. We do not expect that revenue earned for the portfolio is significantly different as compared to revenue that would be earned if we were to assess each student contract separately.

Significant judgment is also required to assess collectability, particularly as it relates to students seeking funding under Title IV Programs. Because students are required to provide documentation, and in some cases extensive documentation, to the Department to be eligible and approved for funding, the timeframe for this process can sometimes span between 90 to 120 days. We monitor the progress of students through the eligibility and approval process and assess collectability for the portfolio each reporting period to monitor that the collectability threshold is met.

These assumptions and significant judgments are based upon our interpretation of accounting guidance and historical experience. Although management believes these assumptions and significant judgments to be reasonable, actual amounts may differ if historical experience is not reflective of future results.

Impact if actual results differ from assumptions and judgment: 
If actual performance is not consistent with historical experience in regards to our assessment of collectability, our revenue recognition may be materially different than what was originally recorded.

Allowance for Credit Losses

Description:
 We extend unsecured credit to a portion of the students who are enrolled at our academic institutions for tuition and certain other educational costs. Based upon past experience and judgment, we establish an allowance for credit losses with respect to student receivables which we estimate will ultimately not be collectible. As such, our results from operations only reflect the amount of revenue that is estimated to be reasonably collectible. Our standard student receivable allowance is based on an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for student receivables. Our estimation methodology considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors that, based on our collection experience, we believe have an impact on our repayment risk and ability to collect student receivables. Changes in the trends in any of these factors may impact our estimate of the allowance for credit losses. These factors include, but are not limited to: internal repayment history, changes in the current economic, legislative or regulatory environments, internal cash collection forecasts and the ability to complete the federal financial aid process with the student. These factors are monitored and assessed on a regular basis. Overall, our allowance estimation process for student receivables is validated by trending analysis and comparing estimated and actual performance.

Assumptions and judgment:
 Management makes a range of assumptions to determine what is believed to be the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses. Management determines a reasonable and supportable forecast based on the expectation of future conditions over a supportable forecast period as described above, as well as qualitative adjustments based on current and future conditions that may not be fully captured in the historical modeling factors described above. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change.

Impact if actual results differ from assumptions and judgment
: We monitor our collections and write-off experience to assess whether or not adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary. Changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the collection of our student receivables, as noted above, or modifications to our collection practices, and other related policies may impact our estimate of our allowance for credit losses and our results from operations.

A one percentage point change in our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of gross earned student receivables as of December 31, 2024 would have resulted in a change in pretax income of $0.7 million during the year then ended.

Because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from Title IV Programs, any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under Title IV Programs, or the ability of our students or institutions to participate in Title IV Programs, would likely have a material impact on the realizability of our receivables.

53

Goodwill Impairment

Description:
 Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases. Goodwill often involves estimates based on third-party valuations, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Under ASC Topic 350, we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when an event or other circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value, by applying a fair-value-based test. In making this assessment we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude based on the qualitative assessment that goodwill may be impaired, we then perform a quantitative one-step impairment test, and an impairment loss would be recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the goodwill. Any subsequent increases in goodwill would not be recognized on the consolidated financial statements.

Assumptions and judgment:
 During the current year, we performed a qualitative assessment for the annual review of goodwill balances for impairment. Management first considered events and circumstances, including business trends and current operating performance, that may affect the fair value of the reporting unit to determine whether it was necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. Management focused on the significant inputs utilized in the most recent quantitative assessment and any events or circumstances that could affect the significant inputs, including, but not limited to, financial performance compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods, legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, political, business or other factors, and industry and market considerations, such as a deteriorating operating environment or increased competition.

When performing a quantitative assessment for the annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results and cash flows, market assumptions and/or comparative market multiple methods. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, relative market share, new student interest, student retention, future expansion or contraction expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes do reflect improvements relative to recent historical periods with respect to, among other things, modest revenue growth and operating margins. Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved. The failure of one of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge. Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. In addition to cash flow estimates, our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Impact if actual results differ from assumptions and judgment: 
Changes in these qualitative and quantitative factors, as well as downturns in economic or business conditions, could have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of our reporting units in relation to their respective carrying values of goodwill and could result in an impairment loss affecting our consolidated financial statements as a whole. Generally, an impairment loss would reduce our net income for the reporting period being presented, and proportionally reduce the value of the assets and equity reflected on our balance sheet.

We did not record any goodwill impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and have $258.0 million and $241.2 million of goodwill as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Income Taxes

Description
: We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax laws are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, significant judgments and interpretations are required in determining our income tax provisions (benefits) and evaluating our uncertain tax positions.

We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 
– Income Taxes
. Topic 740 requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the income tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Topic 740 also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.

Assumptions and judgment:
 In establishing a provision for income tax expense or a liability for an uncertain tax position, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws

54

may be subject to review/adjudication by the court systems in the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit.

Impact if actual results differ from assumptions and judgment: 
Although we believe the judgments and estimates used are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to changes in tax liability that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate.

Business Combinations

Description
: We account for business combinations in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805 – 
Business Combinations.
 Paragraph 805-20-30-1 states that the acquirer shall measure the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values.

Assumptions and judgment:
 Allocating the purchase price for a business combination requires the Company to identify and estimate the fair values of various assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Management is responsible for determining the appropriate valuation model and estimated fair values, and in doing so, considers a number of factors, including information provided by an outside valuation advisor. Management bases the fair value of assets, including identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. The inputs and assumptions used in the valuations are considered level 3 inputs.

Impact if actual results differ from assumptions and judgment:
 Changes in any qualitative and quantitative factors, could have a significant impact on the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed and could result in a change to the purchase accounting and any future expense associated with acquired assets.

LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of December 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale short-term investments 
(“cash balances”)
 totaled $591.5 million. Restricted cash as of December 31, 2024 was $22.6 million and primarily relates to a letter of credit USAHS is required to maintain with the Department of Education. Our cash flows from operating activities have historically been adequate to fulfill our liquidity requirements. We have historically financed our operating activities, organic growth and acquisitions primarily through cash generated from operations and existing cash balances. We generated cash in 2024 as a result of improved operating performance and expect to continue to do so in 2025. We anticipate that we will be able to satisfy the cash requirements associated with, among other things, our working capital needs, capital expenditures, lease commitments and quarterly dividends payments through at least the next 12 months primarily with cash generated by operations and existing cash balances.

We maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy that focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet and adequate liquidity, while (i) investing in organic projects at our universities, in particular technology-related initiatives which are designed to benefit our students, as well as real estate updates, and (ii) evaluating diverse strategies to enhance stockholder value, including acquisitions, quarterly dividend payments and share repurchases. Ultimately, our goal is to deploy resources in a way that drives long term stockholder value while supporting and enhancing the academic value of our institutions.

On February 20, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new stock repurchase program for up to $50.0 million which commenced March 1, 2024 and expires September 30, 2025. The new stock repurchase program replaced the previous stock repurchase program. The timing of purchases and the number of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the Company’s management and will depend on a variety of factors including stock price, trading volume and other general market and economic conditions, its assessment of alternative uses of capital, regulatory requirements and other factors.

The Board of Directors approved the aforementioned stock repurchase programs believing it advantageous to the Company and its stockholders to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time at prices below what the Board of Directors believed to be the intrinsic value of the Company’s common stock.

 The discussion above reflects management’s expectations regarding liquidity; however, as a result of the significance of the Title IV Program funds received by our students, we are highly dependent on these funds to operate our business. Any reduction in the level of Title IV funds that our students are eligible to receive or any impact on timing or our ability to receive Title IV Program funds, or any requirement to post a significant letter of credit to the Department, may have a significant impact on our operations and our financial condition. In addition, our financial performance is dependent on the level of student enrollments which could be impacted by external factors. See Item 1A, “
Risk Factors
.”

55

Sources and Uses of Cash

Operating Cash Flows

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $161.6 million and $112.0 million, respectively. The increase in cash flow from operations as compared to the prior year is primarily driven by the increase in operating income as compared to the prior year as well as a negative working capital timing impact on the prior year operating cash flows.

Our primary source of cash flows from operating activities is tuition collected from our students. Our students derive the ability to pay tuition costs through the use of a variety of funding sources, including, among others, federal loan and grant programs, state grant programs, private loans and grants, institutional payment plans, private and institutional scholarships and cash payments. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 77% and 76% of our institutions’ aggregate cash receipts from tuition payments came from Title IV Program funding. This percentage differs from the Title IV Program percentage calculated under the 90-10 Rule due to the treatment of certain funding types and certain student level limitations on what and how much to count as prescribed under the rule.

For further discussion of Title IV Program funding and other funding sources for our students, see Item 1, “
Business - Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation.
”

Our primary uses of cash to support our operating activities include, among other things, cash paid and benefits provided to our employees for services, to vendors for products and services, to lessors for rents and operating costs related to leased facilities, to suppliers for textbooks and other institution supplies, and to federal, state and local governments for income and other taxes.

Investing Cash Flows	

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, net cash flows used in investing activities totaled $107.8 million and $88.5 million, respectively.

Purchases and Sales of Available-for-Sale Investments.
 Purchases and sales of available-for-sale investments resulted in a net cash inflow of $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to a net cash outflow of $76.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Business acquisition. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company completed the USAHS acquisition and made total initial cash payments of $137.8 million.

Capital Expenditures.
 Capital expenditures decreased to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Capital expenditures represented approximately 0.7% and 0.9% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the year ending December 31, 2025, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 2.0% of revenue.

Financing Cash Flows

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, net cash flows used in financing activities totaled $41.1 million and $23.4 million, respectively.

Payments of employee tax associated with stock compensation. 
Payments of employee tax associated with stock compensation were $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Repurchase of stock. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 0.4 million shares of our common stock for approximately $6.8 million at an average price of $17.60 per share as compared to 0.5 million shares of common stock repurchased for $8.3 million at an average price of $15.38 per share for the year ended December 31, 2023. Repurchases of stock during 2024 and 2023 were funded by cash generated from operating activities and existing cash balances. See Part II, Item 5 for more information.

Release of cash held in escrow
. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we released $0.3 million and $1.0 million of escrow associated with acquisitions.

Payments of cash dividends and dividend equivalents
. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company made dividend payments of $31.7 million and $14.4 million, respectively.

Principal payments for finance leases and failed sale leaseback. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company made payments of $0.4 million for finance leases and $0.7 million for a failed sale leaseback, both related to the acquisition of USAHS.

Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2024, future minimum cash payments due under contractual obligations for our non-cancelable operating and finance lease arrangements were $74.4 million and $18.5 million, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately $11.1 million for

56

operating leases and $6.3 million for finance leases are due within the next 12 months. Lastly, undiscounted future rental payments associated with a build to suit arrangement that is reflected as construction financing as of December 31, 2024 amount to $158.4 million over the 25 year lease term. Payments will begin upon lease commencement in January 2025. These future minimum cash payments reflect base rent and other fixed lease-related costs identified in the lease agreements but excludes variable costs such as common area maintenance payments and taxes, as these amounts are undeterminable at this time and may vary based on future circumstances. We lease most of our administrative and educational facilities under non-cancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through 2049.

As of December 31, 2024, we were not a party to any off-balance sheet financing or contingent payment arrangements, nor do we have any unconsolidated subsidiaries.

The increases in these assets and liability categories are driven by the USAHS acquisition.

Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. 
The decrease in total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments is primarily due to payments associated with a business acquisition and dividend payments, which were mostly offset with cash from operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 4 “

” to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that may affect us.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT
IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to financial market risks, primarily changes in interest rates. We use various techniques to manage our interest rate risk. We have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments, and believe the risk related to cash equivalents and available for sale investments is limited due to the adherence to our investment policy, which focuses on capital preservation and liquidity. In addition, we use asset managers who conduct initial and ongoing credit analyses on our investment portfolio and monitor that investments are in compliance with our investment policy. Despite the investment risk mitigation strategies

57

we employ, we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and may experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline.

Interest Rate Exposure

Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell investments that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2024, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in average interest rates applicable to our investments or borrowings would not have a material impact on our future earnings, fair values or cash flows.

Our financial instruments are recorded at their fair values as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in interest rates applicable to our investments or borrowings is not significant.

ITEM 9A. CONTROL
S AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We completed an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“
Report
”) under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “
Exchange Act
”). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that (i) the information required to be disclosed by us in this Report was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms provided by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“
SEC
”), and (ii) the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Scope of Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

Management has excluded the acquisition of University of St. Augustine ("
USAHS
") in its evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. USAHS was not material to consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 and was approximately 1.5% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 18% of total assets as of December 31, 2024, when excluding acquired goodwill and intangible assets.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected.

These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all

58

potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Based upon the evaluation under the framework contained in the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission Report, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This attestation report is included on page 69 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(2)
Includes shares available for future issuance under the 2016 Plan in addition to the number of shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options referenced in column (a). In addition to stock options, the 2016 Plan provides for the issuance of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and units, deferred stock, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards, performance awards and units, or cash incentive awards. The amount in column (c) is net of 2.8 million shares underlying restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2024, which will be settled in shares of our common stock if the vesting conditions are met and thus reduce the common stock available for future share-based awards under the 2016 Plan by the amount vested. These shares take into account the anticipated vesting levels based on projected attainment of performance conditions for performance-based restricted stock units and have been multiplied by the applicable factor under the 2016 Plan to determine the remaining shares available as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, there were less than 0.1 million shares underlying deferred stock units outstanding under the previous 2008 Plan which will be settled in shares of our common stock if the vesting conditions are met and do not affect the number of shares reflected in column (c) above.

REPORT OF INDEPEND
ENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Perdoceo Education Corporation

Opinion on the financial statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Perdoceo Education Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.

Change in accounting principle

As discussed in Notes 4 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has adopted new accounting guidance in 2024 related to the disclosure of segment information in accordance with ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The adoption was retrospectively applied to 2023 and 2022.

Basis for opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical audit matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for credit losses

As described further in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, student receivables represent funds owed to the Company in exchange for the educational services provided to the student. Student receivables are reported net of an allowance for credit losses as determined by management at the end of each reporting period. Generally, a student receivable balance is written off once a student is out of school and it reaches greater than 90 days past due.

Management’s student receivable allowance is based on an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for student receivables. Its estimation methodology considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors that, based on collection experience, have an impact on repayment risk and ability to collect student receivables. Changes in the trends in any of these factors may impact the estimate of the allowance for credit losses. The factors include, but are not limited to repayment history, changes in the current economic, legislative, or regulatory environments, cash collection forecasts and the ability to complete the federal financial aid process with the student. These factors are monitored and assessed on a regular basis. Overall, the allowance estimation process for student receivables is assessed by comparing estimated and actual performance.

Our audit procedures related to the allowance for credit losses included the following, among others:

69

•
Assessed the appropriateness of management’s methodology for calculating the allowance including the significant inputs and assumptions utilized, including repayment history and the ability to complete the federal financial aid process with the student,

•
Recalculated the estimated allowance rates applied to the respective accounts receivable allowance categories determined according to funding sources and student status,

•
Tested the completeness and accuracy of data underlying management’s assertions and calculations for a selection of students, and compared our recalculations to management’s analysis to determine whether management’s conclusions were reasonable, and

•
Tested on a sample basis the subsequent cash collections on a student account.

In addition, we tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to establishing the allowance for credit losses.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Perdoceo Education Corporation

Opinion on internal control over financial reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Perdoceo Education Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework
 issued by COSO.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, and our report dated February 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (“Management’s Report”). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Our audit of, and opinion on, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over financial reporting of University of St. Augustine (“USAHS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 18 and 1.5 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. As indicated in Management’s Report, USAHS was acquired during 2024. Management’s assertion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over financial reporting of USAHS.

Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PERDOCEO EDUCATION CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY
Perdoceo’s accredited academic institutions offer a quality postsecondary education to a diverse student population, with fully online, campus-based and hybrid learning programs. The Company’s academic institutions – Colorado Technical University (“
CTU
”), the American InterContinental University System (“
AIUS
” or “
AIU System
”) and University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences ("
USAHS"
) – provide degree programs from the associate through doctoral level as well as non-degree seeking and professional development programs. Our academic institutions offer students industry-relevant and career-focused academic programs that are designed to meet the educational needs of today’s busy adults. CTU and AIUS continue to show innovation in higher education, advancing personalized learning technologies like their intellipath® learning platform and using data analytics and technology to serve and educate students while enhancing overall learning and academic experiences. USAHS is among the nation's reputable universities offering graduate health sciences degrees, primarily in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech language therapy and nursing, as well as continuing education programs. Perdoceo's academic institutions are committed to providing quality education that closes the gap between learners who seek to advance their careers and employers needing a qualified workforce.
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” “Perdoceo” and “PEC” refer to Perdoceo Education Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Financial Statement Presentation
These consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of Perdoceo Education Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries 
(collectively “Perdoceo” or “PEC”)
. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.

On December 2, 2024, the Company acquired the University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences (the "
USAHS acquisition
"). Results of operations related to the USAHS acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. See Note 3 "
Business Acquisition
" for further information.

Our reporting segments are determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board 
(“FASB”)
Accounting Standards Codification 
(“ASC”) 
Topic 280 – 
Segment Reporting
 and are based upon how the Company analyzes performance and makes decisions. Each segment represents a postsecondary education provider that offers a variety of academic programs. We organize our business across 
three
 reporting segments: CTU, AIUS and USAHS.
b. Management’s Use of Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(“GAAP”)
 requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. Significant estimates, among others, include the allowance for credit losses, the assumptions surrounding future projections of revenues and expenses used in determining the probable outcome of performance conditions related to performance-based compensation, the assumptions used in determining the discount rate to calculate right of use assets and lease liabilities, assumptions used in calculating income tax related matters including our deferred tax balances and any respective valuation allowance, fair values used in establishing the opening balance sheet for business combinations and fair values used in asset impairment evaluations including goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
c. Student Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses
Student receivables represent funds owed to us in exchange for the educational services provided to a student. Student receivables are reflected net of an allowance for credit losses at the end of the reporting period. Student receivables which are due to be paid in less than 
one year
 are recorded as current assets within our consolidated balance sheets. Student receivables which are due to be paid more than 
one year
 from the balance sheet date are reported as non-current assets within our consolidated balance sheets.
A substantial portion of our student receivables is repaid through the students’ participation in various federal financial aid programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended 
(“Higher Education Act”)
, which we refer to as “
Title IV Programs
.” For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately 
77
%,

76
% and 
79
%, respectively, of our institutions’ cash receipts from tuition payments came from Title IV Program funding.

76

Generally, a student receivable balance is written off once a student is out of school and it reaches greater than 
90
 days past due. Although we analyze past due receivables, it is not practical to provide an aging of our non-current student receivable balances as a result of the methodology used in determining our earned student receivable balances. Student receivables are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as they are deemed earned over the course of a student’s program and/or term, and therefore cash collections are not applied against specifically dated transactions.
We extend unsecured credit to a portion of the students who are enrolled at our academic institutions for tuition and certain other educational costs. Based upon past experience and judgment, we establish an allowance for credit losses with respect to student receivables which we estimate will ultimately not be collectible. As such, our results from operations only reflect the amount of revenue that is estimated to be reasonably collectible. Our standard student receivable allowance is based on an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for student receivables. Our estimation methodology considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors that, based on our collection experience, we believe have an impact on our repayment risk and ability to collect student receivables. Changes in the trends in any of these factors may impact our estimate of the allowance for credit losses. These factors include, but are not limited to: internal repayment history, changes in the current economic, legislative or regulatory environments, internal cash collection forecasts and the ability to complete the federal financial aid process with the student. These factors are monitored and assessed on a regular basis. Overall, our allowance estimation process for student receivables is validated by trending analysis and comparing estimated and actual performance.

We monitor our collections and write-off experience to assess whether or not adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary. Changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the collection of our student receivables, as noted above, or modifications to our collection practices, and other related policies may impact our estimate of our allowance for credit losses and our results from operations.
d. Revenue Recognition
Our revenue, which is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our universities, is generally segregated into two categories: (1) tuition and fees, and (2) other. Tuition and fees represent costs to our students for educational services provided by our universities and are reflected net of scholarships and tuition discounts. Our universities charge tuition and fees at varying amounts and bill students a single charge that covers tuition, certain fees and required program materials, such as textbooks and supplies, which we treat as a single performance obligation. Generally, we bill student tuition at the beginning of each academic term for our degree programs and recognize the tuition as revenue on a straight-line basis over the academic term. As part of a student’s course of instruction, certain fees, such as technology fees and graduation fees, are billed separately to students. These fees are generally earned over the applicable term and are not considered separate performance obligations. We generally bill student tuition upon enrollment for our non-degree professional development programs and recognize the tuition as revenue on a straight-line basis over the length of the offering.
For each term, the portion of tuition and fee payments received from students but not yet earned is recorded as deferred revenue and reported as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets, as we expect to earn these revenues within the next year. A contract asset is recorded for each student for the current term for which they are enrolled for the amount charged for the current term that has not yet been received as payment and to which we do not have the unconditional right to receive payment because the student has not reached the point in the student’s current academic term at which the amount billed is no longer refundable to the student. On a student by student basis, the contract asset is offset against the deferred revenue balance for the current term and the net deferred revenue balance is reflected within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. For certain of our institutions, students are billed as they enroll in courses, including courses related to future periods. Any billings for future periods would meet the definition of a contract asset as we do not have the unconditional right to receive payment as the course has not yet started. Contract assets related to future periods are offset against the respective deferred revenue associated with the future period.

If a student withdraws from one of our universities prior to the completion of the academic term, we refund the portion of tuition and fees already paid that, pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards, we are not entitled to retain. Pursuant to each university’s policy, once a student reaches the point in the term where no refund is given, the student would not have a refund due if withdrawing from the university subsequent to that date. Management reassesses collectability when a student withdraws from the university and has unpaid tuition charges for the current term which the university is entitled to retain per the applicable refund policy. In certain cases, such unpaid charges generally do not meet the threshold of reasonably collectible and are recognized as revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 when cash is received and the contract is terminated and neither party has further performance obligations.
Academic terms are determined by start dates, which vary by university and program and are generally 
8
-
16
 weeks in length.

Our non-degree professional development programs are available via subscription-based access for up to 
52
 weeks or online courses which are generally 
12
-
18
 weeks in length. Our students pay for their costs through a variety of funding sources, including federal loan and grant programs, institutional payment plans, employer tuition assistance, Veterans’ Administration and other military funding and grants, private and institutional scholarships and cash payments, as well as private loans.

77

Other revenue, which primarily consists of contract training revenue and miscellaneous non-student related revenue, is billed and recognized as goods are delivered or services are performed.
e. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash include cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months
 or less. The fair market value of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate their carrying value. The cash in the Company’s banks is not fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company has not experienced any material losses in such accounts. The restricted cash balance as of December 31, 2024

was
 $
22.6
 millio
n and primarily relates to a letter of credit USAHS is required to maintain with the Department of Education.
Students at our institutions may receive grants, loans and work-study opportunities to fund their education under Title IV Programs. In certain instances, students may request that we retain a portion of their Title IV funds provided to them in excess of tuition billings and authorize us to apply these funds to historical balances or future charges and/or distribute them directly to the student in certain cases. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we held
 $
9.4

million and $
9.5
 million, respectively, of these funds on behalf of students within cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet, with the offset recorded as prepaid revenue within deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets.
f. Investments

Our investments, which primarily consist of non-governmental debt securities and treasury and federal agencies securities are classified as “available-for-sale” and recorded at fair value. The Company measures the fair value of financial instruments under the guidance of ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurement
. Any unrealized holding gains or temporary unrealized holding losses, net of income tax effects, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity.

Realized gains and losses are computed on the basis of specific identification and are included in other income in our consolidated statements of income. Additionally, the Company reflects its available for sale securities at the net amount expected to be collected in accordance with ASC Topic 326, 
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
. The allowance for credit losses for available for sale securities is 
zero
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
g. Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets for financial reporting purposes and an accelerated method for income tax reporting purposes. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the life of the lease or the useful life. Assets under construction are recorded in construction-in-progress until they are available for use. Maintenance, repairs, minor renewals and betterments are expensed as incurred, and major improvements, which extend the useful life of the asset, are capitalized.
When the Company is involved in the construction of leased facilities to be used in its operations, upon construction commencement, the Company evaluates whether it, as lessee, controls the asset being constructed, and depending on the extent of involvement in the project, may be the “deemed owner” of the leased asset for accounting purposes during the construction period under a build-to-suit ("
BTS
") arrangement. If the Company is the “deemed owner” for accounting purposes during the construction period, upon construction commencement the Company is required to capitalize (i) costs incurred by the Company and (ii) the cash and non-cash assets contributed by the landlord for construction as property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet as construction-in-progress, with an offsetting financing obligation under construction financing. Upon completion of a construction project, where the Company is the deemed owner, the Company will perform a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if it can derecognize the BTS asset and corresponding financing obligation. If the asset and liability cannot be derecognized, the agreement is treated as a debt-like financing arrangement. In connection with the USAHS acquisition, the Company has recognized all cash and non-cash assets contributed by the landlord for construction as part of construction in progress, along with a corresponding construction financing liability. Specifically, the Company has recorded $
56.5
 million in construction contributions from the landlord as a construction financing liability on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
h. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350 – 
Intangibles-Goodwill and Other
, we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when an event or other circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value, by applying a fair-value-based test. In evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill, we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units, as defined under FASB ASC Topic 350. Goodwill is evaluated by comparing the book value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value, as determined by a combination of income and market approach valuation methodologies 
(“quantitative assessment”)
. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered to be impaired.

The amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of

78

the goodwill over the fair value of goodwill. In certain cases, a qualitative assessment may be used to determine if it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value and if the quantitative assessment is needed.
When performing a qualitative assessment for the annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, management must first consider events and circumstances that may affect the fair value of the reporting unit to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. Management focuses on the significant inputs and any events or circumstances that could affect the significant inputs, including, but not limited to, financial performance compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods, legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, political, business or other factors, and industry and market considerations, such as a deteriorating operating environment or increased competition. Management evaluates all events and circumstances, including positive or mitigating factors, that could affect the significant inputs used to determine fair value. If management determines that it is not more likely than not that the goodwill of the reporting unit is impaired based upon its qualitative assessment then it does not need to perform the quantitative assessment.

When performing a quantitative assessment for the annual review of goodwill balances for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on projected future operating results and cash flows, market assumptions and/or comparative market multiple methods. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, relative market share, new student interest, student retention, future expansion or contraction expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes do reflect improvements relative to recent historical periods with respect to, among other things, modest revenue growth and operating margins. Although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions, historically projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved. The failure of one of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge. Significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. In addition to cash flow estimates, our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions.
Intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets. Indefinite-lived assets include our CTU trade name and accreditation rights, and our USAHS trade name, which are recorded at fair market value upon acquisition and subsequently reviewed on an annual basis for impairment. Accreditation rights represent the ability of our institutions to participate in Title IV Programs.
Definite-lived intangible assets consist of customer relationships, course curriculum, developed technology, accreditation rights  and trade names, primarily from recent acquisitions. Customer relationships represent the value of acquired student and third party contracts and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated future benefit period for those contracts. Course curriculum represents the value of acquired curriculum, including lesson plans and syllabi, used to deliver educational services. Acquired course curriculum balances are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are estimated by management based upon, among other things, the expected future utilization period and the nature of the related academic programs. Developed technology represents online auditory and video course program materials related to our non-degree professional development programs and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of future benefit. Accreditation rights represents federal, state and programmatic accreditation which allows our schools to operate and meet certain regulatory requirements. Accreditation rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life, which are estimated based upon the average remaining term before a campus would need to reapply for accreditation.

See Note 10 “
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
” for further discussion.
i. Contingencies
During the ordinary course of business, the Company may be subject to various claims and contingencies. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450 – 
Contingencies
, when we become aware of a claim or potential claim, we assess the likelihood of any related loss or exposure. The probability a liability has been incurred, and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, is analyzed, and if the loss contingency is both probable and reasonably estimable, then we accrue for costs, including direct costs incurred, associated with the loss contingency. If no accrual is made but the loss contingency is reasonably possible, we disclose the nature of the contingency and the related estimate of possible loss or range of loss if such an estimate can be made. For all matters that are currently being reviewed, we expense legal fees, including defense costs, as they are incurred. Loss contingencies include, but are not limited to, possible losses related to legal proceedings and regulatory compliance matters, and our assessment of exposure requires subjective assessment. Liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops, circumstances change, or contingencies are resolved. See Note 12 “
Contingencies
” for additional information.

79

j. Income Taxes
We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These tax laws are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result, significant judgments and interpretations are required in determining our income tax provisions (benefits) and evaluating our uncertain tax positions.
We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 
– Income Taxes
. Topic 740 requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the income tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Topic 740 also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance and/or release of a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. Topic 740 provides that important factors in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized are whether there has been sufficient taxable income in recent years and whether sufficient taxable income is expected in future years in order to use the deferred tax asset. In evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets, we consider, among other things, historical levels of taxable income along with possible sources of future taxable income, which include: the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences, the existence of taxable income in prior carryback year(s), the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits, expected future taxable income and earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount, coupled with evidence indicating the loss is not a continuing condition. Changes in, among other things, income tax legislation, statutory income tax rates, or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance, or release all or a portion of the valuation allowance if it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets are expected to be realized. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. A high degree of judgment is required to determine if, and the extent to which, valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets.
Topic 740 further clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. Topic 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.
k. Leases
FASB ASC Topic 842 – 
Leases
 states that all leases create an asset and a liability for the lessee in accordance with FASB Concept Statements No. 6 Elements of Financial Statements, and thus requires the recognition of a lease liability and a right of use asset at the lease inception date. We lease most of our administrative and educational facilities under non-cancelable operating or finance leases. In most cases, we are required to make additional payments under facility leases for taxes, insurance and other operating expenses incurred during the lease period, which are typically variable in nature. We determine if a contract contains a lease when the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Upon such identification and commencement of a lease, we establish a right of use 
(“ROU”)
 asset and a lease liability within our consolidated balance sheets.

A lease component is defined as an asset within the lease contract that a lessee can benefit from the use of and is not highly dependent or interrelated with other assets in the arrangement. A lease contract may contain multiple lease components. A non-lease component is defined as a component of the lease that transfers a good or service for the underlying asset, such as maintenance services. We have determined that all of our leases contain one lease component related to the building and land. We have determined that treating the land together with the building as one lease component would not result in a significant difference from accounting for them as separate lease components. We elected the practical expedient to include both the lease component and the non-lease component as a single component when accounting for each lease and calculating the resulting lease liability and ROU asset. Any remaining contract consideration, such as property taxes and insurance, that does not meet the definition of a lease component or non-lease component would be allocated to the single lease component based on our election.
The lease liability represents future lease payments for lease and non-lease components discounted for present value. Lease payments that may be included in the lease liability include fixed payments, variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate and payments for penalties for terminating the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to use a termination option, among others. Certain of our leases contain rent escalation clauses that are specifically stated in the lease and these are included in the calculation of the lease liability. Variable lease payments for lease and non-lease components which are not based on an index or rate are excluded from the calculation of the lease liability and are recognized in the statement of income during the period incurred.

80

The ROU asset consists of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability and adjusted for any lease incentives, including rent abatements and tenant improvement allowances, and any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee. The ROU asset is amortized over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis and recorded within educational services and facilities expense on our consolidated statements of income.
The lease term is determined by taking into account the initial period as stated in the lease contract and adjusted for any renewal options that the company is reasonably certain to exercise as well as any period of time that the lessee has control of the space before the stated initial term of the lease. If we determine that we are reasonably certain to exercise a termination option, the lease term is then adjusted to account for the expected termination date.
We use discount rates to determine the net present value of our gross lease obligations when calculating the lease liability and related ROU asset. In cases in which the rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable, we use that discount rate for purposes of the net present value calculation. In most cases, our lease agreements do not have a discount rate that is readily determinable and therefore we use an estimate of our incremental borrowing rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is determined at lease commencement or lease modification and represents the rate of interest we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.
See Note 9 “
Leases
” for further details.

l. Share-Based Compensation

FASB ASC Topic 718
 – Compensation-Stock Compensation
 requires that all share-based payments to employees and non-employee directors, including grants of stock options, shares or units of restricted stock, and the compensatory elements of employee stock purchase plans, be recognized in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued.
Our share-based awards are measured at fair value and recognized over the requisite service or performance period. The fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, based on the market price of the underlying common stock, expected life, expected stock price volatility and expected risk-free interest rate. Expected volatility is computed using a combination of historical volatility for a period equal to the expected term; the risk-free interest rates are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve, with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term used in the option pricing model. The fair value of each restricted stock unit award is estimated based on the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of each market-based performance grant is estimated using the Monte Carlo Simulation methodology to assess the grant date fair value. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. For our performance-based awards, the performance criteria is assessed each reporting period to determine the probability of attainment.
See Note 14 “
Share-Based Compensation
” for further discussion of our share-based compensation plans, the nature of share-based awards issued under the plans and our accounting for share-based awards.
m. Advertising and Marketing Costs

Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising and marketing costs, which are included in general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of income, were $
101.0
 million, $
102.6
 million and $
126.8
 million, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
n. Inventories
Inventories all relate to finished goods consisting principally of laptops and supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or market. The cost of inventory is reflected as a component of educational services and facilities expense as the items are used or sold.

3. BUSINESS ACQUISITION
On December 2, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of the University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences ("
USAHS
").
USAHS is among the nation’s reputable universities offering graduate health sciences degrees, primarily in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech language therapy and nursing, as well as continuing education programs. Founded in 1979, USAHS educates students through its network of campuses in San Marcos, California; St. Augustine and Miami, Florida; and Austin and Dallas, Texas and through its online programs.

81

The preliminary purchase price of $
136.9
 million for USAHS was allocated to the preliminary fair values of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets of $
268.3
 million and assumed liabilities of $
131.4
 million as of December 2, 2024. The preliminary purchase price consisted of an initial cash payment made in December 2024, and an estimated working capital true up of $
0.9
 million to be made within 90 days of December 2, 2024. Based on our preliminary purchase price allocation, we have recorded goodwill of $
16.9
 million. Goodwill reflects the inherent value of the acquired workforce as well as revenue growth opportunities following the acquisition. All of this goodwill balance will not be deductible for income tax reporting purposes. Management's purchase price allocation is provisional as the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities are still being finalized, primarily due to the timing of the acquisition which occurred in December 2024.
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of acquisition date (dollars in thousands):

4. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Recent accounting guidance adopted in 2024
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ("
ASU
") No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):
 Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. The amendments in this ASU improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this update require that a public entity disclose on an annual and interim basis, 1) significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker ("
CODM
") and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, 2) an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. The other segment items category is the difference between segment revenue less the segment expenses disclosed under the significant expense principle and each reported measure of segment profit or loss, and 3) disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. For all public business entities, ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 31, 2023 and interim periods with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024; early adoption is permitted. We have evaluated and adopted this guidance in 2024. The adoption did not significantly impact the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.

Recent accounting guidance not yet adopted

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740):
 Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. The amendments in this ASU require that public business entities on an annual basis 1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation, and 2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The amendments require disclosure about income taxes paid by federal, state and foreign taxes, and by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid is equal or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid. The amendment also requires entities to disclose income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense disaggregated between domestic and foreign and income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state and foreign. For all public business entities, ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024; early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating this guidance and believe the adoption will not significantly impact the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.
In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): 
Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions
. The amendments in this ASU clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. For all public business entities, ASU 2022-03 is effective for annual periods and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024; early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating this guidance and believe the adoption will not significantly impact the presentation of our financial condition, results of operations and disclosures.

Fair Value Measurements
FASB ASC Topic 820 – 
Fair Value Measurement
 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we held investments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These investments (available for sale) consist of non-governmental debt securities and treasury and federal agencies securities. Available for sale securities included in Level 2 are estimated based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, such as quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
All of our available for sale investments were measured under Level 2 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Additionally, money market funds of
 $
30.2
 million and $
30.3
 million included within cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were measured under Level 1. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, federal agency debt securities amounting to $
13.1
 million and $
44.9
 million, respectively, which are included in cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets, were valued using Level 2 inputs.

Equity Method Investment
Our investment in an equity affiliate, which was previously recorded within other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets, represents an international investment in a private company.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 we recorded a loss of approximately $
1.2
 million, a gain of less than $
0.1
 million and a loss of approximately $
1.8
 million, respectively, related to our equity affiliate, which is reported within miscellaneous (expense) income on our consolidated statements of income. The losses in 2024 and 2022 included impairments of $
1.1
 million and $
1.2
 million, respectively, due to a decline in projected cash flows for our equity affiliate, with the loss recorded in 2024 bringing our investment value down to 
zero
 as of December 31, 2024.
We make periodic operating maintenance payments to our equity affiliate. The total fees recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

Performance Obligations
Our revenue, which is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our universities, is generally segregated into two categories: (1) tuition and fees, and (2) other. Tuition and fees represent costs to our students for educational services provided by our universities and are reflected net of scholarships and tuition discounts. Our universities charge tuition and fees at varying amounts and bill students a single charge that covers tuition, certain fees and required program materials, such as textbooks and supplies, which we treat as a single performance obligation. Generally, we bill student tuition at the beginning of each academic term for our degree programs and recognize the tuition as revenue on a straight-line basis over the academic term. As part of a student’s course of instruction, certain fees, such as technology fees and graduation fees, are billed separately to students. These fees are generally earned over the applicable term and are not considered separate performance obligations. We generally bill student tuition upon enrollment for our non-degree professional development programs and recognize the tuition as revenue on a straight-line basis over the length of the offering.
Other revenue, which primarily consists of contract training

revenue and miscellaneous non-student related revenue, is billed and recognized as goods are delivered or services are performed.
Contract Assets

85

For each term, the portion of tuition and fee payments received from students but not yet earned is recorded as deferred revenue and reported as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets, as we expect to earn these revenues within the next year. A contract asset is recorded for each student for the current term for which they are enrolled for the amount charged for the current term that has not yet been received as payment and to which we do not have the unconditional right to receive payment because the student has not reached the point in the student’s current academic term at which the amount billed is no longer refundable to the student. On a student by student basis, the contract asset is offset against the deferred revenue balance for the current term and the net deferred revenue balance is reflected within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. For certain of our institutions, students are billed as they enroll in courses, including courses related to future periods. Any billings for future periods would meet the definition of a contract asset as we do not have the unconditional right to receive payment as the course has not yet started. Contract assets related to future periods are offset against the respective deferred revenue associated with the future period.
Due to the short-term nature of our academic terms, the contract asset balance which exists at the beginning of each quarter will no longer be a contract asset at the end of that quarter, with the exception of the contract assets associated with future periods. The decrease in contract asset balances are a result of one of the following: it becomes a student receivable balance once a student reaches the point in a student’s academic term where the amount billed is no longer refundable to the student; a refund is made to withdrawn students for the portion entitled to be refunded under each institutions’ refund policy; we receive funds to apply against the contract asset balance; or a student makes a change to the number of classes they are enrolled in which may cause an adjustment to their previously billed amount. As of the end of each quarter, a new contract asset is determined on a student by student basis based on the most recently started term and a student’s progress within that term as compared to the date at which the student is no longer entitled to a refund under each institution’s refund policy. Contract assets associated with future periods remain as contract assets until the course begins and the student reaches the point in that course that they are no longer entitled to a refund.

Cash Receipts
Our students pay for their costs through a variety of funding sources, including federal loan and grant programs, institutional payment plans, employer tuition assistance, Veterans’ Administration and other military funding and grants, private and institutional scholarships and cash payments, as well as private loans. Cash receipts from government related sources are typically received during the current academic term. We typically receive funds after the end of an academic term for students who receive employer tuition assistance. Students who have not applied for any type of financial aid or students whose financial aid may not fully cover the cost of their tuition and fees generally set up a payment plan with the university and make payments on a monthly basis per the terms of the payment plan.
If a student withdraws from one of our academic institutions prior to the completion of the academic term, we refund the portion of tuition and fees already paid that, pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards, we are not entitled to retain. Generally, the amount to be refunded to a student is calculated based upon the percent of the term attended and the amount of tuition and fees paid by the student as of their withdrawal date. In certain circumstances, we have recognized revenue for students who have withdrawn that we are not entitled to retain. We have estimated a reserve for these limited circumstances based on historical evidence in the amount of
 $
2.1
 m
illion and $
2.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Students are typically entitled to a partial refund until approximately a little more than halfway through their term. Pursuant to each university’s policy, once a student reaches the point in the term where no refund is given, the student would not have a refund due if withdrawing from the university subsequent to that date.

Significant Judgments
We analyze revenue recognition on a portfolio approach under ASC Topic 606. Significant judgment is used in determining the appropriate portfolios to assess for meeting the criteria to recognize revenue under ASC Topic 606. We have determined that all of our students can be grouped into 
one
 portfolio. Based on our past experience, students at different universities, in different programs or with different funding all behave similarly. Enrollment agreements all contain similar terms, refund policies are similar across all institutions and students work with the university to obtain some type of funding, for example, Title IV Program funds, Veterans Administration funds, military funding, employer tuition assistance or self-pay. We have significant historical data for our students which allows us to analyze collectability. We do not expect that revenue earned for the portfolio is significantly different as compared to revenue that would be earned if we were to assess each student contract separately.

Significant judgment is also required to assess collectability, particularly as it relates to students seeking funding under Title IV Programs. Because students are required to provide documentation, and in some cases extensive documentation, to the Department to be eligible and approved for funding, the timeframe for this process can sometimes span between 
90
 to 
120 days
. We monitor the progress of students through the eligibility and approval process and assess collectability for the portfolio each reporting period to monitor that the collectability threshold is met.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we received a majority of our universities’ cash receipts for tuition payments from various government agencies as well as our corporate engagements. These cash receipts represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and all have low risk of collectability.

7. STUDENT RECEIVABLES
Student receivables represent funds owed to us in exchange for the educational services provided to a student. Student receivables are reflected net of an allowance for credit losses at the end of the reporting period. Student receivables, net, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as components of both current and non-current assets.
Our students pay for their costs through a variety of funding sources, including federal loan and grant programs, institutional payment plans, employer tuition assistance, Veterans’ Administration and other military funding and grants, private and institutional scholarships and cash payments, as well as private loans. Cash receipts from government related sources are typically received during the current academic term. We typically receive funds after the end of an academic term for students who receive employer tuition assistance. Students who have not applied for any type of financial aid or students whose financial aid may not fully cover the cost of their tuition and fees generally set up a payment plan with the institution and make payments on a monthly basis per the terms of the payment plan. For those balances that are not received during the academic term, the balance is typically due within the current academic year which is approximately 
30
 weeks in length. Generally, a student receivable balance is written off once a student has been out of school for greater than 
90
 days and has not made a payment.

Our standard student receivable allowance is based on an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for student receivables. Our estimation methodology considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors that, based on our collection experience, we believe

87

have an impact on our repayment risk and ability to collect student receivables. Changes in the trends in any of these factors may impact our estimate of the allowance for credit losses. These factors include, but are not limited to: internal repayment history, changes in the current economic, legislative or regulatory environments, internal cash collection forecasts and the ability to complete the federal financial aid process with the student. These factors are monitored and assessed on a regular basis. Overall, our allowance estimation process for student receivables is validated by trend analysis of our collections and write-off experience as well as monitoring any emerging factors that we believe impact the ability to collect our student receivables.

We have an immaterial amount of student receivables that are due greater than 12 months from the date of our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount of non-current student receivables under payment plans that are longer than 12 months in duration, net of allowance for credit losses, w
as $
6.2
 million an
d $
3.9
 million, respectively.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We define student receivables as a portfolio segment under ASC Topic 326 – 
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses.
 Changes in our current and non-current allowance for credit losses related to our student receivable portfolio in accordance with the guidance under ASU 2016-13 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

Fair Value Measurements
The carrying amount reported in our consolidated balance sheets for the current portion of student receivables approximates fair value because of the nature of these financial instruments as they generally have short maturity periods. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of the non-current portion of student receivables, since observable market data is not readily available, and no reasonable estimation methodology exists.

 million in asset impairment, mainly related to leasehold improvements at leased facilities the Company decided not to continue using.

9. LEASES
We lease most of our administrative and educational facilities under non-cancelable operating or finance leases expiring at various dates through 
2049
. In most cases, we are required to make additional payments under facility operating leases for taxes, insurance and other operating expenses incurred during the operating lease period, which are typically variable in nature.
We determine if a contract contains a lease when the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Upon identification and commencement of a lease, we establish a right of use 
(“ROU”)
 asset and a lease liability.

Construction Financing
Upon construction commencement of its new St. Augustine campus in April 2023, the Company determined that it was the deemed owner for accounting purposes during the construction period under a BTS arrangement due to the extent of the Company’s involvement in the project. Accordingly, the Company has recognized all cash and non-cash assets contributed by the landlord to the project as of December 31, 2024 as a component of construction in progress with a corresponding construction financing liability. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has recognized $
56.5
 million in construction contributions made by the landlord as construction financing on the consolidated balance sheet. Lease commencement will begin upon substantial completion of the BTS arrangement with a stated lease term of 
25
 years from commencement date, with an estimated total lease obligation of $
158.4
 million over the term of the lease. The lease commenced in January 2025.

S
ignificant Judgments and Assumptions
We use discount rates to determine the net present value of our gross lease obligations when calculating the lease liability and related ROU asset. In cases in which the rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable, we use that discount rate for purposes of the net present value calculation. In most cases, our lease agreements do not have a discount rate that is readily determinable and therefore we use an estimate of our incremental borrowing rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is determined at lease commencement or lease modification and represents the rate of interest we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.

We have 
17
 leases related to our ongoing operations which consist of administrative offices and university locations, of which 
two
 are either month to month leases or had an initial lease term of less than one year and therefore are not included in the lease liability and ROU asset recorded within our consolidated balance sheet, 
one
 is related to a sale-leaseback transaction which is ending in March 2025, and one is related to a build to suit arrangement. For those leases that we are reasonably certain that we will extend or terminate the leases at lease conception or modification, we have taken those factors into account when determining the lease liability recorded within our consolidated balance sheet.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded $
1.6
 million of asset impairment charges related to certain ROU assets within the CTU segment and $
2.0
 million of asset impairment charges related to certain ROU assets within the AIUS segment. Management made the decision to no longer use the spaces associated with the ROU assets and as a result recorded an asset impairment charge in accordance with ASC Topic 360 for the remaining value that has been vacated, adjusted for any early lease termination options that the Company plans to execute.

In assessing the fair value for our reporting units, we performed a qualitative assessment as of October 1, 2024 to determine if we believe it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ carrying values exceed their respective fair values. When performing the qualitative assessment, management first considered events and circumstances that may affect the fair value of the reporting unit to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. Management focused on the significant inputs, including its projections of revenue growth, operating expense leverage and the discount rate used in the prior year quantitative assessment, and any events or circumstances that could affect the significant inputs. These events and circumstances included, but were not limited to, financial performance, future expectations of financial performance, legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, political, business or other factors, and industry and market considerations, such as a deteriorating operating environment or increased competition. Management evaluated all events and circumstances, including positive or mitigating factors, that could affect the significant inputs used to determine fair value. Additionally, management evaluated its most recent quantitative assessment to determine by how much the previous fair value exceeded the carrying value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset.
The determination of estimated fair value of each reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions, and as such, these fair value measurements are categorized as Level 3 per ASC Topic 820. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating cash flow projections and capital expenditure forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in deriving those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. We evaluate the merits of each significant assumption used, both individually and in the aggregate, to assess the fair value of each reporting unit for reasonableness.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net book value of intangible assets other than goodwill are as follows (dollars in thousands):

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized 
asset 
impairment charges of $
9.7
 million in the CTU segment and $
1.1
 million in the AIUS segment, respectively, related to certain definite-lived intangible assets, due to a decline in cash flows associated with those assets. The fair value of these intangible assets were determined to be zero based on the projected cash flow estimates for the remaining useful life of the primary asset.
On June 30, 2023, the Company entered into a non-cash asset purchase agreement with Le Cordon Bleu International B.V. ("
LCBI
"), a company incorporated in The Netherlands, to sell Perdoceo's outright rights to the Le Cordon Bleu ("
LCB
") brand, trade names and rights for North America in exchange for 
1.8
 million outstanding shares of Perdoceo's stock. The fair value of the 
1.8
 million shares received was $
22.1
 million, resulting in a non-cash gain on sale of asset of $
22.1
 million recorded within other miscellaneous income (expense) on our consolidated statements of income with the offset being recorded as an addition to treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheet.

As of December 31, 2024, net intangible assets include certain accreditation rights and trade names that are considered to have indefinite useful lives and, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350
—Intangibles—Goodwill and Other
, are not subject to amortization but rather reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair-value-based test.

We performed our annual impairment testing of other indefinite-lived intangible asset balances as of October 1, 2024 utilizing the qualitative assessment approach and concluded that no i
ndicators existed that would suggest that it is more likely than not that the assets would be impaired. We monitor the operating results and revenue projections related to our indefinite-lived trade names and accreditation rights on a quarterly basis for signs of possible declines in estimated fair value. When performing the qualitative assessment, management considered events and circumstances that may affect the fair value of the intangible assets to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. These events and circumstances included, but were not limited to, financial performance, future expectations of financial performance, legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, political, business, and industry and market considerations. Management evaluated these events and circumstances, including positive or mitigating factors, that could affect the significant inputs used to determine fair value.

11. CREDIT AGREEMENT
 On January 23, 2024, the Company and the subsidiary guarantors thereunder entered into a Second Amendment (the “
Second Amendment
”) to their credit agreement, dated as of September 8, 2021 and as amended on April 1, 2022 (the “
Existing Credit Agreement
”), with the lenders from time to time parties thereto and Wintrust Bank N.A. (“
Wintrust
”), in its capacities as the sole lead arranger, sole bookrunner, administrative agent and letter of credit issuer thereunder (the Existing Credit Agreement, as further amended by the Second Amendment, the “
Credit Agreement
”).
The Second Amendment, among other things: (i) extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to 
January 31, 2027
; (ii) lowered the “Prime Rate” floor from 
4
% to 
3
%;

(iii) replaced BMO Bank N.A. (formerly known as BMO Harris Bank N.A.) with Valley National Bancorp as one of the lenders that were party to the revolving credit facility; and (iv) modified the relative commitments of the lenders that were parties to the revolving credit facility.
Termination of credit agreement
On July 29, 2024, the Company gave notice of the termination of its credit agreement, dated as of September 8, 2021, as amended, by and among the Company, as borrower, certain of its subsidiary guarantors thereunder, the lenders from time-to-time parties thereto and Wintrust Bank N.A. (the “
Termination
”).

92

At the time of the Termination of the Credit Agreement, the Company was not in default under the Credit Agreement, 
no
r did it have any amounts outstanding thereunder. The Credit Agreement was due to mature on 
January 31, 2027
. The Company made the decision to terminate the Credit Agreement due to the Company’s strong cash position and to avoid uncertainty under the Credit Agreement associated with newly effective Title IV financial responsibility requirements.

The Termination was effective on July 30, 2024. Upon effectiveness of the Termination, all security interests and pledges granted to the secured parties under the Credit Agreement were terminated and released. The Company did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with the Termination.
Selected details of our credit agreement as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (dollars in thousands):

An accrual for estimated legal fees and settlements 
of $
1.2
 milli
on and $
2.4
 million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is presented within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, at least quarterly, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that was previously accrued and make adjustments as further information develops, circumstances change or contingencies are resolved. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We may be unable to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss due to various reasons, including, among others: (1) if the damages sought are indeterminate; (2) if the proceedings are in early stages; (3) if there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals, motions or settlements; (4) if there are significant factual issues to be determined or resolved; and (5) if there are novel or unsettled legal theories presented. In such instances, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss, if any.
United States of America, ex rel. Fiorisce LLC v. Perdoceo Education Corporation, Colorado Technical University, Inc. and American InterContinental University, Inc. 
On July 19, 2023, we became aware of an amended complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on May 19, 2023.

The original complaint was filed under seal on February 25, 2021 by a former employee of Colorado Technical University through a limited liability company, on behalf of herself, any other interested parties affiliated with the LLC and the federal government. On July 18, 2023, the district court ordered the complaint unsealed and we were notified that the U.S. Department of Justice ("
DOJ"
) had declined to intervene in the action on February 3, 2023. The company had previously received a Civil Investigative Demand (
"CID"
) on April 8, 2022 from the DOJ and had been cooperating with the DOJ in its review. After the federal government declined to intervene in this case, the relator elected to pursue the litigation on behalf of the federal government. If she is successful, she would receive a portion of the federal government’s recovery. The amended complaint alleges violations of the False Claims Act related to the company’s compliance with federal financial aid credit hour requirements in connection with its use of its learning management system. Relator claims that defendants’ conduct caused the government to make payments of federal funds to defendants which the government would not have made if not for defendants’ alleged violation of the law. Relator seeks treble damages plus civil penalties and attorneys’ fees. On January 4, 2024, the Court granted a motion to dismiss with respect to Perdoceo Education Corporation and American InterContinental University, Inc. which removes them as defendants in the case. The Court’s dismissal was “without prejudice”, which allows the relator in the case the opportunity to amend and refile a further amended complaint with respect to those two parties. The Relator has filed a motion, which is pending before the Court, that seeks permission to file a further amended complaint with respect to only Perdoceo Education Corporation.

93

On September 7, 2024, the Company received a new CID from the DOJ pursuant to the False Claims Act. The CID requests information and documentation from CTU regarding its compensation practices for its admissions staff as well as information about how CTU has discussed its Fast Track credit program with prospective students. The information sought covers the time period from November 13, 2017 to the present. The Company is cooperating with the DOJ with a view towards resolving this inquiry as promptly as possible.
Because of the many questions of fact and law that may arise, the outcome of this legal proceeding is uncertain at this point. Based on information available to us at present, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential loss, if any, for this action. Accordingly, we have not recognized any liability associated with this action.
We receive from time-to-time requests from state attorneys general, federal and state government agencies and accreditors relating to our institutions, to specific complaints they have received from students or former students or to student loan forgiveness claims which seek information about students, our programs, and other matters relating to our activities. These requests can be broad and time consuming to respond to, and there is a risk that they could expand and/or lead to a formal action or claims of non-compliance. We are subject to a variety of other claims, lawsuits, arbitrations and investigations that arise from time to time out of the conduct of our business, including, but not limited to, matters involving prospective students, students or former students, alleged violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, both individually and on behalf of a putative class, and employment matters. Periodically matters arise that we consider outside the scope of ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business. While we currently believe that these matters, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. Were an unfavorable outcome to occur in any one or more of these matters, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial position and cash flows.

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 include
s a $
0.9
 million favorable adjustment associated with the tax effect of stock-based compensation, which decreased the effective tax rate by 
0.4
%.
The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 reflects a $
4.5
 million favorable adjustment related to the recognition of the tax benefits associated with a previously disclosed prior year ordinary loss attributable to the stock of a worthless subsidiary, which decreased the effective tax rate by 
2.4
%.
The effective tax r
ate for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflects the establishment of a full valuation allowance of $
1.4
 million with respect to select combined state net operating losses that are anticipated to go unused and $
0.9
 million related to the expected non-deductibility of reductions in the carrying value of our equity investment, which collectively increased the effective rate by 
1.7
%. During 2022, the Company re-evaluated the character of the loss incurred on the elimination of a wholly-owned subsidiary during the prior year and re-categorized this

transaction in its 2021 tax returns as an ordinary loss attributable to the stock of a worthless subsidiary. As a result of our assessment, the $
3.1
 million deferred tax asset and offsetting valuation allowance with respect to the capital loss carryforward was eliminated, which had an offsetting impact on the effective tax rate of 
2.3
%.

The total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in future periods was $
27.4
 million and $
22.9
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, our short and long-term reserves, recorded within current accrued income taxes and other non-current liabilities, respectively, related to FASB’s interpretation No. 48 of ASC Topic 740-10, 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes 
or 
(“FIN 48”)
, were $
2.2
 million and $
28.1
 million, respectively. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of income. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties resulting from such unrecognized tax benefits was $
4.4
 million and $
3.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized expenses of less than $
1.0
 million, less than $
0.7
 million and less than $
0.4
 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties from unrecognized tax benefits in our consolidated results of operations.

Perdoceo and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. and in various state and local jurisdictions and are routinely examined by tax authorities in these jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2024, the Company's federal income tax returns are open to examinations for the tax years ended December 31, 2021 and forward. 
Due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations
, it is reasonably possible that Perdoceo’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of 
zero
 to $
3.1
 million.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary differences in the recognition of various expenses for tax and financial statement purposes, and from the recognition of the tax benefits of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. 
Components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows (dollars in

As of December 31, 2024, the Company has a gross deferred tax asset before valuation allowance of $
373.0
 million and a gross deferred tax liability of $
79.1
 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a gross deferred tax asset before valuation allowance of $
151.7
 million and a gross deferred tax liability of $
38.8
 million.
Included among USAHS' gross deferred tax assets at the time of acquisition was a federal net operating loss ("
NOL
") carryforward of approximately $
16.2
 million, amortizable intangible assets of approximately $
202.3
 million, an interest expense disallowance carryforward of approximately $
18.1
 million and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $
7.7
 million. For the tax year ended December 31, 2024, we expect to claim approximately $
0.8
 million of tax amortization and 
no
 portion of the federal and state NOL or interest expense disallowance carryforwards due to the limitation on the utilization of acquired tax attributes. Excluding the USAHS NOLs referred to above, we have a federal NOL carryforward of $
3.9
 million, which we expect to utilize in 2024. Additionally, we have state NOL carryforwards of approximately $
222.1
 million, which expire between 
2024
 and 
2037
. Of this amount, approximately $
51.8
 million relates to separate state NOL carryforwards and $
128.3
 million relates to combined state NOL carryforwards, which we anticipate will not be utilized. Valuation allowances have been established against the full amounts of the deferred tax balances for these separate and combined state NOL carryforwards.
As of December 31, 2023 a valuation allowance of $
14.0
 million was maintained with respect to our equity investment, available for sale short-term investments and state NOLs. During the year, our valuation allowance for state NOLs decreased $
2.1
 million due to the elimination of separate state NOLs upon the dissolution of inactive subsidiaries and the valuation allowance attributable to our available for sale short-term investments was no longer needed since we are in a cumulative unrealized gain position. As of December 31, 2024, the total valuation allowance attributable to our equity investment and state NOLs is $
12.0
 million. 
After considering both positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets, the Company concluded the cumulative losses related to the reduction in carrying value of the equity investment are significant relative to the amount invested and indicative of a potential capital loss, which would not be realizable given the absence of offsetting capital gains. The separate state NOLs can only be used by the originating entity and generally relate to entities that no longer maintain active schools. Since these entities are not expected to generate future operating income, the more likely than not threshold was not reached with respect to this portion of the deferred tax assets. Similarly, the Company determined a valuation allowance was needed with respect to the portion of the combined state NOLs which will likely go unused due to the teach-out of the schools located in the

96

applicable 
combined filing jurisdictions. We will continue to evaluate our valuation allowance in future years for any change in circumstances that causes a change in judgment about the realizability of these deferred tax assets.

14. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Overview of Share-Based Compensation Plans
The Perdoceo Education Corporation Amended and Restated 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan (“the “
2016 Plan
”) became effective (as the Career Education Corporation 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan) on May 24, 2016, and the amendment and restatement of the 2016 Plan became effective on June 3, 2021, upon its approval by the Company’s stockholders. Under the 2016 Plan, Perdoceo may grant to eligible participants awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock, performance units, annual incentive awards, and substitute awards, which generally may be settled in cash or shares of our common stock. Any shares of our common stock that are subject to awards of stock options or stock appreciation rights payable in shares will be counted as 
1.0
 share for each share issued for purposes of the aggregate share limit and any shares of our common stock that are subject to any other form of award payable in shares will be counted as 
1.35
 shares for each share issued for purposes of the aggregate share limit. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 
4.0
 million shares of common stock available for future share-based awards under the 2016 Plan, which is net of (i) 
0.3
 million shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and (ii) 
2.8
 million shares underlying restricted stock units, which will be settled in shares of our common stock if the vesting conditions are met and thus reduce the common stock available for future share-based awards under the 2016 Plan by the amount vested. These shares take into account the anticipated vesting levels based on projected attainment of performance conditions for performance-based restricted stock units and have been multiplied by the applicable factor under the 2016 Plan to determine the remaining shares available as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024 under the Company’s previous 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan, there were approximately 
0.1
 million shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and 
0.1
 million shares underlying outstanding deferred stock units, which will be settled in shares of our common stock if the vesting conditions are met. The vesting of all types of awards is subject to possible acceleration in certain circumstances. If a plan participant terminates employment for any reason other than by death or disability during the vesting period, the right to unvested equity awards is generally forfeited.
As of December 31, 2024, we estimate that compensation expense of approximately $
16.0
 million will be recognized over the next 
four years
 for all unvested share-based awards that have been granted to participants. This amount excludes any estimates of forfeitures.
Stock Options.
 The exercise price of stock options granted under each of the plans is equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Employee stock options generally become exercisable 
25
% per year over a 
four-year
 service period beginning on the date of grant and expire 
ten years
 from the date of grant. Non-employee directors’ stock options expire 
ten years
 from the date of grant and generally become 
100
% exercisable after the first anniversary of the grant date. Grants of stock options are generally only subject to the service conditions discussed previously.

Restricted Stock Units to be Settled in Stock.
 Restricted stock units to be settled in shares of stock which are not “performance-based” generally vest 
25
% per year over a 
four-year
 service period. Restricted stock units which are “performance-based” are subject to performance or market conditions that may increase or reduce the number of restricted stock units that vest at the end of the requisite service period or result in all units being forfeited, even if the requisite service period is met. The performance-based restricted stock units generally vest 
three years
 after the grant date.

Deferred Stock Units to be Settled in Stock.
 Perdoceo

granted deferred stock units to our non-employee directors

prior to 2017. The deferred stock units are to be settled in shares of stock. Settlement of the deferred stock units and delivery of the underlying shares of stock to the plan participants does not occur until he or she ceases to provide services to the Company in the capacity of a director, employee or consultant. As of December 31, 2024, there are 
58
 thousand deferred stock units outstanding.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense.

Share-Based Awards Assumptions
We recognize the value of share-based compensation as expense in our consolidated statements of income during the vesting periods of the underlying share-based awards using the straight-line method. FASB ASC Topic 718 allows companies to estimate forfeitures of share-based awards at the time of grant and revise such estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from original projections.
The fair value of each share of restricted stock and restricted stock units to be settled in stock is equal to the fair market value of our common stock as of the date of grant, which is the closing price per share of our common stock on NASDAQ.

15. STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On February 20, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new stock repurchase program for up to $
50.0
 million which commenced March 1, 2024 and expires 
September 30, 2025
. The new stock repurchase program replaced the previous stock repurchase program. The other terms of the new stock repurchase program are consistent with the Company’s previous stock repurchase program.

The timing of purchases and the number of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the Company’s management and will depend on a variety of factors including stock price, trading volume and other general market and economic conditions, its assessment of alternative uses of capital, regulatory requirements and other factors. Repurchases will be made in open

99

market transactions, including block purchases, conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act as well as may be made pursuant to trading plans established under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, which would permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase shares and the Company may, in its discretion, begin, suspend or terminate repurchases at any time, without any prior notice.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 
0.4
 million shares of our common stock for approximately $
6.8
 million at an average price of $
17.60
 per share and during the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 
0.5
 million shares of our common stock for approximately $
8.3
 million at an average price of $
15.38
 per share. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
47.1
 million was available under our authorized stock repurchase program to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock. Shares of stock repurchased under the program are held as treasury shares. These repurchased shares have reduced the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

16. WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES
Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares assuming dilution. Dilutive common shares outstanding is computed using the Treasury Stock Method and reflects the additional shares that would be outstanding if dilutive stock options were exercised and restricted stock units were settled for common shares during the period.
The weighted average number of common shares used to compute basic and diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

For the Year Ended December 31,

2024

Diluted common shares outstanding

69,031

Certain unexercised stock option awards are excluded from our computations of diluted earnings per share, as these shares were out-of-the-money and their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the anti-dilutive options that were excluded from our computations of diluted earnings per share were 
0.1
 million and 
0.3
 million shares, respectively. There were 
no
 anti-dilutive options for the year ended December 31, 2024.

In addition to the common stock issued upon the exercise of employee stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units to be settled in stock, we issued less than 
0.1
 million shares for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan.

17. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Retirement Savings and Profit Sharing Plans
We maintain a defined contribution 401(k) retirement savings plan which is available to all employees who have worked greater than 
1,000 hours
 within a fiscal year. Under the plan, an eligible employee may elect to defer receipt of a portion of their annual pay, including salary and bonus. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we contributed this amount to the plan on the employee’s behalf and also made a matching contribution equal to 
50
% of the first 
2
% and 
25
% of the next 
4
% of the percentage of annual pay that the employee elected to defer. 
For employees hired on or after January 1, 2020, the participant is 
100
% vested in the company’s matching contribution after two years of service. Employees hired before January 1, 2020 are fully vested in the company’s matching contribution
. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded expense under this plan of approximately $
3.1
 million, $
3.6
 million, and $
3.1
 million, respectively.
Additionally, USAHS, which was acquired on December 2, 2024, offers a defined contribution 401(K) retirement savings plan to its employees. Under this plan, eligible employee may choose to defer a portion of their annual compensation, including salary and bonus. We make contributions on behalf of employees, including a matching contribution equal to 
50
% of the first 
6
% of eligible compensation an employee contributes to the benefit plan. The company match is discretionary and based on the USAHS' financial performance. Matching contributions are typically funded annually in the first quarter of each year.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We maintain an employee stock purchase plan that allows substantially all full-time and part-time employees to acquire shares of our common stock through payroll deductions over three-month offering periods. The per share purchase price is equal to 
95
% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the last day of the offering period, and purchases are limited to 
10
% of an employee’s salary, up to a maximum of $
25,000
 per calendar year. We are authorized to issue up to 
4.0
 million 
shares of common

100

stock 
under the employee stock purchase plan, and, as of December 31, 2024, 
3.5
 million shares of common stock have been issued under the plan.
The compensation expense for employee share purchases recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 in connection with the compensatory elements of our employee stock purchase plan was not significant.

18. SEGMENT REPORTING
Our segments are determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 280—
Segment Reporting
 and are based on how the Company's chief operating decision maker ("
CODM
") evaluates performance and allocates resources. Perdoceo's CODM as defined under ASC Topic 280 is its President and Chief Executive Officer. Each segment is comprised of an accredited postsecondary education institution that offers a variety of academic programs.

Our 
three
 reporting segments are described below.



Students pursue their degrees through fully-online programs, local campuses and blended formats, which combine campus-based and online education. 
As of December 31, 2024, students enrolled at CTU represented approximately 
68
% of our total enrollments. Approximately 
98
% of CTU’s students are enrolled in programs offered fully online. Students at CTU's ground-based campuses take both in-person and virtual classes.

The American InterContinental University System 
(AIUS or AIU System)
 is committed to providing industry-relevant higher education opportunities for a diverse student population, including non-traditional adult learners and the military community. AIUS places emphasis on the educational, professional and academic growth of each student. AIUS offers academic programs in the career-oriented disciplines of business studies, information technologies, education, behavioral sciences and criminal justice. Students pursue their degrees through fully-online programs, local campuses and blended formats, which combine campus-based and online education.

9
% of our total enrollment
s. Approxim
ately 
14
% of 
USAHS students are enrolled in fully online programs.  

We evaluate segment performance based on operating results, specifically our CODM analyzes segment revenue and operating expenses which are directly attributable to the cost to serve and educate prospective students, when making decisions to allocate resources based on segment performance. Adjustments to reconcile segment results to consolidated results are included under the caption “Corporate and Other,” which primarily includes unallocated corporate activity and eliminations. Substantially all revenue earned by our reporting segments are generated in the United States of America (“
U.S
.”) and segment and total assets are substantially held in the U.S. Additionally, interest income, interest expense and other miscellaneous non-operating income (expense) are not material by segment and are not reviewed by our CODM by segment.
