Financial Operations Overview

Revenues

To date, we have not generated any revenue. We do not expect to receive any revenue from any drug candidates that we develop unless and until we obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize, our drug candidates or enter into collaborative agreements with third parties.

Research and Development Expenses

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $101.6 million in research and development expenses primarily related to our efforts in conducting the VK2735 Phase 2 VENTURE clinical trial, the VK2735 Phase 1 subcutaneous clinical trial, the VK2735 Phase 1 oral clinical trial, VK2809 Phase 2b VOYAGE clinical trial and the VK0214 Phase 1b clinical trial. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $63.8 million in research and development expenses primarily related to our efforts in conducting the VK2735 Phase 2 VENTURE clinical trial, the VK2735 Phase 1 subcutaneous clinical trial, VK2809 Phase 2b VOYAGE clinical trial and the VK0214 Phase 1b clinical trial. We expect that our ongoing research and development expenses will consist of costs incurred for the development of our drug candidates, including, but not limited to:

•
employee and consultant-related expenses, which will include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, and certain consultant fees and travel expenses;

•
expenses incurred under agreements with investigative sites and CROs, which will conduct a substantial portion of our research and development activities, including studies in NASH/MASH, on our behalf;

•
payments to third-party manufacturers, which will produce our active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products;

•
license fees paid to third parties for use of their intellectual property; and

•
facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which will include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and equipment, depreciation of leasehold improvements, equipment and laboratory and other supplies.

We expense all research and development costs as incurred.

The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming and the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. Our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of each of our drug candidates, as well as ongoing assessments of the commercial potential of such drug candidates. In addition, we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which drug candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. We expect to incur increased research and development expenses in the future as we continue our efforts towards advancing our VK2735 subcutaneous, VK2735 oral, VK2809 and VK0214 programs and seek to advance our additional programs.

General and Administrative Expenses

Our general and administrative expenses have generally increased year-over-year as we have hired additional employees, issued additional equity awards, which has resulted in increased stock-based compensation expense, implemented certain systems to increase efficiency, and incurred additional costs for insurance, legal and accounting related to operating as a public company. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future in order to support our expected increase in research and development activities, including increased salaries and other related costs, stock-based compensation and consulting fees for executive, finance, accounting and business development functions. We also expect general and administrative expenses to increase as a result of additional costs associated with being a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administration and professional services. Other significant costs are expected to include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, and fees for accounting and other consulting services.

Other Income (Expense)

Other income (expense) includes interest income earned from our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to our preclinical, nonclinical and clinical development costs and drug manufacturing costs. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies will be critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements.

Research and Development

All costs of research and development are expensed in the period incurred. Research and development costs primarily consist of fees paid to contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, employee and consultant related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for research and development personnel, external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third-party manufacturing organizations, facilities costs, travel costs, dues and subscriptions, depreciation and materials used in preclinical studies, clinical trials and research and development.

We estimate our preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services we received pursuant to contracts with research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. Clinical trial-related contracts vary significantly in length, and may be for a fixed amount, based on milestones or deliverables, a variable amount based on actual costs incurred, capped at a certain limit, or for a combination of these elements. We accrue service fees based on work performed, which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on milestones achieved, patient enrollment and other events. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears, and to the extent that amounts invoiced differ from our estimates of expenses incurred, we accrue for additional costs. The financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven expenses and payment flows. Preclinical study and clinical trial expenses include:

•
fees paid to CROs, consultants and laboratories in connection with preclinical studies;

•
fees paid to CROs, clinical trial sites, investigators and consultants in connection with clinical trials; and

•
fees paid to contract manufacturers and service providers in connection with the production, testing and packaging of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials.

Payments under some of these agreements depend on factors such as the milestones accomplished, including enrollment of certain numbers of patients, site initiation and the completion of clinical trial milestones. To date, we have not experienced any events requiring us to make material adjustments to our accruals for service fees. If we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations. Adjustments to our accruals are recorded as changes in estimates become evident. Furthermore, based on amounts invoiced to us by our service providers, we may also record payments made to those providers as prepaid expenses that will be recognized as expense in future periods as services are rendered.

In May 2014, we entered into the Master License Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired certain rights to a number of research and development programs from Ligand. In doing so, we updated our policy on research and development to include the purchase of rights to intangible assets. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 730, 
Research and Development,
 intangible assets that are acquired and have an alternative future use, as defined, should be capitalized and reported as an intangible asset; however, the cost of acquired intangible assets that do not have alternative future uses should be reported as research and development expense as incurred. We note that intangible assets acquired that are in the preclinical or clinical stages of development when acquired, and not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, are deemed to have not satisfied the definition of having an alternative future use, as defined. Accordingly, assets acquired in the preclinical and clinical stages of development are expensed as incurred in our statement of operations.

64

Stock-Based Compensation

We generally use the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each optionee’s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, and estimate the fair value of stock-based awards or restricted stock units to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including volatility, the expected term and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs. For restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, we generally use the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over the holder’s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, and use the fair value at grant date to value the awards. For restricted stock that vests upon the satisfaction of certain performance conditions, we recognize stock-based compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be met. At the grant date, we determine the grant date fair value, as a publicly traded company, using the intrinsic value, or the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. At the point where the criteria are deemed probable of being met, we record stock-based compensation with a cumulative catch-up expense in the period first recognized and then on a straight-line basis over the remaining period for which the performance criteria are expected to be completed.

For our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, we generally recognize compensation expense for the fair value of the purchase options, as measured on the grant date, and use the graded vesting method to allocate this compensation cost to each purchase period within the related two-year offering period. As our ESPP also allows for up to one increase in contributions during each purchase period, if an employee elects to increase their contributions, we treat this as an accounting modification. The pre- and post-modification values are calculated on the date of the modification, and the incremental expense is then amortized over the remaining purchase periods.

Income Taxes

We account for our income taxes using the liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the basis used for financial reporting and income tax reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes are provided based on the enacted tax rates in effect at the time such temporary differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that we will not realize those tax assets through future operations.

ASC Topic 740-10, 
Income Taxes
, clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met.

Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022

For a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, please refer to the discussion under the heading “Results of Operations—Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022” in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 7, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations and have not generated any revenues since our inception. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $902.6 million. As such, we believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the first quarter of 2026, which is more than one year after the date our December 31, 2024 financial statements were issued.

Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which to date have consisted of the cost to obtain the license of intellectual property from Ligand, certain research and development expenses related to furthering the development of VK2735 subcutaneous, VK2735 oral, VK2809, VK0214 and VK5211, and general and administrative expenses. Since we have not generated any revenues to date, we have incurred operating losses since our inception. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of payment of these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.

On July 28, 2021, we entered into an At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement, or the ATM Agreement, with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Truist Securities, Inc. and H.C. Wainwright & Co. LLC, collectively, the Agents, pursuant to which we could offer and sell, from time to time, through or to the Agents, as sales agent or principal, or the ATM Offering, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $125.0 million, or the ATM Shares. Any ATM Shares offered and sold in the ATM Offering were to be issued pursuant to a universal Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-258231), or the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement, and the 424(b) prospectus supplement relating to the ATM Offering dated August 11, 2021. From its inception through the expiration of the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement in July 2023, 1,587,404 shares of our common stock were sold pursuant to the ATM Offering for aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately $13.6 million.

On March 17, 2020, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program, or the Prior Repurchase Program, whereby we could purchase up to $50.0 million in shares of our common stock and outstanding warrants to purchase our common stock, over a period of up to two years. The Prior Repurchase Program was carried out at the discretion of a committee of our board of directors through open market purchases, one or more Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, block trades or privately negotiated transactions. Through March 17, 2022, the termination date of the Prior Repurchase Program, we repurchased an aggregate of 1,464,217 shares of our common stock under the

66

Prior Repurchase Program. These shares repurchased by us under the Prior Repurchase Program were held in treasury and reissued by us as part of the March 2024 Offering (as defined below).

On March 10, 2022, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program, or the Repurchase Program, effective March 18, 2022, whereby we could purchase up to $50.0 million in shares of our common stock over a period of up to two years. The Repurchase Program was carried out at the discretion of a committee of our board of directors through open market purchases, one or more Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, block trades and in privately negotiated transactions. Through March 18, 2024, the termination date of the Repurchase Program, we repurchased an aggregate of 729,034 shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program. Shares repurchased by us under the Repurchase Program were held in treasury and reissued by us as part of the March 2024 Offering.

On April 3, 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock, or the April 2023 Offering, pursuant to the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement. In the April 2023 Offering, we sold an aggregate of 19,828,300 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $14.50 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 2,586,300 additional shares of common stock. Upon the closing of the April 2023 Offering, we received gross proceeds of $287.5 million.

On July 26, 2023, we filed an automatic universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-273460) as a well-known seasoned issuer as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which became effective upon filing, or the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement. The 2023 Shelf Registration Statement allows us to offer an indeterminate amount of securities, including equity securities, debt securities, warrants, rights, units and depositary shares, from time to time as described in the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement. The specific terms of any offering under the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement will be established at the time of such offering. The 2023 Shelf Registration Statement will expire on July 26, 2026.

On July 26, 2023, we entered into an Amendment No. 1 to At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement, or the ATM Agreement Amendment, with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Truist Securities, Inc., H.C. Wainwright & Co. LLC and BTIG, LLC. Pursuant to the ATM Agreement Amendment, BTIG, LLC was added as a sales agent for the ATM Offering and the ATM Agreement was amended to provide that the ATM Offering could be conducted off of registration statements on Form S-3 subsequently filed by us. Any ATM Shares offered and sold in the ATM Offering will now be issued pursuant to the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus, dated July 26, 2023, relating to the sale of up to $200.0 million of shares of our common stock pursuant to the ATM Offering that was included in the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement, or the ATM Prospectus. The 2023 Shelf Registration Statement will expire on July 26, 2026. From the date of the ATM Prospectus through December 31, 2024, 1,426,303 shares of our common stock were sold pursuant to the ATM Offering and, as of December 31, 2024, we may sell shares of our common stock for remaining gross proceeds of up to $151.9 million from time to time pursuant to the ATM Prospectus.

On March 4, 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock, or the March 2024 Offering, pursuant to the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement. In the March 2024 Offering, we sold an aggregate of 7,441,650 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $85.00 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 970,650 additional shares of common stock. Upon the closing of the March 2024 Offering, we received net proceeds of $597.1 million.

In February 2025, subsequent to the fiscal year end, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program effective February 27, 2025, whereby we may purchase up to $250.0 million in shares of our common stock over a period of up to two years. See “Stock Repurchase Program” under Part II, Item 9B of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in operating activities of $87.8 million primarily reflected our net losses for the period, adjusted by non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation, amortization of investment premiums, amortization of right-of-use assets, realized gain on investment, amortization of financing costs, and interest expense related to operating lease liabilities as well as changes in our working capital accounts, primarily consisting of an increase in accrued expenses, accounts payable and accrued interest, net of interest received on maturity of investments, partially offset by decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets and lease liability.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in operating activities of $73.4 million primarily reflected our net losses for the period, adjusted by non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation, amortization of investment premiums, amortization of right-of-use assets, amortization of financing costs, and interest expense related to operating lease liabilities as well as changes in our working capital accounts, primarily consisting of an increase in accrued interest, net of interest received on maturity of investments, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and lease liability.

Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities of $553.4 million resulted from the purchase of investments of $1.1 billion, offset by the proceeds of maturities of investments of $560.0 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities of $179.1 million resulted from the purchase of investments of $478.3 million, offset by the proceeds of maturities of investments of $299.2 million.

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $612.5 million, which consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock, net of discount, of $597.1 million in the March 2024 Offering, proceeds from certain option exercises and 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan common stock issuance of $10.8 million and proceeds from the ATM Offering, net of fees, of $46.7 million, partially offset by value of shares withheld to cover taxes of $42.1 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $271.4 million, which consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock, net of discount, of $269.8 million in the April 2023 Offering, proceeds from certain option exercises of $6.8 million and proceeds from the ATM Offering, net of fees, of $2.0 million, partially offset by value of shares withheld to cover taxes of $7.1 million.

Future Funding Requirements

As of December 31, 2024, and based upon our current operating plan, we believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months following the issuance of the financial statements. We anticipate, however, that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase materially as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our drug candidates, and seek to commercialize any drugs for which we receive regulatory approval. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and complete our ongoing and planned clinical trials. Although we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings, funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:

•
the scope, rate of progress, results and costs of our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other related activities;

68

•
our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;

•
the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our current or future drug candidates;

•
the number and characteristics of the drug candidates we seek to develop or commercialize;

•
the cost of manufacturing clinical supplies, and establishing commercial supplies, of our drug candidates;

•
the cost of commercialization activities if any of our current or future drug candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;

•
the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;

•
the costs associated with being a public company;

•
the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our drug candidates, should any of our drug candidates receive marketing approval; and

•
the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing possible patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of any such litigation.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitati
ve Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rate Risk

Financial Instruments

As part of our investment portfolio, we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks. The investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital, provide adequate liquidity and earn returns commensurate with our risk appetite. We invest in instruments that meet the credit quality standards outlined in our investment policy, which also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or type of instrument. These instruments principally include securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, investment-grade corporate bonds and commercial paper, and money market funds. These investments are denominated in U.S. Dollars and none are held for trading purposes.

All of our interest-bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and could change in value if interest rates fluctuate. Substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity, and we have implemented guidelines limiting the term-to-maturity of our investment instruments. Since we account for these securities as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are realized due to changes in the fair value of our investments unless we sell our investments prior to maturity or incur a credit loss. Due to the conservative nature of these instruments, we do not believe that the fair value of our investments has a material exposure to interest rate risk.

While we are exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, our investment portfolio is most affected by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, which affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income generated from our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments – available-for-sale will vary with the general level of interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve in 2024 and 2023 would increase or decrease our interest rate yields on our investments by approximately $0.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively.

Item 9A. Controls
 and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Based on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of the individuals serving as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer) of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, each of the individuals serving as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the individuals serving as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this

70

assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Attestation Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Marcum LLP, issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, as noted below.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Viking Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Viking Therapeutics, Inc.'s (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows and the related notes for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting”. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention

71

or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Regist
ered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of

Viking Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).  In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013 and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Accrual for preclinical study and clinical trial costs

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company estimates its preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services it received pursuant to contracts with research institutions and contract research organizations (“CROs”) that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on the Company’s behalf. Clinical trial-related contracts vary significantly in length, and may be for a fixed amount based on milestones or deliverables, a variable amount based on actual costs incurred, capped at a certain limit, or a combination of these elements. The Company accrues service fees based on work performed, which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on milestones achieved, patient enrollment and other events. The majority of the Company’s service providers invoice the Company in arrears, and to the extent that amounts invoiced differ from its estimates of expenses incurred, the Company accrues for additional costs. The financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven expenses and payment flows.

F-
2

The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures related to the preclinical study and clinical trial expenses, specifically related to the year-end accrual for preclinical study and clinical trial costs, is a critical audit matter is that there was judgment by management in determining the achievement of milestones, patient enrollments and occurrence of other events that creates a present obligation for the Company to pay the research institutions and CROs for their services.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) obtaining an understanding of the Company’s estimation process relating to accrual for preclinical study and clinical trial costs; (ii) testing management’s identification of milestones, patient enrollment requirements and other events in its contracts with the research institutions and CROs; (iii) testing management’s determination of the accrual for preclinical study and clinical trial costs for a sample of such milestones, patient enrollments and other events; and (iv) testing the mathematical accuracy of the schedule of accrual for preclinical study and clinical trial costs prepared by management.

Viking Therapeutics, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financ
ial Statements

1.
Organization, Liquidity and Management’s Plan, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
Viking Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiary (the “Company”), is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders. In June of 2021, the company formed an Australian subsidiary, Viking Therapeutics, PTY LTD, so as to be able to take advantage of certain research and development reimbursements available to local Australian based research and development companies that choose to do research in Australia.
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of 
Delaware
 on 
September 24, 2012
 and its principal executive offices are located in San Diego, CA, with a subsidiary located in Adelaide, Australia.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements. Significant estimates made in preparing these financial statements relate to accounting for accruals for our clinical and preclinical efforts and stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary, Viking Therapeutics, PTY LTD, incorporated in Australia. To date, the aggregate operations of this subsidiary have not been significant and all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of 
three months or less
 from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Investments Available-for-Sale
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are included in other income (expense). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. The Company maintains deposits in federally insured depository institutions in excess of federally insured limits. Management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held. Additionally, the Company has established guidelines regarding approved investments and maturities of investments, which are designed to maintain safety and liquidity.

F-

Prepaid Clinical Trial and Preclinical Study Costs
Prepaid clinical trial and preclinical study costs represent advance payments by the Company for future clinical trial and preclinical study services to be performed by the clinical research organization and other research organizations. Such amounts are recognized as research and development expense as the related clinical trial and preclinical study services are performed.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, and lease liability obligations are included in the Company’s balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability obligations represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company uses the implicit rate when readily determinable. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and lease direct costs. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Please refer to Note 5 for additional information.
Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs represent legal, accounting and other direct costs related to the Company’s efforts to raise capital through a public or private sale of the Company’s common stock. Costs related to the public sale of the Company’s common stock are deferred until the completion of the applicable offering, at which time such costs are reclassified to additional paid-in-capital as a reduction of the proceeds. Costs related to the private sale of the Company’s common stock are deferred until the completion of the applicable offering, at which time such costs are amortized over the term of the applicable purchase agreement.
Revenue Recognition
The Company has not recorded any revenues since its inception. However, in the future, the Company may enter into collaborative research and licensing agreements, under which the Company could be eligible for payments made in the form of upfront license fees, research funding, cost reimbursement, contingent event-based payments and/or royalties.
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
 and all related amendments (“ASC 606” or “the revenue standard”). ASC 606 is a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The revenue standard is based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, ASC 606 provides that an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The revenue standard also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, and costs to obtain or fulfill contracts. The Company will apply ASC 606 prospectively to all contracts.
Research and Development Expenses
All costs of research and development are expensed in the period incurred. Research and development costs primarily consist of fees paid to CROs and clinical trial sites, employee and consultant related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for research and development personnel, external research and development expenses incurred pursuant to agreements with third-party manufacturing organizations, facilities costs, travel costs, dues and subscriptions, depreciation and materials used in preclinical studies, clinical trials and research and development.

F-

The Company estimates its preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on the services it received pursuant to contracts with research institutions and CROs that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on the Company’s behalf. Clinical trial-related contracts vary significantly in length, and may be for a fixed amount based on milestones or deliverables, a variable amount based on actual costs incurred, capped at a certain limit, or a combination of these elements. The Company accrues service fees based on work performed, which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on milestones achieved, patient enrollment and other events. The majority of the Company’s service providers invoice the Company in arrears, and to the extent that amounts invoiced differ from its estimates of expenses incurred, the Company accrues for additional costs. The financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven expenses and payment flows. Preclinical study and clinical trial expenses include:
•
fees paid to CROs, consultants and laboratories in connection with preclinical studies;
•
fees paid to CROs, clinical trial sites, investigators and consultants in connection with clinical trials; and
•
fees paid to contract manufacturers and service providers in connection with the production, testing and packaging of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials.
Payments under some of these agreements depend on factors such as the milestones accomplished, including enrollment of certain numbers of patients, site initiation and the completion of clinical trial milestones. To date, the Company has not experienced any events requiring it to make material adjustments to its accruals for service fees. If the Company does not identify costs that it has begun to incur or if it underestimates or overestimates the level of services performed or the costs of these services, its actual expenses could differ from its estimates which could materially affect its results of operations. Adjustments to the Company’s accruals are recorded as changes in estimates become evident. Furthermore, based on amounts invoiced to the Company by its service providers, the Company may also record payments made to those providers as prepaid expenses that will be recognized as expense in future periods as services are rendered.
Related to the Company’s Australian subsidiary, Viking Therapeutics, PTY LTD, the Company is eligible to receive under the AusIndustry Research and Tax Development Tax Incentive Program, an amount of cash from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). The annual tax incentive is available to the Company on the basis of specific criteria with which the Company must comply related to research and development expenditures in Australia. As there is no specific GAAP guidance related to how to record this research and development tax incentive, the Company looked to International Accounting Standard (IAS) 20 and determined that it will recognize these research and development tax incentives as contra research and development expense once received. The amounts are determined based on a cost-reimbursement basis, and the incentive is related to the Company’s research and development expenditures and is due regardless of whether any Australian tax is owed.
Patent Costs
Costs related to filing and pursuing patent applications are expensed as incurred to general and administrative expense, as recoverability of such expenditures is uncertain.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company generally uses the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each optionee’s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, and estimates the fair value of stock-based awards or restricted stock units to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model (the “Black-Scholes model”). The Black-Scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including volatility, the expected term and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs. For restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, the Company generally uses the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over the holder’s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, and uses the fair value at grant date to value the awards. For restricted stock that vests upon the satisfaction of certain performance conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be met. At the grant date, the Company determines the grant date fair value, as a publicly traded company, using the intrinsic value, or the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. At the point where the criteria are deemed probable of being met, the Company records stock-based compensation with a cumulative catch-up expense in the period first recognized and then on a straight-line basis over the remaining period for which the performance criteria are expected to be completed.
For 
the Company’s 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2014 ESPP”) and 2024 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which replaced the 2014 ESPP (the “2024 ESPP” and, together with the 2014 ESPP, the “ESPPs”), the Company generally recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the purchase options, as measured on the grant date, and uses the graded vesting method to allocate this compensation cost to each purchase period within the related two-year offering period. As the 2014 ESPP allowed and the 2024 ESPP

F-
10

allows 
for up to one increase in contributions during each purchase period, as an employee elects to increase his or her contributions, the Company treats this as an accounting modification. The pre- and post-modification values are calculated on the date of the modification, and the incremental expense is then amortized over the remaining purchase periods.

Income Taxes
The Company accounts for its income taxes using the liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the basis used for financial reporting and income tax reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes are provided based on the enacted tax rates in effect at the time such temporary differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize those tax assets through future operations.
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740-10, 
Income Taxes
, clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the Company’s financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Foreign Currency
The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiary whose functional currency is the local currency is translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation as follows: assets and liabilities at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, stockholders’ equity at the historical rates of exchange, and income and expense amounts at the average exchange rate for the period. Translation adjustments resulting from the translation of the subsidiaries’ accounts are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” as equity in the consolidated balance sheet. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates.
Comprehensive Loss
The Company’s comprehensive loss consists of net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments arising from the consolidation of the Company’s foreign subsidiary.
Net Loss per Common Share
Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common share equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. For purposes of this calculation, the Company currently does not have any deemed common share equivalents; therefore, its basic and diluted net loss per share calculations are the same.
The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net loss per common share (in thousands, except share and per share data):

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires all public entities, including public entities with a single reportable segment, to provide in interim and annual periods one or more measures of segment profit or loss used by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance. Additionally, the standard requires disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items as well as incremental qualitative disclosures.
The Company 
adopted
 ASU 2023-07 effective 
December 31, 2024
, on a retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not change the way that the Company identifies its reportable segments and, as a result, 
did not have a material impact
 on the Company’s segment-related disclosures. Refer to Note 12 for further information on the Company’s reportable segment.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as information related to income taxes paid to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This ASU will be effective for the annual period ending December 31, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and impact of adoption of this ASU.

Investments in Marketable Securities
The Company’s investment strategy is focused on capital preservation. The Company invests in instruments that meet the credit quality standards outlined in the Company’s investment policy. This policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or type of instrument. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s investments were in money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities and government debt securities. There were 
no
 sales of available-for-sale securities during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Investments classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2024 consisted of the following (in thousands):

Company reviews its investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible other-than-temporary impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, investments and accounts payable. The carrying amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
Level 1
 —Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
 —Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3
 —Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, all of the Company’s financial assets that were subject to fair value measurements were valued using observable inputs. The Company’s financial assets valued based on Level 1 inputs consist of money market funds and certificates of deposit. The Company’s financial assets valued based on Level 2 inputs consist of corporate debt securities, which consist of investments in highly-rated investment-grade corporations, and government debt securities.

The Company’s investment strategy is focused on capital preservation. The Company invests in instruments that meet the credit quality standards outlined in the Company’s investment policy. This policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or type of instrument. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s investments were in government money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities and government debt securities.

Pursuant to the terms of the Master License Agreement, the Company has the exclusive right and sole responsibility and decision-making authority for researching and developing any pharmaceutical products that contain or comprise one or any combination of the technology and compounds licensed from Ligand pursuant to the Master License Agreement (the “Licensed Products”). The Company also has the exclusive right and sole responsibility and decision-making authority to conduct all clinical trials and preclinical studies that the Company believes are appropriate to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for commercialization of the Licensed Products, and the Company will own and maintain all regulatory filings and all regulatory approvals for the Licensed Products. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Master License Agreement, the Company has the sole decision-making authority and responsibility and the exclusive right to commercialize any of the Licensed Products, either by itself or, in certain circumstances, through sublicensees selected by the Company. The Company also has the exclusive right to manufacture or have manufactured any Licensed Product itself or, in certain circumstances, through sublicensees or third parties selected by the Company. The Company will own any intellectual property that it develops in connection with the license granted under the Master License Agreement.
As partial consideration for the grant of the rights and licenses to the Company under the Master License Agreement, the Company issued to Ligand at the closing of the Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) 
3,655,964
 shares of its common stock having an estimated aggregate value of $
29.2
 million.

As further partial consideration for the grant of the rights and licenses to the Company by Ligand under the Master License Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay to Ligand certain one-time, non-refundable milestone payments in connection with the Licensed Products of up to $
1.54
 billion in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. The Company will also pay to Ligand royalties on aggregate annual worldwide net sales of Licensed Products by the Company, its affiliates and its sublicensees at tiered percentage rates from the low-to-upper single digits based upon net sales.
The term of the Master License Agreement will continue unless the agreement is terminated by the Company or Ligand, and each of the Company and Ligand have the right to terminate the Master License Agreement in certain circumstances, including, without limitation, if the other party defaults on certain of its obligations under the Master License Agreement.

F-

Ligand has the right to terminate the Master License Agreement under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: (1) in the event of the Company’s insolvency or bankruptcy, (2) if the Company does not pay an undisputed amount owing under the Master License Agreement when due and fails to cure such default within a specified period of time, or (3) if the Company defaults on certain of its material and substantial obligations and fails to cure the default within a specified period of time. The Company has the right to terminate the Master License Agreement under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) if Ligand does not pay an undisputed amount owing under the Master License Agreement when due and fails to cure such default within a specified period of time, or (ii) if Ligand defaults on certain of its material and substantial obligations and fails to cure the default within a specified period of time. In addition, provisions of the Master License Agreement can be terminated on a licensed program-by-program basis under certain circumstances. In the event that the Master License Agreement is terminated in its entirety or with respect to a specific licensed program for any reason: (A) all licenses granted to the Company under the Master License Agreement (or with respect to the specific licensed program) will terminate and the Company will, upon Ligand’s request (subject to Ligand assuming legal responsibility for any clinical trials of the Licensed Products then ongoing), assign and transfer to Ligand (or to such transferee as Ligand may direct), at 
no
 cost to Ligand, all regulatory documentation and all regulatory approvals prepared or obtained by the Company or on its behalf related to the Licensed Products (or those related to the specific licensed program), or, if Ligand does not make such a request, the Company will wind down any ongoing clinical trials with respect to the Licensed Products (or those related to the specific licensed program) at no cost to Ligand; (B) the Company will, upon Ligand’s request, sell and transfer to Ligand (or to such transferee as Ligand may direct), at a price equal to 
125
% of the Company’s costs of goods, any and all chemical, biological or physical materials relating to or comprising the Licensed Products (or those related to the specific licensed program); (C) the Company will have, for a period of six months following termination, the right to sell on the normal business terms in existence before such termination any finished commercial inventory of Licensed Products (or those related to the specific licensed program) which remains on hand, so long as the Company pays to Ligand the applicable royalties and sales milestones; (D) Ligand has the right to require the Company to assign to Ligand the trademarks owned by the Company relating to the Licensed Products (or those related to the specific licensed program); and (E) the Company will grant to Ligand a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing sublicensable license under any patent rights and know-how controlled by the Company to the extent necessary to make, have made, import, use, offer to sell and sell the Licensed Products (or those related to the specific licensed program) anywhere in the world at a royalty rate in the low single digits.
Under the Master License Agreement, the Company has agreed to indemnify Ligand for claims relating to the performance of the Company’s obligations under the Master License Agreement, any breach of the representations and warranties made by the Company under the Master License Agreement, clinical trials conducted by the Company and the research, development and commercialization of the Licensed Products by the Company and its affiliates, sublicensees, distributors and agents. In addition, Ligand has agreed to indemnify the Company for claims relating to the performance of its obligations under the Master License Agreement, its breach of representations and warranties under the agreement and its research and development of the licensed compounds before the effective date of the Master License Agreement. Each party’s indemnification obligations will not apply to the extent the claims result from the negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified party or any of its employees, agents, officers or directors or from the indemnified party’s breach of its representations or warranties set forth in the Master License Agreement.
In May 2014, the Company also entered into a Management Rights Letter (the “Management Rights Letter”) with Ligand that required the Company to expand the size of the Company’s Board of Directors to create an additional directorship on the Company’s Board of Directors and to allow Ligand to appoint an individual to fill the new directorship. On 
March 28, 2023
, the Management Rights Letter terminated upon the date that Ligand ceased to beneficially own at least 
7.5
% of the Company’s outstanding voting stock.

five years
 beyond the Term.
 If the option is exercised, the renewal term will be upon the same terms and conditions as the original Office Lease, except that the base rent will be equal to the prevailing market rate as determined pursuant to the terms of the Office Lease. The option to extend the term of the Office Lease was recognized as part of the Company’s lease liability and right-of-use assets.

Stockholders’ Equity 
Preferred Stock
The Company is authorized to issue up to 
10,000,000
 shares of $
0.00001
 par value preferred stock, with 
no
 shares of preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to designate the terms and conditions of any preferred stock the Company issues without further action by the common stockholders.
Common Stock
The Company is authorized to issue up to 
300,000,000
 shares of common stock, $
0.00001
 par value per share.
In February 2014, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with one of its founders. The agreement provided for the purchase of 
1,000,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price per share of $
0.01
 in exchange for future services to be rendered to the Company as measured by certain performance criteria. The shares were subject to a repurchase option and were to vest in 
two
 tranches of 
500,000
 shares each, upon achievement of the performance target or upon a triggering event as defined.

F-
16

The Company determined that the fair value of the unrecognized expense was $
168,000
 at February 20, 2014, the grant date. In May 2015, the Company repurchased 
633,810
 of these shares at a purchase price of $
0.00001
 per share. In connection with the repurchase, the Company entered into an amendment to the stock purchase agreement to provide that the remaining 
366,190
 shares will continue to vest in 
two
 tranches of 
183,095
 shares each, upon achievement of the performance target or upon a triggering event as defined. The pro rata grant date fair value of the unrecognized expense is $
62,000
. In October 2015, a triggering event became probable of occurrence and was deemed achieved in October 2016; therefore, the Company recorded $
31,000
 of stock-based compensation expense through December 31, 2016. 
No
 similar expense was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The Company will continue to reassess at each reporting period whether it is probable that the performance target will be achieved, and if and when it is deemed probable, the Company will begin to record compensation expense using the fair value to determine stock-based compensation expense in its financial statements over the period the Company estimates the performance target will actually be achieved.
On July 28, 2021, the Company entered into an At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the “ATM Agreement”), with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Truist Securities, Inc. and H.C. Wainwright & Co. LLC (collectively, the “Agents”), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through or to the Agents, as sales agent or principal (the “ATM Offering”), shares of the Company’s common stock (the “ATM Shares”). Any ATM Shares offered and sold in the ATM Offering were to be issued pursuant to the Company’s universal Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-258231) (the “2021 Shelf Registration Statement”) and the 424(b) prospectus supplement relating to the ATM Offering dated August 11, 2021. The 2021 Shelf Registration Statement terminated on July 26, 2023. From its inception through the termination of the 2021 Shelf Registration Statement, 
1,587,404
 shares of the Company’s common stock were sold pursuant to the ATM Offering for aggregate net proceeds to the Company of approximately $
13.6
 million.
On March 10, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program effective March 18, 2022, whereby the Company could purchase up to $
50.0
 million in shares of its common stock over a period of up to 
two years
 (the “Repurchase Program”). The Repurchase Program was to be carried out at the discretion of a committee of the Company’s Board of Directors through open market purchases, one or more Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, block trades and in privately negotiated transactions. Through 
March 18, 2024
, the termination date of the Repurchase Program, an aggregate of 
729,034
 shares of the Company’s common stock were repurchased by the Company under the Repurchase Program. Shares repurchased by the Company under the Repurchase Program were held in treasury and reissued by the Company as part of the March 2024 Offering (as defined below).

19,828,300
 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $
14.50
 per share, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 
2,586,300
 additional shares of common stock. Upon the closing of the April 2023 Offering, the Company received net proceeds of $
270.0
 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses.

On July 26, 2023, the Company filed an automatic universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-273460) as a well-known seasoned issuer as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which became effective upon filing (the “2023 Shelf Registration Statement”). The 2023 Shelf Registration Statement allows the Company to offer an indeterminate amount of securities, including equity securities, debt securities, warrants, rights, units and depositary shares, from time to time as described in the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement. The specific terms of any offering under the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement will be established at the time of such offering. The 2023 Shelf Registration Statement will expire on 
July 26, 2026
.

On July 26, 2023, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 1 to At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the “ATM Agreement Amendment”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Truist Securities, Inc., H.C. Wainwright & Co. LLC and BTIG, LLC. Pursuant to the ATM Agreement Amendment, BTIG, LLC was added as a sales agent for the ATM Offering and the ATM Agreement was amended to provide that the ATM Offering could be conducted off of registration statements on Form S-3 subsequently filed by the Company. Any ATM Shares offered and sold in the ATM Offering will now be issued pursuant to the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus, dated July 26, 2023, relating to the sale of up to $
200.0
 million of shares of our common stock pursuant to the ATM Offering, that was included in the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement (the “ATM Prospectus”). The 2023 Shelf Registration Statement will expire on 
July 26, 2026
. From the date of the ATM Prospectus through December 31, 2024, 
1,426,303
 shares of the Company’s common stock were sold pursuant to the ATM Offering and, as of December 31, 2024, the Company may sell shares of its common stock for remaining gross proceeds of up to $

168,332
, 
180,174

Stock-Based Compensation
In connection with the IPO, the Company’s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and the 2014 ESPP became effective on April 28, 2015, the date of the execution and delivery of the underwriting agreement for the IPO. A total of 
1,527,770
 shares of the Company’s common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan, and 
458,331
 shares of the Company’s common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the 2014 ESPP. From January 1, 2016 and through December 31, 2024, in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Plan, an additional 
15,407,065
 shares of the Company’s common stock were added to the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan, and, in accordance with the terms of the 2014 ESPP, an additional 
4,402,017
 shares of the Company’s common stock were added to the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2014 ESPP.
The Company generally uses the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each optionee’s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, and estimates the fair value of stock-based awards or restricted stock units to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model. The Black-Scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including volatility, the expected term and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant, among other inputs. For restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards, the Company generally uses the straight-line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over the holder’s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, and uses the fair value at grant date to value the awards. For restricted stock that vests upon the satisfaction of certain performance conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be met. At the grant date, the Company determines the grant date fair value, as a publicly traded company, using the intrinsic value, or the closing price of its common stock on the date of grant. At the point where the criteria are deemed probable of being met, the Company records stock-based compensation with a cumulative catch-up expense in the period first recognized and then on a straight-line basis over the remaining period for which the performance criteria are expected to be completed.
For the 2014 ESPP and 2024 ESPP, the Company generally recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the purchase options, as measured on the grant date, and uses the graded vesting method to allocate this compensation cost to each purchase period within the related two-year offering period. As the 2014 ESPP previously allowed, and the 2024 ESPP currently allows, for up to one increase in contributions during each purchase period, then as an employee elects to increase their contributions, the Company treats this as an accounting modification. The pre- and post-modification values are calculated on the date of the modification, and the incremental expense is then amortized over the remaining purchase periods.
2014 Plan.
 The Company’s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) provided that the compensation committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) could grant or issue stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units and unrestricted shares, deferred share units, performance and cash-settled awards and dividend equivalent rights to participants under the 2014 Plan. 
Initially, a total of 
1,527,770
 shares of the Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2014 Plan. The 2014 Plan provided that the number of shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan would, unless otherwise determined by the Company’s Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, be automatically increased on January 1 of each year commencing on January 1, 2016 and ended on (and including) January 1, 2024, in an amount equal to 
3.5
% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year.
 The shares of common stock deliverable pursuant to awards under the 2014 Plan are authorized but unissued shares of the Company’s common stock, or shares of the Company’s common stock that the Company otherwise holds in treasury or in trust. The 2014 Plan provided that any shares of the Company’s common stock underlying awards that are settled in cash or otherwise expire, or are forfeited, terminated or cancelled (including pursuant to an exchange program established by the Compensation Committee) prior to the issuance of stock would again be available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. In addition, shares of the Company’s common stock that are withheld (or not issued) in payment of the exercise price or taxes relating to an award, and shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the number surrendered in payment of any exercise price or withholding taxes relating to an award, would again be available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. As of December 31, 2023, there were 
5,939,750
 shares of the Company’s common stock available for issuance and, effective January 1, 2024, an additional 
3,503,981
 shares of the Company’s common stock were added to the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Plan.
2024 Plan. 
On May 21, 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved the Viking Therapeutics, Inc. 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2024 Plan”), which replaces the 2014 Plan. No further awards have been or will be made under the 2014 Plan since May 21, 2024. The number of shares of common stock initially authorized for issuance pursuant to the 2024 Plan is equal to (a) 
12,000,000
 shares of common stock, plus (b) up to a maximum of 
7,674,614
 shares 
of common stock subject to outstanding stock options or other equity awards previously granted under the 2014 Plan that will become available for future issuance under the 2024 Plan to the extent that, after May 21, 2024, any such equity award terminates or expires prior to exercise or settlement, is not issued because the award is settled

2014 
ESPP. 
Initially, a total of 
458,331
 shares of the Company’s common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2014 ESPP. The 2014 ESPP provided that the number of shares available for issuance under the 2014 ESPP would, unless otherwise determined by the Company’s Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, be automatically increased on January 1 of each year commencing on January 1, 2016 and ended on (and including) January 1, 2024, in an amount equal to 
1
% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year. The shares of common stock available for purchase pursuant to the 2014 ESPP were authorized but unissued shares of the Company’s common stock, shares of the Company’s common stock that the Company otherwise held in treasury or shares of the Company’s common stock that were purchased on the open market in arms’ length transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. Shares of the Company’s common stock were offered for purchase under the 2014 ESPP as determined by the Compensation Committee through a series of successive offerings that each had a term of 
24
 months and consisted of 
four
 consecutive purchase periods of 
six months
 each. As of December 31, 2023, there were 
4,251,444
 shares of the Company’s common stock available for issuance and, effective January 1, 2024, an additional 
1,001,137
 shares of the Company’s common stock were added to the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2014 ESPP in accordance with the terms of the 2014 ESPP. On May 20, 2024, 
166,816
 shares of the Company’s common stock were purchased by participants of the 2014 ESPP.

2024 ESPP. 
On May 21, 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved the Viking Therapeutics, Inc. 2024 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2024 ESPP”), which replaced the 2014 ESPP. No further shares have been, or will be, issued to participants under the 2014 ESPP since May 21, 2024. The maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock that may be issued under the 2024 ESPP will not exceed 
5,500,000
 shares for issuance pursuant to purchases under the 2024 ESPP. The shares of common stock available for purchase pursuant to the 2024 ESPP are authorized but unissued shares of the Company’s common stock, shares of the Company’s common stock that the Company otherwise held in treasury or shares of the Company’s common stock that are purchased on the open market in arms’ length transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. Shares of the Company’s common stock will be offered for purchase under the 2024 ESPP as determined by the Compensation Committee through a series of successive offerings that each have a term of 
24
 months and consist of 
four
 consecutive purchase periods of 
six months
 each. Prior to the commencement of any future offering under the 2024 ESPP, the Compensation Committee may determine that the current offering shall end, may commence a new offering on the first day after the end of such terminal purchase period (or any desired later date), and may decide that future offerings will consist of one or more consecutive purchase periods, each to be of such duration as determined by the Compensation Committee; however, no offering will exceed 
27
 months and no purchase period will exceed 
one year
. Each employee of the Company who (1) is an employee on the first date of any offering under the 2024 ESPP, (2) is customarily scheduled to work for more than 20 hours per week and more than five months per calendar year, and (3) meets such other criteria as may be determined by the Compensation Committee (consistent with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)), is eligible to participate in the 2024 ESPP for each purchase period within such offering. The purchase price per share of the Company’s common stock under the 2024 ESPP may not be less than, and will initially be equal to, the lesser of: (1) 
85
% of the fair market value per share of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the offering, or (2) 
85
% of the fair market value per share of the Company’s common stock on the date the purchase right is exercised, which will be the last day of the applicable purchase period.

The Company issues performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSU awards”). These awards are issued to certain of its employees and the shares subject to these PRSU awards will vest upon the Company achieving certain milestones over a four-year period, with any

F-
20

then-unvested portion of the PRSU awards to be cancelled on the four-year anniversary of the applicable grant date. At the grant date, the Company determines the grant date fair value, as a publicly traded company, using the intrinsic value, or the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. At the point where the criteria are deemed probable of being met, the Company records stock-based compensation with a cumulative catch-up expense in the period first recognized and then on a straight-line basis over the remaining period for which the performance criteria are expected to be completed.
In January 2020, the Company issued 
244,000
 PRSU awards to several of its employees, which are reflected in the above table summarizing restricted stock unit activity. The shares subject to these PRSU awards shall vest upon the Company achieving certain milestones, with 
100
% of the shares subject to the PRSU awards vesting upon the achievement of 
three
 of the milestones over a 
four-year
 period, with any then-unvested portion of the PRSU awards to be cancelled on the four-year anniversary of the grant dates. As of December 31, 2024, 
10,500
 PRSU awards were forfeited, 
two
 of the three milestones had been met and the remaining 
one
 was deemed improbable of achievement, resulting in the Company recording cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $
1.2
 million through December 31, 2024 and stock-based compensation expense of $(

) during the year ended December 31, 2024.

In January 2021, the Company issued 
205,500
 PRSU awards to several of its employees, which are reflected in the above table summarizing restricted stock unit activity. The shares subject to these PRSU awards shall vest upon the Company achieving certain milestones, with

Compensation expense for stock options granted to employees is based on the estimated grant date fair value and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable option. The estimated per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted to employees during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was

As stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on options ultimately expected to vest, 
the fair value of each employee option grant during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

 The expected volatility rate used to value stock option grants is based on the volatility of the Company’s historical share prices.

Expected Term
. The Company elected to utilize the “simplified” method for “plain vanilla” options to value stock option grants. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected life is presumed to be the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option.
Risk-free Interest Rate
. The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury instruments that had terms consistent with the expected term of the Company’s stock option grants.
Expected Dividend Yield
. The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and does not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Forfeitures are accounted for as actual forfeitures occur.
Since the Company had a net operating loss carryforward as of December 31, 2024, 
no
 excess tax benefits for the tax deductions related to stock-based awards were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Common Stock Reserved for Future Issuance
Common stock reserved for future issuance as of December 31, 2024 is as follows:

Warrants
On June 14, 2017, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement, with certain accredited investors (the “Purchasers”), pursuant to which the Company sold an aggregate of 
3,749,783
 shares (the “Shares”) of its common stock, and the warrants to purchase up to an aggregate 
2,812,337
 shares of its common stock to the Purchasers (the “Warrants”). The combined purchase price for one Share and one Warrant to purchase 
0.75
 shares of common stock was $
1.15
. The closing of the issuance of the Shares and the Warrants occurred on June 19, 2017. The Warrants had an exercise price of $
1.30
 per share, subject to adjustment as provided therein, and became exercisable beginning on 
December 19, 2017
 through 
December 19, 2022
. The Warrants were exercised in full as of December 31, 2022.

A valuation allowance o
f $
164.1
 million and 
$
119.0

million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, has been recorded to offset net deferred tax assets, as the Company is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had approxim
ately $
157.8
 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards, of which $
17.8
 million will begin to expire in 
2032
 and the remaining $
140.0
 million of which can be carried forward indefinitely.  The Company has $
109.6
 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that will begin to expire in 
2034
.
The Company's ability to utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards may be limited under Section 382 of the Code.  
Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of an "ownership change," which is defined by Section 382 of the Code as a cumulative change in ownership of the Company of more than 
50
% within a three-year period.  If the Company undergoes one or more ownership changes in connection with any future transactions in its stock, the Company's ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to offset federal taxable income, if any, could potentially result in increased future tax liability to the Company. An ownership change under Section 382 of the Code occurred during the year ended December 31, 2018.
 However, as of December 31, 2024, there is 
no
 limitation on the federal and state net operating losses.
The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various state jurisdictions. The Company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service and various state agencies for the years ended December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2024.

F-
24

At December 31, 2024, the Company has federal and state research and development tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $
19.0
 million and $
8.2
 million, respectively.  The federal credits begin to expire in 
2036
.  The state credits do not expire.
The differences between the Company's effective income tax rate and the statutory federal rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023 relate primarily to losses incurred for which 
no
 tax benefit was recognized, due to uncertainty of realization.  The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible.  The Company considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. At each of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company provided a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of those assets as a result of historical taxable net losses.
The Company has reviewed its operations and has not identified any material uncertain tax positions.  As a result, there is 
no
 liability for uncertain tax positions in the income tax provision as of December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

Commitments and Contingencies
On May 25, 2018, the Company entered into an Office Lease (the “Lease”) with Kilroy Realty, L.P. The Lease was for approximately 
7,149
 rentable square feet of space located at 12340 El Camino Real, Suite 250, San Diego, California 92130 (the “2018 Premises”). The 2018 Premises was the Company’s corporate headquarters.
The Lease commenced on 
November 1, 2018

27,000
, subject to annual increases of 
3.0
% during the Lease term. Under the Lease, the Company was responsible for certain charges for common area maintenance and other costs, including electricity and utility expenses and the Lease provided for abatement of rent during certain periods and escalating rent payments throughout the Lease term. Rent expense was recorded on a straight-line basis over the life of the Lease and the difference between the rent expense and rent paid was recorded as deferred rent.
On November 15, 2021, the Company entered into an Office Lease (the “Office Lease”) with One Pacific Heights. LLC. The Office Lease is for approximately 
7,940
 rentable square feet of space located at 9920 Pacific Heights Blvd, Suite 350, San Diego, California 92121 (the “Premises”). The Premises are now the Company’s corporate headquarters.
Monthly base rent payments due under the Office Lease for the Premises are $
28,187
, subject to annual increases of 
3.0
% during the Term. Under the Office Lease, the Company is responsible for certain charges for common area maintenance and other costs, including utility expenses and the Office Lease provides for abatement of rent during certain periods and escalating rent payments throughout the Term.
The Office Lease provides the Company with an option to extend the term of the Office Lease for a period of 
five years
 beyond the Term. If the option is exercised, the renewal term will be upon the same terms and conditions as the original Term, except that the base rent will be equal to the prevailing market rate as determined pursuant to the terms of the Office Lease.
