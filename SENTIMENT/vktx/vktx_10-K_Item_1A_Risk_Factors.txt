Overview

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel, first-in-class or best-in-class therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders.

In January 2022, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 single ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple ascending dose, or MAD, clinical trial of VK2735, a novel dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, or GIP, receptors. VK2375 is being developed in both oral and subcutaneous formulations for the potential treatment of various metabolic disorders such as obesity.

On March 28, 2023, we announced the completion of the Phase 1 trial. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, SAD and MAD study in healthy adults. The primary objectives of the study included evaluation of the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of VK2735 delivered subcutaneously and the identification of VK2735 doses suitable for further clinical development. Study investigators also evaluated the pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of VK2735. Based upon the results from this Phase 1 study, in September 2023, we initiated the VENTURE study, a Phase 2 clinical trial of VK2735 in patients with obesity.

The Phase 2 VENTURE study was a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and weight loss efficacy of VK2735, administered subcutaneously, once weekly. The 13-week study enrolled adults who were obese (BMI >= 30 kg/m2) or adults who were overweight (BMI >= 27kg/m2) with at least one weight-related co-morbidity condition. The primary endpoint of the study was the percent change in body weight from baseline to week 13, with secondary and exploratory endpoints evaluating a range of additional safety and efficacy measures. In October 2023, we announced completion of patient enrollment in the Phase 2 VENTURE study and on February 27, 2024, we announced that patients receiving weekly doses of VK2735 demonstrated statistically significant reductions in mean body weight after 13 weeks, ranging up to 14.7% from baseline. Patients receiving VK2735 also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in mean body weight relative to placebo, ranging up to 13.1%. Based on written feedback received from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, we expect to initiate Phase 3 clinical studies of the subcutaneous formulation of VK2735 in the first half of 2025.

On March 28, 2023, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate a novel oral formulation of VK2735. The study, which was an extension of our recently completed Phase 1 evaluation of subcutaneously administered VK2735, evaluated daily oral doses for 28 days. On March 26, 2024, we announced that the 28-day MAD study results highlighted positive signs of clinical activity following treatment with oral VK2735. Cohorts receiving VK2735 demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in mean body weight from baseline, ranging up to approximately 5.3%.

On January 8, 2025, we announced the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of the oral tablet formulation of VK2735, our dual agonist of the GLP-1 and GIP receptors. We expect to complete this study and report initial results in the second half of 2025.

We are also developing VK2809, which is an orally available, tissue and receptor-subtype selective agonist of the thyroid hormone receptor beta, or TRß. In November 2019, we initiated the VOYAGE study, a Phase 2b clinical trial of VK2809 in patients with biopsy-confirmed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH/MASH.

The VOYAGE study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of VK2809 in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH/MASH and fibrosis ranging from stages F1 to F3. The primary endpoint of the study evaluated the relative change in liver fat content, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, proton density fat

fraction, or MRI-PDFF, from baseline to week 12 in subjects treated with VK2809 as compared to placebo. Secondary objectives included evaluation of histologic changes assessed by hepatic biopsy after 52 weeks of dosing.

In January 2023, we announced completion of patient enrollment in the VOYAGE study and in May 2023 we reported that the VOYAGE study successfully achieved its primary endpoint, with patients receiving VK2809 experiencing statistically significant reductions in liver fat content from baseline to Week 12 as compared to placebo.

In June 2024, we announced positive 52-week histologic data from the VOYAGE study with up to 75% of patients treated with VK2809 achieving NASH/MASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis as compared to 29% for placebo (p=0.0001), up to 57% of VK2809-treated patients achieving ≥1-stage improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of NASH/MASH as compared to 34% for placebo (p<0.05) and up to 48% of VK2809-treated patients achieving both resolution of NASH/MASH and a ≥1-stage improvement in fibrosis as compared to 20% for placebo (p=0.01). Adverse events, including GI-related adverse events were similar among VK2809-treated patients vs. placebo at week 52 and consistent with prior data reported at week 12. VK2809 has been evaluated in eight completed clinical studies, which enrolled more than 400 subjects.

We are also developing VK0214, which is also an orally available, tissue and receptor-subtype selective agonist of TRß for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, or X-ALD, a rare X-linked, inherited neurological disorder characterized by a breakdown in the protective barriers surrounding brain and nerve cells. The disease, for which there is no approved treatment, is caused by mutations in a peroxisomal transporter of very long chain fatty acids, or VLCFA, known as ABCD1. As a result, transporter function is impaired and patients are unable to efficiently metabolize VLCFA. The TRß receptor is known to regulate expression of an alternative VLCFA transporter, known as ABCD2. Various preclinical models have demonstrated that increased expression of ABCD2 can lead to normalization of VLCFA metabolism. Preliminary data suggest that VK0214 stimulates ABCD2 expression in an in vitro model and reduces VLCFA levels in an in vivo model of X-ALD.

In June 2021, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial of VK0214 in patients with X-ALD. This trial was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adult male patients with the adrenomyeloneuropathy, or AMN, form of X-ALD. The study enrolled patients across three cohorts: placebo, VK0214 20 mg daily, and VK0214 40 mg daily.

The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VK0214 administered once-daily over a 28-day dosing period. Secondary objectives included an evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of VK0214 following 28 days of dosing in this population. An exploratory objective was to evaluate the effects of VK0214 on plasma levels of very long-chain fatty acids, or VLCFAs, in subjects with AMN. In October 2024, we announced results from the Phase 1b clinical trial, which showed VK0214 to be safe and well-tolerated following once-daily dosing over the 28-day study period. In addition, significant reductions were observed in plasma levels of VLCFAs and other lipids, as compared to

placebo. Our intent is to pursue partnering or licensing opportunities for VK0214 prior to conducting additional clinical studies.

Other clinical programs include VK5211, an orally available, non-steroidal selective androgen receptor modulator, or SARM. In November 2017, we announced positive top-line results from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in 108 patients recovering from non-elective hip fracture surgery. Top-line data showed that the trial achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating statistically significant, dose dependent increases in lean body mass, less head, following treatment with VK5211 as compared to placebo. The study also achieved certain secondary endpoints, demonstrating statistically significant increases in appendicular lean body mass and total lean body mass for all doses of VK5211, compared to placebo. VK5211 demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability in this study, with no drug-related SAEs reported. Our intent is to continue to pursue partnering or licensing opportunities for VK5211 prior to conducting additional clinical studies.

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 24, 2012. Since our incorporation, we have devoted most of our efforts towards conducting certain clinical trials and preclinical studies related to our VK2735 subcutaneous, VK2735 oral, VK2809, VK0214, VK5211 and dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist programs and towards raising capital and building infrastructure.
