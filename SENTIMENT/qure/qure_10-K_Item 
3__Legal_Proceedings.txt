​
Overview
​
We are a leader in the field of gene therapy, seeking to deliver to patients suffering from rare and other devastating diseases single treatments with potentially curative results. We are advancing a focused pipeline of innovative gene therapies, including our clinical candidates for the treatment of Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis caused by mutations in superoxide dismutase 1, refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (“mTLE”), and Fabry disease.
​
Huntington’s disease program (AMT-130)
​
AMT-130 is our novel gene therapy candidate for the treatment of Huntington’s disease, which utilizes our proprietary, gene-silencing miQURE platform and incorporates an AAV vector carrying a 
micro ribonucleic acid
 (“miRNA”) specifically designed to silence the huntingtin gene and the potentially highly toxic exon 1 protein fragment.
We are currently conducting the U.S. and European studies. We completed the enrollment of all 26 patients in the first two cohorts of our US study in March 2022 and the enrollment of 13 patients in the two cohorts of our European study in June 2023. As of February 2025, we have enrolled 12 patients into a third cohort to further investigate both doses of AMT-130 together with perioperative immunosuppression using the current, established stereotactic administration procedure. 
RMAT Designation
In June 2024, we announced that the FDA granted us RMAT designation for AMT-130. 
Updated Interim Data
In July 2024, we announced updated interim clinical data, including up to 24 months of follow-up data from 29 patients enrolled in the U.S. study and the European study as of a March 31, 2024 cut-off date. 
Regulatory Alignment 
In December 2024, following our initial Type B meeting, we announced that we had reached agreement with FDA on key elements of an accelerated approval pathway for AMT-130.
​

​

Table of Contents
Other clinical candidates
In November 2024, we announced that the that the first patient was dosed in the GenTLE Phase I/IIa clinical trial of AMT-260 for the treatment of refractory mTLE. In addition, the FDA recently approved a protocol amendment expanding the inclusion criteria for certain patients in the first cohort to include patients with non-lesional mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in the non-dominant hemisphere.  
​
In August 2024, we announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial of AMT-191 for the treatment of Fabry disease. In February 2025, we announced that we completed the enrollment of the first cohort of the clinical trial and that we would proceed enrolling the second cohort of the clinical trial.
​
In October 2024, we announced the first patient was dosed in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial of AMT-162 for the treatment of SOD1-ALS.

In January 2025, we announced that we completed the enrollment of the first cohort of the clinical trial and that we would proceed enrolling the second cohort of the clinical trial.
​
Sale of commercial manufacturing activities
​
In June 2024, we and Genezen entered into the Lexington Transaction, which closed in July 2024. Genezen acquired manufacturing facility including equipment and related manufacturing operations with a carrying value of $15.2 million, inventory with a carrying value of $8.8 million and certain other assets (including allocated goodwill) with a carrying value of $2.8 million associated with the Lexington Facility on Closing.
​
As consideration for the Lexington Transaction, we received from Genezen (i) shares of newly issued Series C preferred stock of Genezen Holdings Inc. valued at $12.5 million, which are convertible into common stock and will accrue an 8.0% per annum cumulative dividend, (ii) a convertible promissory note with a nominal amount of $12.5 million, bearing interest at 8.0% per annum and maturing 63 months following the date of issuance valued at $13.3 million and (iii) a right to purchase HEMGENIX® at terms considered favorable to market terms (the “Consideration”) valued at $16.7 million. We also included a firm purchase commitment liability, valued at $8.8 million for our customer contract with CSL Behring inherently related to the right to purchase HEMGENIX® in the consideration received.
​
We recorded a $1.2 million gain from the divestment. We paid a total of $8.3 million to Genezen and CSL Behring related to adjustments of working capital and to obtain consent to proceed with the divestiture. 
​
In connection with the Closing, we, Genezen and the landlord of the Lexington Facility entered into an agreement for us to assign and Genezen to assume the existing lease agreement between us and the landlord. We also amended our original July 2013 guarantee to continue guaranteeing rental payments owed by Genezen until the end of the current term on May 31, 2029. In the event of Genezen’s default related to rental payments owed to the landlord, we are entitled to terminate the assignment agreement and step into the original lease agreement.
​
At the Closing, we entered into a commercial supply agreement (“CSA”) with Genezen. Pursuant to the CSA, Genezen manufactures and supplies CSL Behring’s commercial demand for HEMGENIX® on our behalf. The CSA includes a minimum term of three years and minimum purchase commitments of HEMGENIX® commercial supplies of $43.3 million over the first three years, unless certain contractual provisions are triggered. Our obligations with respect to the supply of HEMGENIX® to CSL Behring remain in effect notwithstanding the subcontracting to Genezen.
​
Organizational restructuring
​
In August 2024, we announced the Restructuring to conserve capital and streamline the organization. As a result of the Restructuring and Lexington Transaction, we eliminated approximately 300 positions or 65% of our workforce. 
​
We substantially completed the Restructuring at the end of 2024. We have incurred $5.2 million of employee severance costs in the year ended December 31, 2024 and estimate that we will incur additional costs in the range of $0.5 million to $1.0 million in 2025.

Financing
Royalty financing agreement
In May 2023, we entered into a royalty purchase agreement (the “Royalty Financing Agreement”) with HemB SPV, L.P. (the “Purchaser”). Under the terms of the Royalty Financing Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $375.0 million in exchange for the Purchaser’s rights to the lowest royalty tier on CSL Behring’s worldwide net sales of HEMGENIX® for certain current and future royalties due to us. We will be obligated to pay $25.0 million of the first worldwide sales milestone payment from CSL Behring, if received, to the Purchaser. The Purchaser will receive 1.85 times the upfront payment (or $693.8 million) until June 30, 2032 (“First Hard Cap Date”) if such thresholds are met or, if such cap is not met by June 30, 2032, up to 2.25 times of the upfront payment through December 31, 2038 (“Second Hard Cap Date”). If, on or prior to the defined dates for each cap amount, the total amount of royalty payments received by the Purchaser equals or exceeds the cap amount applicable to such date, the Royalty Financing Agreement will automatically terminate and all rights to the HEMGENIX® royalty payments will revert back to us. We have no obligation to repay any amounts received from the Purchaser in the event that the applicable cap amount is not reached during the term of the Royalty Financing Agreement.  
As of December 31, 2024 we expect to satisfy our commitment to the Purchaser prior to the Second Hard Cap Date. Until December 2024, we assumed that we would satisfy the commitments to the Purchaser prior to the First Hard Cap Date. 
We retained the rights to all other royalties, as well as contractual milestones totaling up to $1.3 billion, under the terms of the CSL Behring Agreement.
Hercules loan repayment and amendment
Upon entering into the Royalty Financing Agreement in May 2023, we and Hercules amended our existing term loan facility. Through the May 2023 amendment we extended the maturity date and interest-only period from December 1, 2025 to January 5, 2027 (the “Maturity Date”). 
​
In connection with the Closing we once more amended the facility. As a condition to Hercules’ consent to the Lexington Transaction we prepaid $50.0 million of the total $100.0 million principal outstanding in July 2024. The remaining $50.0 million principal outstanding will need to be repaid at the Maturity Date.
​
Financing
In January 2025, we raised $70.1 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, through a follow-on public offering of 4.4 million ordinary shares at a price to the public of $17.00 per ordinary share. In February 2025, we raised an additional $10.6 million in net proceeds upon the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase an additional 0.7 million ordinary shares at the public offering price.

As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,130.0 million (December 31, 2023: $890.4 million). 
See “Results of Operations” below for a discussion of the detailed components and analysis of the amounts above.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
​
In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net loss/income and affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our assumptions, estimates and judgments, including those related to what we believe to be our critical accounting policies. Refer to Note 2 
“Summary of significant accounting policies”
 for a summary of our significant accounting policies. 
We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not clear from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
​
We consider the following to be our critical accounting estimates in the year ended December 31, 2024:
​
●
Contingent consideration recorded in relation to the uniQure France SAS business combination;
●
Valuation of the intangible asset with favorable terms recorded as part of the Lexington Transaction;
●
Date at which we expect to satisfy the commitment under the Royalty Financing Agreement.
​
Contingent consideration
In July 2021 (“Acquisition Date”), we acquired uniQure France SAS (“Acquisition Date”) and we recorded contingent consideration related to amounts potentially payable to uniQure France SAS’s former shareholders. The amounts payable in accordance with the share and purchase agreement (“SPA”) are contingent upon realization of certain milestones associated with AMT-260. Contingent consideration was measured at fair value at the Acquisition Date with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in research and development expenses.
Changes in contingent consideration can result from changes in the assumed achievement and timing of estimated milestones and the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the liability:
●
We had used discount rates ranging from 15.3% to 15.6% to calculate the contingent consideration as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024 we used discount rates ranging from 15.3% to 16.2% to reflect increases in market interest rates. An increase in the discount rate reduces the fair value of the contingent consideration liability whereas a decrease in the discount rate increases the fair market value of the contingent consideration liability.
90
​

Table of Contents
●
We need to regularly update our estimate of when a milestone is expected to be achieved. An achievement of a milestone at a later than currently expected date reduces the fair value of the contingent consideration liability whereas an achievement at an earlier than currently expected date increases the fair value of the contingent consideration liability.
●
We initially recorded the contingent consideration liability on the Acquisition Date assuming a 40% probability of advancing the TLE research program into clinical development. We developed this estimate using data from an external study regarding the average likelihood of advancing into clinical development at a certain stage or preclinical development. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had increased the probability to 66.0% following the commencement of toxicology studies for the TLE program. During the year ended December 31, 2023 we increased the probability to 100.0% following the clearance of the IND application for AMT-260 in August 2023. We did not change the probabilities of any further milestones following the dosing of the first patient in a Phase I/II clinical trial in November 2024. The increase in probabilities resulted in a $14.2 million expense in the year ended December 31, 2023 and a $4.4 million expense in the year ended December 31, 2022. This also resulted in an increase of the probability that AMT-260 may advance to late-stage development and commercialization.
The fair value of the contingent consideration liability as of December 31, 2024 was EUR 10.5 million ($10.9 million) and as of December 31, 2023 was EUR 39.0 million ($43.0 million). The reduction was primarily driven by a EUR 26.8 million ($28.2 million) milestone payment we made in December 2024 related to the first patient dosed in the AMT-260 clinical trial. If as of December 31, 2024, we had assumed a 100% likelihood of AMT-260 advancing into a Phase III clinical study, then the fair value of the contingent consideration would have increased to EUR 33.7 million ($35.0 million). If as of December 31, 2024 the Company had assumed that it would discontinue development of the AMT-260 program, then the contingent consideration would have been released to income.
Intangible asset
Part of the consideration received in the Lexington Transaction included a right, with an estimated fair market value of $16.7 million, to purchase HEMGENIX® from Genezen up to the termination of our supply agreement with CSL Behring at terms considered favorable to market terms. The determination of the fair value required us to estimate the current and future commercial supply prices of HEMGENIX® to compare these to the contractually agreed terms at Closing. Prices for the commercial supply of HEMGENIX® are not readily observable in the market. Therefore, our estimate of the commercial supply price was based on what a market participant would be willing to pay in a comparable transaction, using industry benchmarks, relevant market data, current and historical commercial supply agreements, as well as historical production cost information as reference points.
If the estimated commercial supply price used in the valuation had increased by 5% per drug product batch, then the fair market value of the intangible asset and the consideration received as well as the gain recorded on the divestment would have been increased by $3.0 million. If the estimated commercial supply price used in the valuation had been decreased by 5% per drug product batch, then the fair market value of the intangible asset and the consideration received on the divestment would have been decreased by $2.9 million. This would have resulted in a loss on divestment of $1.7 million instead of the $1.2 million gain presented.
​
Date at which we expect to satisfy the commitment under the Royalty Financing Agreement
​
On May 12, 2023, we entered into the Royalty Financing Agreement with the Purchaser. Under the terms of the Royalty Financing Agreement we received an upfront payment of $375.0 million in exchange for its rights to the lowest royalty tier on CSL Behring’s worldwide net sales of HEMGENIX® for certain current and future royalties due to us (refer to Note 13 “Royalty Financing Agreement” for further details). Pursuant to the agreement, the total amount of royalties to be received by the Purchaser is subject to an increasing cap equal to (i) $693.8 million up to the First Hard Cap Date if such thresholds are met or, if such cap is not met by the First Hard Cap Date (ii) $843.8 million through the Second Hard Cap Date. If, on or prior to the defined dates for each cap amount, the total amount of royalty payments received by the Purchaser equals or exceeds the cap amount applicable to such date, the Royalty Financing Agreement will automatically terminate and all rights to the HEMGENIX® royalty payments will revert back to us. We have no obligation to repay any amounts received from the Purchaser in the event that the applicable cap amount is not reached during the term of the Royalty Financing Agreement. 
​

​

Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2024, we expect to satisfy our commitment to the Purchaser prior to the Second Hard Cap Date. Until December 2024, we assumed that we would satisfy the commitments to the Purchaser prior to the First Hard Cap Date. As a result of this change in estimate we expect that our total payments of interest expense will increase from $318.8 million by $150.0 million to $468.8 million over a term that was extended from 9 years to 15.5 years.
​
Revenue recognition related to CSL Behring variable milestone payments
​
We sold the exclusive global rights HEMGENIX™ to CSL Behring in 2021. The consideration received included variable milestone payments which we recorded as revenue once probable. We recorded $100.0 million of variable milestone revenue related to a first sale of HEMGENIX™ as license revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022 following the November 2022 BLA approval. We collected the payment in July 2023. We do not consider this to be a critical accounting estimate for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 because we currently do not expect to recognize any regulatory milestone payments within the next 12 months.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
​
In the year ended December 31, 2024, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-07”). This update requires us to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). In addition, ASU 2023-07 requires us to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations but resulted in expanded disclosures in the segment reporting section of the financial statements. We adopted ASU 2023-07 using a retrospective transition method.

CSL Behring
We sold the exclusive global rights to HEMGENIX® to CSL Behring in 2021 (“License Sale”). We recognize license revenue in relation to the License Sale when it becomes probable that regulatory and sales milestone events will be achieved as well as when royalties on sales of HEMGENIX® have been earned. We recognized $10.1 million, $2.8 million and $100.0 million of license revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We recognized $10.1 million and $2.8 million of license revenue in 2024 and 2023 related to royalty payments owed on 
HEMGENIX® sales, when earned.
 We recognized $100.0 million of license revenue in 2022 related to a milestone payment owed on the first sale of HEMGENIX
®
 in the U.S. in 2023. 
In 2008, we entered into a license agreement with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (“St. Jude”), which we amended in 2012. Under this license agreement, St. Jude has granted us an exclusive license, with a right to sublicense, to patent rights relating to expression of hFIX in gene therapy vectors, to make, import, distribute, use, and commercialize products containing hFIX covered by a valid patent claim in the field of gene therapy for treatment or prophylaxis of hemophilia B. The majority of the U.S. patent rights will expire in 2028 and the European patent rights (along with one U.S. patent) will expire in 2025. 
With respect to our collaboration with CSL Behring, we have agreed with St. Jude on an apportionment of certain amounts we receive from CSL Behring as sublicensing revenue that is equivalent to a low-single digit percentage of such amounts. The agreement will remain in effect until no further payment is due relating to any licensed product under this agreement or either we or St. Jude exercise our rights to terminate it. St. Jude may terminate the agreement in specified circumstances relating to our insolvency. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time subject to a specified notice period.
We treat license payments to St. Jude as contract fulfillment costs associated with license revenue we receive from CSL Behring and recognize these as costs of license revenues. We incurred $1.3 million, $0.1 million and $1.3 million of such cost in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
We recognize collaboration revenues associated with services we provide to CSL Behring. Collaboration revenue is recognized when the performance obligations are satisfied. We recognized $10.9 million, $2.3 million and $3.0 million of collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in collaboration revenue in 2024 of $8.6 million compared to 2023 was primarily related to additional development and other services provided in relation to the transfer of manufacturing responsibility to CSL Behring. The decrease in collaboration revenue in 2023 of $0.7 million compared to 2022 was primarily related to a reduction in services requested by CSL Behring following the submissions of the BLA and MAA for HEMGENIX
® in 2022.

We provided contract manufacturing service to CSL Behring between April 2022 and July 2024. We transferred these activities to Genezen as part of the Lexington Transaction. 
Following the Closing of the Lexington Transaction, title to HEMGENIX® supply directly passes from the contract manufacturer, Genezen, to CSL Behring. We do not control HEMGENIX® before it is transferred to CSL Behring. We arrange for HEMGENIX® to be provided by Genezen to CSL Behring. We determined that we are an agent in the sale of HEMGENIX® to CSL Behring.  
As a result of being an agent, we recognize corresponding costs related to the purchase of HEMGENIX® from Genezen net of income from the sales of HEMGENIX® to CSL Behring and income related to the release of liabilities associated with expected net losses in Other expense within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
We recognized contract manufacturing revenues related to contract manufacturing HEMGENIX
®

for CSL Behring when earned upon sales of HEMGENIX
®

to CSL Behring. We recognized $6.1 million, $10.8 million and $1.7 million contract manufacturing revenues in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
We incurred $17.1 million of cost of contract manufacturing revenues related to the manufacture of 
HEMGENIX®
 in the year ended December 31, 2024 and $13.6 million and $2.1 million of cost of contract manufacturing revenues, in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively. Costs of contract manufacturing revenues increased in
 the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023
 primarily due to expensing costs that could not be recovered from selling HEMGENIX
®
 under the terms of our development and commercial supply agreement with CSL Behring. Costs of contract manufacturing revenues increased in
 the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022
 due to the increase in sales of 
HEMGENIX® and a write-down of inventory that had a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value.
BMS
Following the termination of the collaboration, research and license agreements and the amended agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb (“BMS”) in February 2023, we did not recognize any further revenue for services rendered. We recognized nil collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Res
e
arch and development expenses

●
employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation expense;
●
costs incurred for laboratory research, preclinical and nonclinical studies, clinical trials, statistical analysis and report writing, and regulatory compliance costs incurred with clinical research organizations and other third-party vendors;
●
costs incurred to conduct consistency and comparability studies;
●
costs incurred for the development and improvement of our manufacturing processes and methods;
●
costs associated with research activities for enabling technology platforms;
●
costs associated with the rendering of collaboration services;
●
payments related to identifiable intangible assets without an alternative future use;
●
payments to our licensors for milestones that have been achieved related to our product candidates;

Our research and development expenses primarily consist of costs incurred for the research and development of our product candidates, which include:
​
●
AMT-130 (Huntington’s disease).
 We have been incurring costs related to our U.S. study since February 2019. Since 2021, we have also incurred costs related to our European study;
●
AMT-260 
(Temporal lobe epilepsy)
. We have incurred costs related to the development of AMT-260. We acquired this program in July 2021;
●
AMT-191 
(Fabry disease)
. We have incurred costs related to the development of AMT-191 for the treatment of Fabry disease;
●
AMT-162 (
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis caused by mutations in SOD1
) We have incurred costs related to the acquisition in addition to costs incurred to initiate and conduct a Phase I/II clinical trial; 
●
AMT-061 (Hemophilia B)
. We transitioned activities related to the clinical trial and long-term follow-up of patients to CSL Behring in December 2022. Direct research and development expenses related to clinical development and other regulatory activities and commercialization expenses incurred in the periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2024 are presented net of reimbursements due from CSL Behring and include settlement amounts from the transition. 
●
Preclinical research programs
. We incurred costs related to the research of multiple preclinical gene therapy product candidates with the potential to treat certain rare and other serious medical conditions; and 
●
Technology platform development and other related research
. We incurred significant research and development costs related to manufacturing prior to the Closing of the Lexington Transaction and other enabling technologies that are applicable across all our programs.
Our R&D expenses may vary substantially from period to period based on the timing of our research and development activities, including regulatory submissions, and enrollment of patients in clinical trials. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. Estimating the nature, timing, or cost of the development of any of our product candidates involves considerable judgement due to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing gene therapies, including the uncertainty of:
●
the scope, rate of progress and expense of our research and development activities;
●
clinical trial protocols, speed of enrollment and resulting data;
●
the effectiveness and safety of our product candidates; and
●
the timing of regulatory approvals. 
A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to our product candidates that we may develop could mean a significant change in the expenses and timing associated with the development of such product candidate.

Huntington disease (AMT-130)
​
In the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we incurred $18.0 million, $13.0 million and $19.8 million expenses respectively. Our external costs for the development of AMT-130 were primarily related to the execution of our U.S. and European studies. The increase of $5.0 million in external cost in 2024 compared to 2023 is a result of enrolling patients into a third cohort between November 2023 and December 2024 as well as expenses we incurred associated with the RMAT application and in preparation of the Type B meeting with the FDA in November 2024. The decrease of $6.8 million in external cost in 2023 compared to 2022 is a result of the completion of U.S. patient enrollment in March 2022. 
​
Temporal lobe epilepsy (AMT-260)
In the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 we incurred $12.1 million, $13.0 million and $16.2 million expenses respectively. In August 2023, the FDA cleared our IND application, and we started incurring costs for the preparation of a Phase I clinical trial. 
​
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis caused by mutations in SOD1 (AMT-162)
In January 2023, we entered into a global licensing agreement with Apic Bio for AMT-162. In the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we incurred $7.3 million and $6.0 million of expenses, respectively, to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial in which enrolled the first patient in October 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred expenses of $10.0 million related to the upfront consideration paid to Apic Bio for the global licensing rights to AMT-162.

Other research & development expenses
​
●
We incurred $49.8 million in employee and contractor expenses in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $74.6 million in 2023 and $64.9 million in 2022. Our cost decreased in 2024 by $24.7 million compared to 2023 primarily as a result of the July 2024 Lexington Transaction as well as the October 2023 and August 2024 reorganizations. The increase in 2023 of $9.6 million, compared to 2022, primarily related to the hiring of new personnel and contractors in 2022 through mid-2023 to support our clinical-stage programs and manufacturing operations;
●
We incurred $21.6 million in operating expenses and depreciation expenses related to our rented facilities in Amsterdam and Lexington, Massachusetts in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $29.4 million in 2023 and $23.6 million in 2022. The decrease in 2024 compared to 2023 of $7.9 million is primarily a result of the July 2024 Lexington Transaction. Our costs increased by $5.9 million in 2023 compared to 2022 as a result of incurring additional operating and depreciation expenses in both our Lexington and Amsterdam facilities;
●
We incurred $9.3 million in share-based compensation expenses in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $16.9 million in 2023 and $18.4 million in 2022. The decrease in 2024 of $7.6 million, compared to 2023, is primarily a result of the July 2024 Lexington Transaction, the reorganizations in October 2023 and August 2024 and a decrease in the fair value of the long-term incentive awards granted. The decrease in 2023 of $1.5 million, compared to 2022, is primarily due to the October 2023 reorganization and a decrease in the fair value of long-term incentive awards granted. This was partially offset by cost related to performance share units granted in 2021, for which achievement of related performance conditions was deemed probable in 2023 and 2024;
●
We incurred $5.1 million in disposables costs in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $13.2 million in 2023 and $17.8 million in 2022. The decrease in 2024 primarily related to the July 2024 Lexington Transaction as well as the reorganizations in October 2023 and August 2024. The decrease in 2023 compared to 2022 was related to the October 2023 reorganization;  
●
We incurred $4.0 million of severance costs in the year ended December 31, 2024 related to the July 2024 Lexington Transaction and the August 2024 reorganization, compared to $2.1 million of severance cost in 2023 related to the October 2023 reorganization. No such costs were incurred in 2022;
●
We incurred nil and $1.4 million of costs in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the impairment of the Lexington, MA facility right-of-use asset and related leasehold improvements, compared to nil in 2022; 
●
We recognized a $1.8 million gain in the year ended December 31, 2024 related to a decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of uniQure France SAS, compared to losses of $15.9 million in 2023 and $7.1 million in 2022. The increase in the 2023 loss was primarily due to an increase in the probability of making future milestone payments due upon dosing of the first patient in Phase I/II clinical trial of AMT-260 after receiving IND acceptance in August 2023; and

●
We incurred $9.7 million in other expenses in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $6.8 million in 2023 and $17.2 million in 2022. The increase in costs in 2024 of $2.9 million, compared to 2023, is primarily a result of an increase in information technology expenses partially offset by decreases in contractual license expenses and consultant-related expenses. The decrease in costs in 2023 of $10.4 million, compared to 2022, is due to decreases in contractual license expenses and consultant-related expenses.
​
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Our general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee, office, consulting, legal and other professional and administrative expenses. We incurred expenses associated with operating as a public company, including expenses for personnel, legal, accounting and audit fees, board of directors’ costs, directors' and officers' liability insurance premiums, Nasdaq listing fees, expenses related to investor relations and fees related to business development and maintaining our patent and license portfolio. Our selling costs included employee expenses as well as advisory fees related to obtaining the commercialization and license agreement (“CSL Behring Agreement”) between us and CSL Behring LLC (“CSL Behring”).
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $52.7 million, compared to $74.6 million and $55.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

We incurred $11.9 million of share-based compensation expenses in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $17.4 million in 2023 and $15.5 million in 2022. The decrease in 2024 of $5.5 million, compared to 2023, was primarily related to the Lexington Transaction, the October 2023 and August 2024 reorganizations, and a decrease in the fair value of long-term incentive awards granted, partially offset by an increase in long-term incentive awards granted and costs associated with performance share units, granted in December 2021, for which achievement of performance criteria was deemed probable in 2024. The increase in 2023 of $1.9 million, compared to 2022, was primarily related to an increase in long-term incentive awards granted and costs associated with performance share units, granted in December 2021, for which achievement of performance criteria was deemed probable in 2023. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in expense related to a reduction in the fair value of long-term incentive awards granted; 
●
We incurred $7.3 million in professional fees in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $11.7 million in 2023 and $7.1 million in 2022. We regularly incur accounting, audit and legal fees associated with operating as a public company. In 2024, we incurred additional professional fees related to the Lexington Transaction. In 2023, we incurred additional professional fees related to our global licensing agreement with Apic Bio, the Royalty Purchase Agreement and other corporate initiatives;

Our interest income increased in 2024 by $1.9 million compared to 2023 primarily due to the interest income earned on investment securities and cash on hand. Interest income increased by $19.0 million in 2023, compared to 2022, as a result of receiving $370.1 million of net proceeds from the May 2023 royalty financing agreement and a $100.0 million milestone payment from CSL Behring in July 2023.  
​

We recognized interest expense of $12.9 million in 2024, $14.6 million in 2023 and $11.7 million in 2022 related to the Hercules debt facility. Interest expense decreased by $1.7 million in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to the $50.0 million repayment of Hercules debt in July 2024, as well as a decrease in market interest rates. Interest expense increased by $2.9 million in 2023 compared to 2022 due to an increase in market interest rates related to the Hercules debt. 
We hold monetary items and enter into transactions in foreign currencies, predominantly in euros and U.S. dollars. We recognize foreign exchange results related to changes in these foreign currencies. In 2024, we recognized a net foreign currency loss of $10.5 million related to our borrowings from Hercules, the May 2023 royalty financing agreement and our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities as well as loans between entities within the uniQure group. We recognized a net loss of $1.7 million in 2023 and a net gain of $23.2 million in 2022.
In 2024 and 2023, we recognized no Other non-operating gains. In 2022, we recognized a $2.8 million net gain

​
Income tax
​
We recognized $2.3 million of deferred tax expense in 2024 compared to $1.9 million of deferred tax expense in 2023 and $1.5 million of deferred tax income in 2022. In 2024 and 2023 deferred tax expense recorded in the U.S., related to the consumption of net operating losses.
​
From 2022 up to mid-2023 we recognized deferred tax income in France as a result of the buildup of net operating losses by the French entity. The deferred tax income in France in 2024 is almost fully offset with an increase in valuation allowance.

Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and investment securities of $368.9 million. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial cash flows from successfully commercializing our proprietary product candidates, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution, and licensing arrangements. Based on our current operating plan, research and development plans and our timing expectations related to the progress of our programs, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities will fund our operations through the second half of 2027. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the timing of a potential BLA submission, approval and commercialization of AMT-130. We expect that we will require additional funding if we decide to advance any of our other clinical product candidates into late-stage clinical development. Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:
Debt
As of December 31, 2024, we had an outstanding loan amount owed to Hercules Capital, Inc. (“Hercules”) for an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million. In July 2024, in connection with the Closing of the Lexington Transaction, we repaid $50.0 million of the $100.0 million of principal outstanding as well as $3.1 million in end-of-term fees. Future interest payments and financing fees associated with the loan total $16.0 million, with $8.6 million payable within 12 months. We are contractually required to repay the $50.0 million principal outstanding in full in January 2027.
Leases
We entered into lease arrangements for facilities, including corporate, laboratory and office space. As of December 31, 2024, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $23.0 million, with $4.1 million payable within 12 months. Following the Closing of the Lexington Transaction, we assigned our lease for the Lexington facility to Genezen. This reduced our fixed lease payment obligations by $20.7 million. We continue to guarantee such payments until the end of the lease term in May 2029.
Commitments related to acquisition of uniQure France SAS (nominal amounts)
In relation to our acquisition of uniQure France SAS, we entered into commitments to make payments to the former shareholders upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The commitments include payments related to post-acquisition services that we agreed to as part of the transaction. In September 2023, we made a payment of EUR 10.0 million ($10.6 million) to the former shareholders of uniQure France SAS following the FDA’s clearance of the IND application for AMT-260. In December 2024, we made a payment of EUR 30.0 million ($31.5 million) to the former shareholders of uniQure France SAS following the dosing of the first patient in Phase I/II clinical trial for AMT-260. As of December 31, 2024, our remaining commitment amounts include a EUR 160.0 million ($166.2 million) in potential milestone payments associated with Phase III development and the approvals of AMT-260 in the U.S. and European Union. The timing of achieving these milestones and consequently the timing of payments, as well as whether the milestone will be achieved at all, is generally uncertain. These payments are owed in euro and have been translated at the foreign exchange rate as of December 31, 2024, of $1.04/€1.00. As of December 31, 2024, we expect these obligations will become payable between 2029 and 2033. If and when due, up to 25% of the milestone payments can be settled with our ordinary shares.
Commitments related to licensors and financial advisors
We have obligations to make future payments to third parties that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones (such as the start of a clinical trial, filing of a BLA, approval by the FDA or product launch) or as a result of collecting payments related to our License Sale to CSL Behring. We also owe payments to a financial advisor related to certain payments we will collect under the CSL Behring Agreement.
Commitments related to the CSA and DMSA with Genezen
​
Our CSA with Genezen requires us to take or pay contract manufacturing services for HEMGENIX® during a three-year period ending July 2027. As of December 31, 2024, our remaining minimum purchase commitments to Genezen amount to $36.5 million, with $15.8 million to be paid within the next 12 months. CSL Behring’s minimum purchase commitments to us over the next 12 months are $13.6 million.

We had previously incurred losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our business was founded by our predecessor entity AMT Holding N.V. in 1998, with the exception of generating income in 2021 after receiving the upfront payment upon Closing of the CSL Behring Agreement. We continued to incur losses in the current period. We recorded a net loss of $239.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and net loss of $308.5 million in 2023, and a net loss of $126.8 million in 2022. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,130.0 million.
​
Sources of liquidity
​
From our first institutional venture capital financing in 2006 through the current period, we funded our operations primarily through private and public placements of equity securities, debt securities, payments from our collaboration partners as well as $370.1 million from selling a portion of royalties due from our collaboration partner CSL Behring in 2023. Between July 2021 and July 2023, we have collected $617.4 million from CSL Behring as a result of the sale of HEMGENIX® to CSL and other milestones collected from CSL, and we are eligible to receive additional milestone payments, as well as royalties (to the extent not owed to settle the liability from the Royalty Financing Transaction) on net sales of HEMGENIX®.
In January 2025, we raised $70.1 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, through a follow-on public offering of 4.4 million ordinary shares at a price to the public of $17.00 per ordinary share. In February 2025, we raised an additional $10.6 million in net proceeds upon the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase an additional 0.7 million ordinary shares at the public offering price.
​
On May 12, 2023 we and Hercules amended our debt facility. The amendment extends the Maturity Date and interest-only period from December 2025 to January 2027. In connection with the Closing of the Lexington Transaction in July 2024 we amended the debt facility again and repaid $50.0 million of the principal balance outstanding. We are required to repay the remaining principal balance of $50.0 million on the Maturity Date. The interest rate is adjustable and is the greater of (i) 7.95% and (ii) 7.95% plus the prime rate less 3.25% per annum. We owe a back-end fee of $2.4 million on December 1, 2025 and a back-end fee of $0.6 million on the Maturity Date.
We are subject to certain covenants under the debt facility and may become subject to covenants under any future indebtedness that could limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends, which could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. In addition, our pledge of assets as collateral to secure our obligations under the 2024 Amended Facility may limit our ability to obtain debt financing. The debt facility permits us to issue up to $500.0 million of convertible debt.

Table of Contents
To the extent we need to finance our cash needs through equity offerings or debt financings, such financing may be subject to unfavorable terms including without limitation, the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation, as well as credit and debt market conditions, and we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If financing is not available when needed, including through debt or equity financings, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our cash needs. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.

7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
.
​
We are exposed to a variety of financial risks in the normal course of our business, including market risk (including currency, price, and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. Our overall risk management program focuses on preservation of capital and the unpredictability of financial markets and has sought to minimize potential adverse effects on our financial performance and position. 
​
​
Market Risk
​
Currency risk
​
We are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies, primarily with respect to the U.S. dollar and euro and to a lesser extent to the British pound and the Swiss Franc. As our U.S. operating entity primarily conducts its operations in U.S. dollars, its exposure to changes in foreign currency is insignificant. Similarly, the exposure to changes in foreign currencies of our Swiss and French entities are insignificant as well.
​
Our Dutch entities hold significant amounts of U.S. dollars in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities, have debt and interest obligations to Hercules denominated in U.S. dollars, generate collaboration revenue denominated in U.S. dollars, receive services from vendors denominated in U.S. dollars and occasionally British Pounds and fund the operations of our U.S. operating entity in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency denominated account receivables and account payables are short-term in nature (generally 30 to 45 days).
​
Variations in exchange rates will impact earnings and other comprehensive income or loss. On December 31, 2024, if the euro had weakened 10% against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant, pre-tax loss for the year would have been $25.0 million higher (December 31, 2023: pre-tax loss $6.0 million higher), and other comprehensive income would have been $11.0 million higher (December 31, 2023: other comprehensive loss $0.3 million higher). Conversely, if the euro had strengthened 10% against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant, pre-tax loss for the year would have been $25.0 million lower (December 31, 2023: pre-tax loss $6.0 million lower), and other comprehensive income would have been $12.1 million lower (December 31, 2023: other comprehensive loss $2.6 million lower).

​
We strive to mitigate foreign exchange risk through holding sufficient funds in euro and dollars to finance budgeted cash flows for generally 18 months.
​
The sensitivity in other comprehensive income to fluctuations in exchange rates primarily relates to the translation of the net assets of our Dutch entities from their functional currency euro into our reporting currency U.S. dollar.
​
Price risk
​
The market prices for the provision of preclinical and clinical materials and services, as well as external contracted research, may vary over time.
​
The commercial prices of any of our products or product candidates are currently uncertain.
​
We are not exposed to commodity price risk.
​
We do not hold investments classified as available-for-sale or at fair value through profit or loss; therefore, we are not exposed to equity securities price risk.
​
Interest rate risk
​
Our interest rate risk arises from short- and long-term debt and investment securities. 
​
In June 2013, we entered into the Hercules Agreement, which was last amended in July 2024, under which our borrowings bear interest at a variable rate with a fixed floor. Long-term debt issued at fixed rates expose us to fair value interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2024, the loan bore an interest rate of 12.2%.
106
​

Table of Contents
​
As of December 31, 2024, if interest rates on borrowings had been 1.0% higher with all other variables held constant, pre-tax earnings for the year would have been $0.8 million lower (2023: $1.0 million lower; 2022: $1.0 million lower.)
​
We invest in government debt in accordance with our investment policy. We are exposed to interest rate risk as market interest rates could differ from the interest rates that we fix at the time of acquiring these investment securities. As we intend to hold these to maturity, we do not recognize changes in the fair value of our investment which are caused by changes in market interest rates. 
​
This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued at a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the fair value of our investment will probably decline. 
​
The duration of all of our investment securities held as of December 31, 2024, was between two to five months. Due to the relatively short-term nature of these financial instruments and our ability and intention to hold these investments to maturity, we believe there is no material exposure to interest rate risk. 
​
Credit Risk
​
Credit risk is managed on a consolidated basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, outstanding receivables and committed transactions with collaboration partners and security deposits paid to landlords. We currently have no debtors other than CSL Behring.
We deposited funds as security to our landlord related to our facility in Amsterdam. We also deposited funds to the provider of our U.S. corporate credit cards. The deposits are neither impaired nor past due.
Our cash and cash equivalents include bank balances, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments (with maturities of less than three months at the time of purchase) that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of fluctuation in value. Restricted cash includes deposits made in relation to facility leases. We also have short-term investment securities in U.S. and European government bonds maturing within two to five months. Our investment policy requires us to invest in U.S. and European government bonds with the highest investment credit rating. Due to the high credit quality of our counterparties, we believe there is no material exposure to credit risk in our portfolio of investment securities. 
​
Liquidity Risk
​
Based on our current operating plan, research and development plans and our timing expectations related to the progress of our programs, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities will fund our operations through the second half of 2027. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the timing of a potential BLA submission, approval and commercialization of AMT-130. We expect that we will require additional funding if we decide to advance any of our other clinical product candidates into late-stage clinical development.

In relation to our acquisition of 
uniQure France SAS
, we entered into commitments to make payments to the former shareholders upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. The commitments include payments related to post-acquisition services that we agreed to as part of the transaction. The timing of achieving these milestones, as well as whether the milestone will be achieved at all, and consequently the timing of payments is generally uncertain. We expect these obligations will become payable between 2029 and 2033. If and when due, up to 25% of the milestone payments can be settled with our ordinary shares

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
​
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. This rule defines internal control over financial reporting as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
​
We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. This assessment was performed under the direction and supervision of our CEO and CFO and based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting included testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls. In our management’s opinion, we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the COSO 2013 framework.
​
Our independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has also issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Their report is filed within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Inherent Limitations of Internal Controls
Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements due to error or fraud.
​
Changes in internal control over financial reporting
During the fourth quarter of 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

uniQure N.V.:
​
Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of uniQure N.V. and subsidiaries (‘the Company’) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, shareholders’ (deficit) / equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Basis for Opinions 
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (‘PCAOB’) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Valuation of intangible asset at initial recognition arising from favorable terms in the Commercial Supply Agreement
As described in Notes 3 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded an intangible asset valued at $16.7 million derived from the consideration received following the sale of the Lexington facility and based on the Commercial Supply Agreement entered into with Genezen. This intangible asset represents the rights to purchase HEMGENIX® at terms considered favorable to market terms. The valuation at initial recognition is based on the difference between the contractually agreed price under the Commercial Supply Agreement and the estimated commercial supply price for purchases to be made under the agreement.
We identified the valuation of the intangible asset at initial recognition arising from favorable terms in the Commercial Supply Agreement as a critical audit matter. We performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the significant assumptions used to value the intangible asset, individually and in the aggregate, and determined this assumption to be the commercial supply price. Minor changes in this assumption could have a significant impact on the valuation of the intangible asset at initial recognition A high degree of subjective auditor judgement was required to evaluate the commercial supply price assumption for the goods supplied under the agreement, due to the lack of direct observable commercial supply prices.

​

Table of Contents

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter:  
•
We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the valuation of the intangible asset. 
•
We evaluated management’s methodology for determining the commercial supply price in the absence of comparable agreements, by comparing management’s estimate of commercial supply price to contracts in place with other suppliers and to the Company’s historical production costs to assess the reasonableness of management’s commercial supply price assumption.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
​
1.
Corporate information
​
uniQure B.V. (the “Company”) was incorporated on January 9, 2012 as a private company with limited liability (
besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid
) under the laws of the Netherlands. The Company is a leader in the field of gene therapy and seeks to deliver to patients suffering from rare and other devastating diseases single treatments with potentially curative results. The Company’s business was founded in 1998 and was initially operated through its predecessor company, Amsterdam Molecular Therapeutics Holding N.V (“AMT”). In 2012, AMT undertook a corporate reorganization, pursuant to which uniQure B.V. acquired the entire business and assets of AMT and completed a share-for-share exchange with the shareholders of AMT. Effective February 10, 2014, in connection with its initial public offering, the Company converted into a public company with limited liability (
naamloze vennootschap
) and changed its legal name from uniQure B.V. to uniQure N.V.
​
The Company is registered in the trade register of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (
Kamer van Koophandel
) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands under number 54385229. The Company’s headquarters are in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and its registered office is located at Paasheuvelweg 25, Amsterdam 1105 BP, the Netherlands and its telephone number is +31 20 240 6000. The Company’s website address is www.uniqure.com. 
​
The Company’s ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and trade under the symbol “QURE.”
​
2.
Summary of significant accounting policies 
​
2.1         Basis of preparation
​
The Company prepared its consolidated financial statements in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to authoritative U.S. GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”).
​
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments and contingent consideration, which are recorded at fair value through profit or loss.
​
The consolidated financial statements are presented in United States (“U.S.”) dollars ($), except where otherwise indicated. Transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are presented in the transaction currency with the U.S. dollar amount included in parenthesis, converted at the foreign exchange rate as of the transaction date.
​
The consolidated financial statements presented have been prepared on a going concern basis based on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and the Company’s budgeted cash flows for the twelve months following the issuance date.
​
2.2

Use of estimates
​
The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP and Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and regulations, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to contingent consideration related to the acquisition of uniQure France SAS, the valuation of the intangible asset with favorable terms recorded as part of the sale the Company’s commercial manufacturing activities located in Lexington, MA (“Lexington Transaction”) in July 2024 and the date at which the Company expects to satisfy its commitment under the Royalty Financing Agreement (refer to definition in Note 2.3.27). If actual results differ from the Company’s estimates, or to the extent these estimates are adjusted in future periods, the Company’s results of operations could either benefit from, or be adversely affected by, any such change in estimate.

Accounting policies
​
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
​
2.3.1

Consolidation
​
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has a controlling financial interest either through variable interest or through voting interest. Currently, the Company is not involved with variable interest entities.
​
Inter-company transactions, balances, income, and expenses on transactions between uniQure entities are eliminated in consolidation. Profits and losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are recognized in assets are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Company.
​
2.3.2

Current versus non-current classification
​
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets based on current and non-current classification.
​
The term current assets is used to designate cash and other assets, or resources commonly identified as those that are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the business. The Company’s normal operating cycle is 
twelve months
. All other assets are classified as non-current.
​
The term current liabilities is used principally to designate obligations whose liquidation is reasonably expected to require the use of existing resources properly classifiable as current assets, or the creation of other current liabilities. Current liabilities are expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle. The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
​
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities, if any.
​
2.3.3

Foreign currency translation
​
The functional currency of the Company and each of its entities (except for uniQure Inc. and Corlieve AG) is the euro (€). This represents the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entities operate. The functional currency of uniQure Inc. is the U.S. dollar ($) and the functional currency of Corlieve AG is the Swiss Franc (CHF). The consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars.
​
Foreign currency transactions are measured and recorded in the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at exchange rates prevailing at balance sheet date are recognized in profit and loss.
​
Upon consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into the functional currency of the shareholding entity at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date; items of income and expense are translated at monthly average exchange rates. The consolidated assets and liabilities are translated from uniQure N.V.’s functional currency, euro, into the reporting currency U.S. dollar at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date; items of income and expense are translated at monthly average exchange rates. Issued capital and additional paid-in capital are translated at historical rates with differences to the balance sheet date rate recorded as translation adjustments in other comprehensive income / loss. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognized in “accumulated other comprehensive income / loss”. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income / loss relating to that foreign operation is recognized in profit or loss.

2.3.4

Fair value measurement
​
The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting. ASC 820
, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 requires disclosure of methodologies used in determining the reported fair values and establishes a hierarchy of inputs used when available. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
​
●
Level 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access at the measurement date.
​
●
Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or models for which the inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
​
●
Level 3 - Valuations that require inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions that are both significant to the fair value measurement and are unobservable.
​
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized as Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
​
Items measured at fair value on a recurring basis include financial instruments and contingent consideration (Note 7, “
Fair value measurement
”). The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable from licensing and collaboration partners, other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities.
​
2.3.5

Contingent consideration

​
Each reporting period, the Company revalues the contingent consideration obligations associated with the acquisition of uniQure France SAS in 2021 to their fair value and records changes in the fair value within research and development expenses. Changes in contingent consideration obligations result from changes in assumptions regarding the probabilities of achieving the relevant milestones, the estimated timing of achieving such milestones, and the interest rate to discount the milestone payments. The probability-adjusted payments are discounted to present value using a discount rate representing the Company’s credit risk. This discount rate is determined using the effective interest rate of the Company’s existing debt facility adjusted for difference in maturity dates based on market data on effective yields for U.S. bonds with a CCC credit rating.
​
Payments of portions of contingent consideration initially recorded as of the acquisition date are recorded as cash flows from financing activities, and payments, or the portion of the milestone payments representing changes in the fair value of contingent consideration subsequent to the initial recognition, are recorded as cash flows from operating activities.
​
Refer to Note 7 “
Fair value measurement
” for further information.

​
c.
Right to purchase
​
The Company entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement (“CSA”) with Genezen. The CSA provides the Company with rights to purchase HEMGENIX® at terms considered favorable to market terms. In accordance with ASC 805, 
Business Combinations,
 the Company recorded an intangible asset at its fair value with respect to these favorable terms at Closing. The intangible asset is stated at historical cost less accumulated amortization. The Company amortizes the intangible asset on a straight-line basis over a three-year term. The Company presents the amortization expense within Other expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
​
d.
Firm purchase commitment liability 
​
The CSA includes a minimum term of three years and minimum purchase commitments of HEMGENIX® over the first three years, unless certain contractual provisions are triggered. The Company expects to resell HEMGENIX® purchased from Genezen via its minimum commitments to CSL Behring at a loss. In accordance with ASC 330, 
Inventory, 
the Company recognized a liability related to the net losses expected from the purchase of these minimum commitments. The Company presents the current portion of the firm purchase commitment liability within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the non-current portion within other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company subsequently adjusts the liability for any changes to the losses expected to be incurred. The Company presents changes to the liability within other expenses. 
​
2.3.7

Notes to the consolidated statements of cash flows
​
The consolidated statements of cash flows have been prepared using the indirect method. The cash disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows is comprised of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Cash and cash equivalents include bank balances, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments (with maturities of less than three months at the time of purchase) that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of fluctuation in value.
​
Cash flows denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at the average exchange rates. Exchange differences, if any, affecting cash and cash equivalents are shown separately in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Interest paid and received, and income taxes are included in net cash (used in) / provided by operating activities.

Segment information
​
Operating segments are identified as a component of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company views its operations and manages its business as 
one
 operating segment, which comprises the discovery and development of innovative gene therapies.
​
2.3.9

Net loss per ordinary share
​
The Company follows the provisions of ASC 260
, Earnings Per Share
. In accordance with these provisions, net loss per ordinary share is calculated by dividing net (loss) / income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
​
Diluted net loss per ordinary share reflects the dilution that would occur if share options or warrants to issue ordinary shares were exercised, performance or restricted share units were distributed, or shares under the employee share purchase plan were issued. However, potential ordinary shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive.
​
Refer to Note 22 “
Basic and diluted earnings per share
” for further information.
​
2.3.10

Impairment of long-lived assets
​
Long-lived assets, which include property, plant, and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Right-of-use assets are also reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360
, Property, Plant, and Equipment
. The recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group depends on the successful execution of the Company’s business initiatives and its ability to earn sufficient returns on approved products and product candidates. When events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the assets. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. 
​
2.3.11

Goodwill and acquired research and development intangible asset
​
a.
Goodwill
​
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if the Company becomes aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. In the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company has not recognized any impairment charges related to goodwill. 
​
b.
Acquired research and development 
​
As part of the acquisition of uniQure France SAS in 2021 the Company recorded an In-process research and development intangible asset related to the AMT-260 program (“IPR&D Intangible Asset”). The IPR&D Intangible Asset is considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts and is not amortized. If and when development is completed, which would occur when regulatory approval to market a candidate for the treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy is obtained, the associated asset would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on its respective useful life at that point in time. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company has not recognized any impairment charges related to the IPR&D Intangible Asset.
​
124
​

Table of Contents
In case of abandonment, the IPR&D Intangible Asset will be written-off. In accordance with ASC 350, 
Intangibles – Goodwill and Other
, the Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if the Company becomes aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate the fair value of the IPR&D Intangible Asset is below its carrying amount.
​
2.3.12

Investment securities
​
Investment securities consist of sovereign debt with residual maturities of less than 12 months (presented as current) and beyond (presented as non-current). The Company classifies these securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities in which the Company has the ability and intent to hold the security until maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost, adjusted for applicable accrued interest and the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the term of the related held-to-maturity security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest rate method. 
​
Investment securities with original maturities of 90 days or less when purchased are presented within cash and cash equivalents (December 31, 2024: $
15.3
 million, December 31, 2023: 
nil
). 
​
A decline in the market value of any investment security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to operations and a new cost base for the security is established. Other-than-temporary impairment charges are included in interest and other income (expense), net. Interest income is recognized when earned. 
​
Refer to Note 5 “
Investment securities
” for further information.
​
2.3.13

Accounts receivable
​
Accounts receivables include amounts due from services provided to CSL Behring as well as unconditional rights to consideration from CSL Behring.
​
2.3.14

Inventories
​
The Company started producing commercial materials in April 2022 to supply CSL Behring in accordance with a June 2020 Development and Commercial Supply Agreement between the Company and CSL Behring. From this date until the Closing of the Lexington Transaction in July 2024, the Company presented the costs associated with the aforementioned activities as cost of contract manufacturing. 
​
Per ASC 330
,

Inventory
, inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company capitalized raw materials to the extent these were used in contract manufacturing for CSL Behring. The Company used standard costs, approximating average costs to determine its cost basis for work in progress and finished goods. The Company’s assessment of recoverability value required the use of estimates regarding the net realizable value of its inventory balances, including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventory. As applicable, write-downs resulting from adjustments to net realizable value were recorded to cost of contract manufacturing.

​
2.3.15

Prepaid expenses
​
Prepaid expenses are amounts paid in the period, for which the benefit has not been realized, and include payments made for insurance and research and clinical contracts. The related expense will be recognized in the subsequent period as incurred.
​
2.3.16

Other(non) current assets
​
Deposits paid are either presented as other current assets or as other non-current assets based on duration of the underlying contractual arrangement. Deposits are classified as restricted cash and primarily relate to facility leases. 
​
Contract assets are presented in current assets or as non-current assets based on the timing of the right to consideration. 
​

2.3.17

Property, plant, and equipment
​
Property, plant, and equipment is comprised mainly of laboratory equipment, leasehold improvements, construction-in-progress (“CIP”) and office equipment. All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. CIP consists of capitalized expenses associated with construction of assets not yet placed into service. Depreciation commences on CIP once the asset is placed into service based on its useful life determined at that time.
​
Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred. Upon disposal, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss on the transaction is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
​
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (or in the case of leasehold improvements a shorter lease term), which are as follows:
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
·    Leasehold improvements

Between 
10
 – 
15 years
·    Laboratory equipment
​
5 years
·    Office equipment
​
Between 
3
 – 
5 years
​
2.3.18

Leases
​
The Company records leases in accordance with ASC 842
, Leases
 and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date calculated using an incremental borrowing rate applicable to the lease asset unless the implicit rate is readily available. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Leases with a term of twelve months or less are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets. 
​
The Company recognizes lease cost on a straight-line basis and presents these costs as operating expenses within the Consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company presents lease payments within cash flows from operations within the Consolidated statements of cash flows.
​
2.3.19    Accounts payable and accrued expenses
​
Accounts payables are invoiced amounts related to obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payables are recognized at the amounts invoiced by suppliers.
​
Accrued expenses are recognized for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business.
​
Contract liabilities, if any, are presented in accrued expenses.
​
2.3.20 

Long-term debt
​
Long-term debt is initially recognized at cost and presented net of original issue discount or premium and debt issuance costs on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs is recognized as interest expense in profit and loss over the period of the debt, using the effective interest rate method.
​
2.3.21    Pensions and other post-retirement benefit plans
​
The Company maintains a defined contribution pension plan for all employees in the Netherlands, which is funded by the Company through payments to an insurance company, with individual accounts for each participants’ assets. The Company has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the plan does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to services rendered in the current and prior periods. The contributions are expensed as incurred. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
​
126
​

Table of Contents
The Company maintains a qualified 401(k) Plan for all employees located in the United States. The 401(k) Plan offers both a pre-tax and post-tax (Roth) component. Employees may contribute up to the IRS statutory limit each calendar year. The Company matches $
0.50
 for every $
1.00
 contributed to the plan by participants up to 
6
% of base compensation. Employer contributions are recognized as they are contributed, as long as the employee is rendering services in that period. If employer contributions are made in periods after an individual retires or terminates, the estimated cost is accrued during the employee’s service period.
​
Expenses under the defined contribution plans were $
2.7
 million, $
3.6
 million and $
2.7
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
​
The Company maintains a defined benefit plan for its Swiss employees, including retirement benefit plans required by applicable local law. The Company accounts for pension assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 715, 
Compensation - Retirement Benefits
, which requires the recognition of the funded status of pension plans in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The liability in respect to defined benefit pension plan is the projected benefit obligation calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
​
The projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 represents the actuarial present value of the estimated future payments required to settle the obligation that is attributable to employee services rendered before that date. Service cost is reported in research and development and general and administrative expenses. All other components of net period costs are reported in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Plan assets are recorded at their fair value. Gains or losses arising from plan curtailments or settlements are accounted for at the time they occur. Actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between the actual and the expected return on plan assets are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
​
2.3.22    Share-based compensation
​
The Company accounts for its share-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718
, Compensation-Stock Compensation.
​
All the Company’s share-based compensation plans for employees are equity-classified. ASC 718 requires all share-based compensation to employees, including grants of employee options, restricted share units, performance share units and modifications to existing instruments, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on their grant-date fair values, net of an estimated forfeiture rate, over the requisite service period. Forfeitures of employee options are recognized as they occur. Compensation expense related to Performance Share Units is recognized when the Company considers achievement of the milestones to be probable. The requirements of ASC 718 are also applied to nonemployee share-based payment transactions except for specific guidance on certain inputs to an option-pricing model and the attribution of cost. 
​
The Company uses a Hull & White option model to determine the fair value of option awards. The model captures early exercises by assuming that the likelihood of exercises will increase when the share-price reaches defined multiples of the strike price. This analysis is performed over the full contractual term.

​
2.3.26

Income taxes
​
Income taxes are recorded in accordance with ASC 740
, Income Taxes
, which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided, if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
​
The benefits of tax positions are recognized only if those positions are more likely than not, based on the technical merits, to be sustained upon examination. Recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more-likely-than-not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company did not have any significant unrecognized tax benefits.
​
2.3.27

Royalty Financing Agreement
​
In May 2023, uniQure biopharma B.V. (“uniQure biopharma”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into an agreement (the “Royalty Financing Agreement”) with the HemB SPV, L.P. (the “Purchaser”) to sell certain current and future royalties due to uniQure biopharma from CSL Behring under the CSL Behring Agreement by and between uniQure biopharma and CSL Behring from the net sales of HEMGENIX®. Refer to Note 13 
“Royalty Financing Agreement”
 for further details of the Royalty Financing Agreement. The Company determined that the Royalty Financing Agreement should be accounted for as debt in accordance with topic ASC 470, 
Debt
. The Company initially recognized the debt at fair value. The Company subsequently records the debt at amortized cost and determines the effective interest rate based on its projection of contractual cash flows. Interest expense (presented as “Interest Expense” in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) / income) is recorded over the projected repayment period using the effective interest method. The Company periodically assesses and adjusts the effective interest rate to reflect changes in projected cash flows. The Company prospectively applies the adjusted effective interest rate following the date of change.
​
In accordance with topic ASC 835, 
Interest
, debt issuance costs incurred in relation to the Royalty Financing Agreement are presented as a reduction of carrying amount of the debt. Debt issuance cost is amortized together with the interest expense recorded.
​
Interest expense, net of interest paid is presented as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 
​
2.3.28

Restructuring expenses
​
Restructuring charges consist of one-time termination benefits. The Company records one-time termination benefits in accordance with ASC 420, 
Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations

Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-07”). This update requires the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”).

On June 29, 2024, affiliates of the Company agreed with Genezen to sell the Company’s commercial manufacturing activities located in Lexington, MA. The Lexington Transaction closed on July 22, 2024. 
​
Genezen extended offers of employment to a significant majority of the Company’s employees located at the Lexington facility (the “Lexington Facility”), with the remaining employees terminated effective August 30, 2024. 
​
uniQure Inc. and uniQure B.V., both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered into an APA with Genezen on June 29, 2024. Pursuant to the APA, Genezen agreed to acquire the manufacturing facility including equipment and related manufacturing operations with a carrying value of $
15.2
 million, inventory with a carrying value of $
8.8
 million and certain other assets (including allocated goodwill) with a carrying value of $
2.8
 million associated with the Lexington Facility on Closing.
​
As consideration, the Company received (i) shares of newly issued Series C preferred stock of Genezen Holdings Inc. which are convertible into Genezen common stock and will accrue an 
8.0
%
 per annum cumulative dividend, (ii) a convertible promissory note with a nominal amount of 
$
12.5
 million, bearing interest at 
8.0
%
 per annum and maturing 
63 months
 following the date of issuance and (iii) a right to purchase HEMGENIX® at terms considered favorable to market terms. The Company also included a firm purchase commitment liability for its customer contract with CSL Behring inherently related to the right to purchase HEMGENIX® in the consideration received.
​
The Company recorded the Series C preferred stock in Genezen Holdings Inc. issued to the Company at Closing at its fair market value of $
12.5
 million. The Series C preferred stock had a carrying value of $
11.8
 million as of December 31, 2024. 
​
The convertible promissory note was recognized at its fair value of $
13.3
 million at Closing. The convertible promissory note had a balance of $
13.7
 million as of December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $
0.4
 million of interest income. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not recorded an allowance for credit losses related to the convertible promissory note.
​
uniQure Inc., Genezen and the landlord of the Lexington Facility entered into an agreement for uniQure to assign and Genezen to assume the existing lease agreement between uniQure and the landlord at Closing. The Company also amended its original July 2013 guarantee to continue guaranteeing rental payments owed by Genezen until the end of the current term on May 31, 2029. In the event of Genezen’s default related to rental payments owed to the landlord, uniQure is entitled to terminate the assignment agreement and step into the original lease agreement. On Closing, the Company de-recognized its right of use asset with a carrying amount of $
11.8
 million and related lease liability for the facility of $
17.7
 million. Following the Closing, $
1.7
 million of deposits were released and reclassified from restricted cash into cash.
​
At Closing, uniQure Inc. entered into a CSA with Genezen. Pursuant to the terms of the CSA, the parties agreed to subcontract the manufacturing of HEMGENIX® to Genezen. The CSA includes a minimum term of 
three years
 and minimum purchase commitments of HEMGENIX® commercial supplies of 
$
43.3
 million over the first 
three years
, unless certain contractual provisions are triggered. The CSA provides the Company with rights to purchase HEMGENIX® at terms considered favorable to market terms. In accordance with ASC 805 
Business Combinations
, the Company recorded an intangible asset valued at 
$
16.7
 million with respect to these favorable terms. The intangible asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a 
three-year
 term, commencing at Closing. Amortization expense of 
$
2.5
 million (presented within Other expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss) was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024. 
​

​

Table of Contents
The Company’s obligations with respect to the supply of HEMGENIX® to CSL Behring pursuant to the Development and Commercial Supply Agreement between uniQure biopharma and CSL Behring Inc (the “DCSA”) remain in effect notwithstanding the subcontracting to Genezen. The Company expects to resell HEMGENIX® material purchased from Genezen via its minimum commitments to CSL Behring at a loss. In accordance with ASC 330 
Inventory
, the Company, at Closing, recognized a liability of $
8.8
 million related to the net losses expected from the purchase of these minimum commitments. The liability was accounted for as a reduction of the consideration received. As of December 31, 2024, the Company classified $
1.6
 million of the liability as Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $
4.8
 million within Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
​
The Lexington Transaction was accounted for as a divestment of the Company’s commercial manufacturing activities. The total net consideration received of $
25.4
 million, less costs associated with the sale of $
3.3
 million, exceeded the $
20.9
 million fair market value of the net assets transferred (including allocated goodwill) by $
1.2
 million. The excess over the fair market value was recognized as a net gain in Other income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
​
At Closing, the Company paid a total of $
8.3
 million to Genezen and CSL related to adjustments of working capital and to obtain consent to proceed with the divestiture.
​
Additionally, uniQure biopharma entered into a development and other manufacturing services agreement (“DMSA”) with Genezen at Closing. Pursuant to the DMSA, the Company is entitled to receive, as a preferred customer, manufacturing and development services to support the Company’s investigational gene therapy programs and other services related to HEMGENIX® (other than its manufacturing and supply obligations under the CSA). The DMSA has a minimum term of 
three years
 and requires the Company to purchase services for a total minimum of 
$
14.0
 million.
​
4.            Restructuring 
​
In 2024, as part of the Lexington Transaction, the Company terminated certain employees that did not transfer to Genezen. The Company incurred $
1.4
 million of expenses related to termination benefits offered to these employees, which were recorded as Research and Development Expense and Selling, General and Administrative Expense during the year ended December 31, 2024.
​
On August 1, 2024, the Company announced a global organizational restructuring. As a result, the Company recorded $
3.8
 million of severance and other personnel-related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2024.
​

7.            Fair value measurement 
​
The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting.
​
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable from licensing and collaboration partners, other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities reflected in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values due to their short-term maturities.
​
The Company’s material financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and investment securities. Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are measured at fair value using Level 1 inputs. Restricted cash is included within “Other non-current assets” within the consolidated balance sheets. Investment securities are measured at amortized cost.

Contingent consideration
​
The Company is required to pay up to EUR 
143.1
 million ($
148.6
 million at the December 31, 2024 foreign exchange rate) to the former shareholders of uniQure France SAS (formerly Corlieve Therapeutics SAS) upon the achievement of the remaining contractually defined milestones in connection with the Company’s acquisition of uniQure France in 
2021
.
​
The fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to this acquisition as of December 31, 2024 was $
10.9
 million (December 31, 2023: $
43.0
 million) using discount rates of approximately 
15.3
% to 
16.2
% (December 31, 2023: 
15.3
% to 
15.6
%). 
​
Following the clearance of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for AMT-260 in August 2023, the Company had increased the probability of achieving a EUR 
30.0
 million ($
33.1
 million) milestone payment following the dosing of the first patient in Phase I/II clinical trial from 
66.0
% to 
100.0
%. This also resulted in an increase of the probability that AMT-260 may advance to late-stage development and commercialization.
​
In December 2024, a milestone payment of EUR 
30.0
 million ($
31.5
 million) was paid, of which EUR 
26.8
 million ($
28.2
 million) related to contingent consideration. In September 2023, a milestone payment of EUR 
10.0
 million ($
10.6
 million) was paid, of which EUR 
8.9
 million ($
9.6
 million) related to contingent consideration. 
​
If as of December 31, 2024 the Company had assumed a 
100
% likelihood of AMT-260 advancing into a Phase III clinical study, then the fair value of the contingent consideration would have increased to EUR 
33.7
 million ($
35.0
 million). If as of December 31, 2024 the Company had assumed that it would discontinue development of the AMT-260 program, then the contingent consideration would have been released to income. 
​
As of December 31, 2024, the Company classified 
no
ne of the total contingent consideration of $
10.9
 million as current liabilities. The balance sheet classification between current and non-current liabilities is based upon the Company’s best estimate of the timing of settlement of the remaining relevant milestones.  
​
Derivative financial instruments 
​
Derivative financial instruments BMS
​
In December 2020, as part of the amended BMS CLA, the Company and BMS had agreed that upon the consummation of a change of control transaction of uniQure occurring prior to December 2026 or BMS’ delivery of a cessation notice (as contractually defined) the Company (or its third party acquirer) should have paid to BMS a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable contractually defined payment (“CoC-payment”). The amended BMS CLA was terminated on February 21, 2023. 
​
The Company had previously determined that the CoC-payment should be recorded as a derivative financial liability upon initial recognition and that subsequent changes in the fair market value of this derivative financial liability should be recorded in profit and loss. As a result of the derecognition of the derivative financial liability in the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $
2.8
 million gain within “Other non-operating (losses) / gains”. 
​
Other
​
As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $
0.4
 million liabilities related to consideration for post-acquisition services, presented within Other non-current liabilities in connection with the Company’s acquisition of uniQure France SAS (December 31, 2023: $
0.5
 million).

12.           Long-term debt
​
On June 14, 2013, the Company entered into a venture debt loan facility with Hercules Capital, Inc. (formerly known as Hercules Technology Growth Capital, Inc.) (“Hercules”). The facility was amended and restated in 2014, 2016, 2018, January 2021, December 2021 (the “2021 Restated Facility”), and on May 12, 2023 (the “2023 Amended Facility”) and July 22, 2024 (the “2024 Amended Facility”). 
​
On July 19, 2024, in connection with the Closing of the Lexington Transaction and the amendment of the 2023 Amended Facility, the Company prepaid $
50.0
 million of the $
100.0
 million of principal outstanding as well as $
3.1
 million in end-of-term fees. 
​
The 2023 Amended Facility extended the maturity date and interest-only period from December 1, 2025 to January 5, 2027 (the “Maturity Date”). 
​
The total principal outstanding as of December 31, 2024 under the 2024 Amended Facility was $
50.0
 million. 
​
The Company is required to repay the residual principal balance on the Maturity Date. The interest rate is adjustable and is the greater of (i) 
7.95
%
 and (ii) 
7.95
%
 plus the 
prime rate
 less 
3.25
%
 per annum. Pursuant to the terms of the 2024 Amended Facility, the Company owes a back-end fee of 
$
2.4
 million on December 1, 2025 and a back-end fee of 
$
0.6
 million on the Maturity Date. 
​
The amortized cost (including interest due presented as part of accrued expenses and other current liabilities) of the 2024 Amended Facility was $
51.9
 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to an amortized cost of $
102.9
 million as of December 31, 2023, and is recorded net of discount and debt issuance costs. The foreign currency loss on the loan was $
4.1
 million in 2024 (2023: gain of $
3.0
 million; 2022: loss of $
5.8
 million). The fair value of the loan approximates its carrying amount. Inputs to the fair value of the loan are considered Level 3 inputs. 

​
Interest expense recorded during the years ended December 31 was as follows:

Under the 2024 Amended Facility the Company must remain current in its periodic reporting requirements and is required to keep a minimum cash balance deposited in bank accounts in the United States, equivalent to the lesser of (i) 
65
% of the outstanding balance of principal due or (ii) 
100
% of worldwide cash and cash equivalents. This restriction on cash and cash equivalents only relates to the location of the cash and cash equivalents, and such cash and cash equivalents can be used at the discretion of the Company. Beginning on April 1, 2024, the Company is required to keep a minimum of unrestricted cash of at least 
30
% of the loan amount outstanding. In combination with other covenants, the 2024 Amended Facility restricts the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur future indebtedness and obtain additional debt financing, to make investments in securities or in other companies, to transfer assets, to perform certain corporate changes, to make loans to employees, officers, and directors, and to make dividend payments and other distributions to its shareholders. The Company secured the facilities by directly or indirectly pledging its total assets of $
556.5
 million, less $
4.1
 million of cash and cash equivalents and other current assets held by the Company and $
80.5
 million of other current assets and investment held by uniQure France SAS as well as receivables sold to the Purchaser.
​
Under the 2024 Amended Facility, the occurrence of a material adverse effect, as defined therein, would entitle Hercules to declare all principal, interest and other amounts owed by the Company immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in material compliance with all covenants and provisions.

13.            Royalty Financing Agreement
​
On May 12, 2023, the Company entered into the Royalty Financing Agreement with the Purchaser. Under the terms of the Royalty Financing Agreement the Company received an upfront payment of $
375.0
 million in exchange for its rights to the lowest royalty tier on CSL Behring’s worldwide net sales of HEMGENIX® for certain current and future royalties due to the Company. The Company will be obligated to pay $
25.0
 million of the first worldwide sales milestone payment from CSL Behring, if received, to the Purchaser.
​
The Purchaser will receive 
1.85
 times the upfront payment (or $
693.8
 million) until June 30, 2032 (“First Hard Cap Date”) if such thresholds are met or, if such cap is not met by June 30, 2032, up to 
2.25
 times of the upfront payment through December 31, 2038 (“Second Hard Cap Date”). If, on or prior to the defined dates for each cap amount, the total amount of royalty payments received by the Purchaser equals or exceeds the cap amount applicable to such date, the Royalty Financing Agreement will automatically terminate and all rights to the HEMGENIX® royalty payments will revert back to the Company. The Company has no obligation to repay any amounts received from the Purchaser in the event that the applicable cap amount is not reached during the term of the Royalty Financing Agreement. 
​
The Company has retained the rights to all other royalties, as well as commercial milestones totaling up to $
1.3
 billion, under the terms of the CSL Behring Agreement.
​
Net proceeds from the Royalty Financing Agreement, after deducting professional and financial advisory fees related to the transaction of $
4.9
 million, were $
370.1
 million. The Company initially recorded these net proceeds as “Liability from royalty financing agreement” at their fair market value on its balance sheet as of closing of the transaction on June 5, 2023. Following the initial recognition, the Company records the debt at amortized cost.
​
As of December 31, 2024 the Company expects to satisfy its commitment to the Purchaser prior to the Second Hard Cap Date. The Company until December 2024 assumed that it would satisfy the commitments to the Purchaser prior to the First Hard Cap Date. This change in assumption did not have a material impact on the amount of debt or interest expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company will record the difference of $
473.7
 million between the total expected payments of $
843.8
 million to the Purchaser and the $
370.1
 million net proceeds as interest expense using the effective interest rate method. The Company determined the effective interest rate based on the projected cash flows up to the Second Hard Cap Date. Based on the Company’s projections the effective interest rate is expected to be within a range of 
12.0
% to 
13.5
% per annum, which is consistent with the range that was used prior to the change in assumption in December 2024. The Company would have recorded the following amounts:

14.          Retirement benefits
​
Defined benefit pension plan
​
The Company operates a defined benefit pension plan for its Swiss employees (the “Swiss Plan”) in accordance with local regulations and practices. The normal retirement age under the Swiss Plan is 65 years. All benefits are immediately vested. Under the Swiss Plan, a percentage of pensionable salary is contributed as a retirement credit with additional contributions being made for death and disability benefits. Under Swiss pension law, participants who are covered by the pension plan of another employer are required to transfer the termination benefit of that pension plan into the plan of the Company. When employment at the Company ends before reaching retirement, the termination benefit is transferred out of the defined benefit pension plan. At time of retirement the accumulated retirement credit can be converted into a life-long annuity or be paid-out as a lump-sum. Participants are also permitted to withdraw a part of the accumulated termination benefit in special circumstances before reaching retirement age for example for payments related to obtain home ownership.
​
The Company initially recognized its net projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2023 at a carrying amount of CHF 
2.1
 million ($
2.6
 million), presented within other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)

​
In June 2018, the Company’s shareholders adopted and approved an ESPP allowing the Company to issue up to 
150,000

Under the ESPP, employees are eligible to purchase ordinary shares through payroll deductions, subject to any plan limitations. The purchase price of the shares on each purchase date is equal to 
85

10,150
 ordinary shares have been issued (December 31, 2023: 
19,198
 and December 31, 2022: 
11,242
). As of December 31, 2024, a total of

17.          Segment reporting
​
The Company is advancing a pipeline of innovative gene therapies seeking to deliver to patients suffering from rare and other devastating diseases single treatments with potentially curative results. The Company manages the operations related to these research and development activities within one operating segment because they rely on a common set of infrastructure, resources and technology of the products and production processes, types of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environment. 
​
The leadership team is identified as the CODM. 
​
The CODM allocates resources to research projects and clinical candidates based on scientific data as well as quantitative and qualitative expected risk adjusted returns on investment. The CODM uses segment operating loss to monitor that cash operating losses remain within the approved budget.
​
The Company does not evaluate performance or allocate resources based on segment asset data and therefore such information is not presented. Refer to Note 8 “
Property, plant and equipment, net
” and Note 9 “
Right-of-use asset and lease liabilities
” for geographic information related to long-lived assets.
​
The accounting policies of the operating segment are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

Contract manufacturing revenue from CSL Behring
​
The Company provided contract manufacturing services to CSL Behring from April 2022 until the July 2024 divestment of the commercial manufacturing activities to Genezen. 
Following the Closing of the Lexington Transaction, title to HEMGENIX® supply directly passes from the contract manufacturer, Genezen, to CSL Behring. The Company does not control HEMGENIX® before it is transferred to CSL Behring. The Company arranges for HEMGENIX® to be provided by Genezen to CSL Behring. The Company determined that it is an agent in the sale of HEMGENIX® to CSL Behring.  
​
The Company’s 
development and commercial supply agreement requires the Company to supply HEMGENIX
®
 to CSL Behring until such time that these capabilities are transferred to CSL Behring or a contract manufacturing organization designated by CSL Behring. On September 6, 2022, CSL Behring notified the Company of its intent to transfer manufacturing technology related to HEMGENIX
® 
in the coming years to a third-party contract manufacturer designated by CSL Behring.

$
6.1
 million, 
$

The valuation allowance of $
191.9

178.7
 million ($
185.6
 million) deferred tax assets in the Netherlands resulting from net operating loss carryforwards of EUR 
153.1
  million ($
159.1

​
Netherlands
​
As of December 31, 2024, the total amount of net operating losses carried forward under the Dutch tax regime was EUR 
593.6
 million ($
616.5
 million) (December 31, 2023: EUR 
446.4
 million ($
492.7
 million)). The Company has historically recorded a full valuation allowance. The Company evaluates all positive and negative evidence in assessing the need for a full valuation allowance. Management considers reversing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company concluded that as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023 it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company’s Dutch net operating tax losses carried forward relate to 2019, 2022, 2023 and 2024.
​

​

Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2024, the tax treatment of the Royalty Agreement has not been agreed with the Dutch tax authorities. A different tax treatment could result in a different categorization of temporary differences and an offsetting deferred tax asset.
​
A portion of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2024 continues to relate to follow-on offering costs incurred in 2019. Any subsequently recognized tax benefits will be credited directly to contributed capital. As of December 31, 2024, that amount was EUR 
3.0
 million ($
3.2
 million) and EUR 
3.0
 million ($
3.4
 million) as of December 31, 2023. 
​
The Dutch corporate tax rate is 
25.8
% from 2022 onwards.
​
Net operating loss carryforwards subject to a limit of offsetting taxable profit in excess of EUR 1.0 million to 50% of the taxable profit can be carried forward indefinitely.
​
The fiscal periods from 2022 onwards are still open for inspection by the Dutch tax authorities.
​
United States of America
​
The federal corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 
21.0
%. In addition, the Company is subject to state income taxes resulting in a combined tax rate of 
27.3
% for its U.S. operation. As of December 31, 2024, an estimated $
22.9
 million of net operating losses remain to be carried forward. These net operating losses carried forward will expire in 2036 and 2037 except for $
0.7
 million which can be carried forward indefinitely with a deduction limited to 80% of taxable income in a given year.
​
The Company’s U.S. operations have been generating taxable income since 2018 with the exception of 2022. The Company expects to continue to generate taxable income in the U.S. during the foreseeable future. 
​
Under the provision of the Internal Revenue Code, the U.S. net operating losses carried forward may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative exchange in the ownership interest of significant shareholders over a three-year period in excess of 50 percent, as defined under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation.
​
The fiscal periods from 2021 are still open for inspection by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS or Massachusetts Department of Revenue to the extent utilized in a future period. The Company is currently not under examination by the IRS for any tax years.
​
France
​
The French corporate tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was 
25.0
%. In addition, the Company is subject to a surcharge of 
3.3
% of the 
25.0
% standard corporate tax rate resulting in a combined rate of 
25.8
%.
​
The Company’s French operations have incurred losses since incorporation and are expected to continue incurring tax losses for the foreseeable future. The French operations as of December 31, 2024 have an estimated EUR 
48.9
 million ($
50.8
 million) (December 31, 2023: EUR 
35.9
 million ($
39.6
 million)) of net operating losses that are available for carry forward indefinitely. The Company recorded a partial valuation allowance during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
No
 such valuation allowance was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. The Company evaluates all positive and negative evidence including future income from reversing taxable temporary differences (particularly from reversing the deferred tax liability related to the acquired IPR&D intangible asset), projected future taxable income subject to the loss limitation rules applicable in France and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment.

22.          Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share
​
Basic net loss per ordinary share is computed by dividing net loss for the period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. As the Company has incurred a loss in the years presented, all potentially dilutive ordinary shares for these years would have an antidilutive effect, if converted, and thus have been excluded from the computation of loss per share.

Commitments and contingencies
​
In the course of its business, the Company enters as a licensee into contracts with other parties regarding the development and marketing of its pipeline products. Among other payment obligations, the Company is obligated to pay royalties to the licensors based on future sales levels and milestone payments whenever specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones are met. As both future sales levels and the timing and achievement of milestones are uncertain, the financial effect of these agreements cannot be estimated reliably.
 The Company also has obligations to make future payments that become due and payable upon the collection of milestone payments from CSL Behring. The achievement and timing of these milestones is not fixed and determinable. Relevant commitments and contingencies are further discussed in other sections of this form 10-K, such as, 
Note 3 “
Divestiture of manufacturing facility
”
 and Note 18 “
Collaboration arrangements and concentration of credit risk
”, amongst others.
