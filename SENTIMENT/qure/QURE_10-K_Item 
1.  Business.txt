Huntington’s disease program (AMT-130) 
RMAT Designation
In June 2024, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted us Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation for AMT-130 based on the potential of AMT-130 to address the major unmet medical need among patients with Huntington’s disease. The designation followed the FDA’s review of interim Phase I/II clinical data for AMT-130 announced in December 2023 and was based on an analysis comparing these 24-month clinical data to a non-concurrent criteria-matched natural history cohort. 
Updated Interim Data
In July 2024, we announced updated interim clinical data, including up to 24 months of follow-up data from 29 patients enrolled in the U.S. study and the European study as of a March 31, 2024 cut-off date. 
As summary of key observations from the July 2024 interim update is set forth below.
●
A statistically significant, dose-dependent, slowing in disease progression measured by composite Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale (“cUHDRS”) was observed through 24 months in patients receiving the high dose of AMT-130.
●
Trends in measurements of motor and cognitive function showed near-baseline stability throughout the 24 months of follow-up in patients receiving the high dose of AMT-130.
●
A statistically significant reduction of neurofilament light chain (“NfL”) in cerebrospinal fluid (“CSF”) was observed in patients treated with AMT-130.
●
Based on data observed as of the July 2024 update, AMT-130 remained generally well-tolerated, with a manageable safety profile at both high and low doses. There were no new AMT-130-related serious adverse events reported.
Regulatory Alignment 
In December 2024, following our initial Type B meeting, we announced that we had reached agreement with FDA on key elements of an Accelerated Approval pathway for AMT-130. In correspondence leading up to and following the Type B meeting, FDA agreed that data from the ongoing Phase I/II studies of AMT-130, compared to a natural history external control, may serve as the primary basis for a Biologics License Application, (“BLA”), submission under FDA’s accelerated approval pathway. The FDA also agreed that cUHDRS may be used as an intermediate clinical endpoint and that reductions in NfL measured in CSF may serve as supportive evidence of therapeutic benefit in the application for such accelerated approval. 
​
We have initiated BLA-readiness activities and plan to have additional interactions with the FDA to discuss the primary statistical analysis plan and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (“CMC”) requirements for a BLA submission. In addition, we plan to initiate regulatory interactions with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in the first half of 2025.
​
Other clinical candidates
In November 2024, we announced that the that the first patient was dosed in the GenTLE Phase I/IIa clinical trial of AMT-260 for the treatment of refractory mTLE. In addition, the FDA recently approved a protocol amendment expanding the inclusion criteria for certain patients in the first cohort to include patients with non-lesional mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in the non-dominant hemisphere.  
​
In August 2024, we announced that the first patient had been dosed in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial of AMT-191 for the treatment of Fabry disease.

Other Business Developments
Sale of commercial manufacturing activities
​
In June 2024, our affiliates, uniQure Inc. and uniQure biopharma B.V., entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “APA”) with Genezen Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary, Genezen MA, Inc. (together “Genezen”) to sell certain assets and assume certain liabilities related to uniQure’s manufacturing facility and operations in Lexington, Massachusetts (“Lexington Transaction”). The Lexington Transaction closed in July 2024 (“Closing”). In connection with the Closing, Genezen extended offers of employment to a significant majority of our employees located at the Lexington facility and our Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Kapusta, joined the board of directors of Genezen.
​
At the Closing, we entered into a commercial supply agreement (“CSA”) with Genezen for the commercial manufacture of HEMGENIX®. Pursuant to the CSA, Genezen manufactures and supplies CSL Behring’s commercial demand for HEMGENIX® on our behalf. The CSA includes a minimum term of three years and minimum purchase commitments of HEMGENIX® commercial supplies of $43.3 million over the first three years, unless certain contractual provisions are triggered. Our obligations with respect to the supply of HEMGENIX® to CSL Behring remain in effect notwithstanding the subcontracting to Genezen.
​
Additionally, we entered into a development and other manufacturing services agreement (“DMSA”) with Genezen at Closing. Pursuant to the DMSA, we are entitled to preferred customer status to receive manufacturing and development services to support our investigational gene therapy programs and other services related to HEMGENIX® (other than our manufacturing and supply obligations under the CSA). The DMSA has a minimum term of three years and requires us to purchase services for a total minimum of $14.0 million.
​
We recorded a $1.2 million gain from the divestment. We paid a total of $8.3 million to Genezen and CSL related to adjustments of working capital and to obtain consent to proceed with the divestiture. 
​
Organizational restructuring 
​
In August, 2024, we announced a global organizational restructuring (the “Restructuring”).  These actions were the outcome of a comprehensive review of our operations with the goals of conserving capital and streamlining the organization. As a result of the Restructuring and the Lexington Transaction, we eliminated approximately 300 positions or 65% of our workforce. We substantially completed the Restructuring at the end of 2024. We have incurred $5.2 million employee severance costs in the year ended December 31, 2024 and estimate that we will incur additional costs in the range of $0.5 million to $1.0 million in 2025.
​
Hercules loan repayment and amendment
In connection with the July 2024 closing of the Lexington Transaction we and Hercules amended our existing term loan facility whereby we prepaid $50.0 million of the total $100.0 million principal outstanding. The remaining $50.0 million principal outstanding will need to be repaid in January 2027.
Financing
In January 2025, we received net proceeds of $70.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, through a follow-on public offering of 4.4 million ordinary shares at a public offering price of $17.00 per ordinary share. In February 2025, we received an additional $10.6 million in net proceeds upon the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase an additional 0.7 million ordinary shares at the public offering price.

We expect that net proceeds and our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements into the second half of 2027.
​
Our Mission and Strategy
​
Our mission is to deliver curative, one-time administered genomic medicines that transform the lives of patients. We aim to build an industry-leading, fully integrated, and global company that leverages its technology and proprietary manufacturing platform to deliver these medicines to patients with serious unmet medical needs. Our strategy to achieve this mission is to:
Advance the development and commercialization of AMT-130,

a potential one-time gene-therapy approach for the treatment of Huntington’s disease. 
AMT-130 is the first AAV-based gene therapy for the treatment of Huntington’s disease to have entered into clinical development.

In November 2024, we aligned with the FDA on core elements of an Accelerated Approval pathway for AMT-130. In 2025, we intend to further engage with the FDA regarding a potential BLA submission and to initiate discussions with EMA regarding the registrational pathway for AMT-130. We also intend to initiate commercial planning and readiness activities in the U.S. in anticipation of a potential Accelerated Approval. 
Advance our pipeline of clinical-stage gene therapy candidates. 
We have dosed the first patients in the clinical studies of our product candidates

for the treatment of MTLE (AMT-260), SOD1-ALS (AMT-162), and Fabry disease (AMT-191). We intend to complete enrollment and generate clinical data to assess the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of these product candidates.
Develop next-generation delivery and cargo technologies.
 We are developing technologies that have the potential to augment the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and broaden the applicability of our gene therapies to a wider range of diseases and patients. These technologies include next-generation delivery approaches, such as smart AAV capsids potentially capable of improved central nervous system (“CNS”) transduction and crossing the blood-brain barrier, as well as novel cargo technologies such as miQURE, our one-time administered gene silencing platform, linkQURE to combine multiple miRNAs to suppress different genes, and goQURE for simultaneous silencing of a disease gene and replacement with a healthy gene.
​
Central Nervous System Diseases
​
Huntington’s Disease 
Huntington’s Disease 
Huntington’s disease is a severe genetic neurodegenerative disorder causing loss of muscle coordination, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive decline, often resulting in complete physical and mental deterioration over a 12 to 15-year period. The median survival time after onset is 15 to 18 years (range: 5 to >25 years). Huntington’s disease is caused by an inherited defect in a single gene that codes for a protein called Huntingtin (“HTT”). The estimated prevalence of Huntington’s disease is three to seven per 100,000 in the general population, similar in men and women, and it is therefore considered a rare disease. Huntington’s disease mutation carriers can be identified decades before onset. There is currently no available therapy that can delay onset or slow progression of the disease. Although some symptomatic treatments are available, they only are transiently effective despite significant side effects.
Our Development of AMT-130 for Huntington’s Disease

AMT-130 is our novel gene therapy candidate for the treatment of Huntington’s disease, which utilizes our proprietary, gene-silencing miQURE platform and incorporates an AAV vector carrying a micro ribonucleic acid (“miRNA”), specifically designed to silence the huntingtin gene and the potentially highly toxic exon 1 protein fragment.

​

Table of Contents
Our goal for AMT-130 is to develop a gene therapy with the following profile:
(1)
one-time administration of disease-modifying therapy into the striatum, the area of the brain where Huntington’s disease is known to manifest;
(2)
biodistribution of the therapy in both the deep and cortical structures of the brain via transport of the AAV vector and through secondary exosome-mediated delivery; and 
(3)
safe, on-target and durable knockdown of HTT and exon 1 HTT.
​
We are currently conducting a multi-center randomized, controlled Phase I/II clinical trial for AMT-130 in the United States (“U.S. study”), as well as an open-label Phase Ib/II study in Europe (“European study”) with the same early-manifest criteria for Huntington’s disease as the U.S. study. 
We completed the enrollment of all 26 patients in the first two cohorts of the U.S. study in March 2022 and the enrollment of 13 patients in the two cohorts of the European study in June 2023. In the U.S. study, 26 patients with early manifest Huntington’s disease were randomized to treatment (six low-dose patients, 10 high-dose patients) or an imitation (sham) surgical procedure (10 patients). The U.S. study consists of a blinded 12-month core patient study period followed by an unblinded long-term follow-up period of five years. Four imitation surgery patients from the U.S. study crossed over to treatment (“Crossover patients”). In the European study, 13 patients were enrolled and treated with AMT-130 (six low-dose patients and seven high-dose patients). 
As of February 2025, we have enrolled 12 patients across the U.S. and the U.K. into a third cohort to further investigate both doses of AMT-130 together with perioperative immunosuppression using the current, established stereotactic administration procedure. The focus of this third cohort is to evaluate the near-term safety and tolerability. 
In July 2024, we announced updated interim clinical data including up to 24 months of follow-up data from 29 patients enrolled in the U.S. study and the European study as of a March 31, 2024 cut-off date. In conjunction with the July 2024 update, we conducted a post-hoc statistical analysis of clinical outcomes for the 21 treated patients at 24 months compared to a propensity-weighted external control developed in collaboration with the Cure Huntington’s Disease Initiative using data from the TRACK-HD, TRACK-ON and PREDICT-HD natural history studies. The external control includes 154 patients that met the Phase I/II clinical trial eligibility criteria and whose data contributions were statistically weighted using propensity scoring to closely match the baseline characteristics of patients treated with AMT-130. Disease-related outcomes for these well-balanced cohorts were then compared after 24 months follow-up. Measures of statistical significance in this analysis were based on nominal p values and are unadjusted.
A summary of key observations related to efficacy from the July 2024 interim update is set forth below:
●
A statistically significant, dose-dependent, slowing in disease progression measured by cUHDRS was observed through 24 months in patients receiving the high dose of AMT-130.
o
At 24 months, the mean change in cUHDRS for patients receiving the high-dose of AMT-130 was -0.2 compared to -1.0 for patients in the propensity score-weighted external control, representing an 80% slowing of disease progression (p=0.007);
o
At 24 months, the mean change in cUHDRS for patients receiving the low-dose of AMT-130 was -0.7 compared to -1.0 for patients in the propensity score-weighted external control, representing a 30% slowing of disease progression (p=0.21);
o
cUHDRS has been demonstrated to be the most sensitive measurement of clinical progression in Huntington’s disease patients.
●
Trends in measurements of motor and cognitive function showed near-baseline stability throughout the 24 months of follow-up in patients receiving the high dose of AMT-130.
●
A statistically significant reduction of NfL in CSF was observed in patients treated with AMT-130.
o
Patients treated with AMT-130 had a mean reduction in CSF NfL of 11% compared to baseline (p=0.02) at 24 months;

o
Mean CSF NfL levels for both high and low doses were below baseline at 24 months;
o
CSF NfL is a well-characterized biomarker of neurodegeneration that has been shown to be strongly associated with the clinical severity of Huntington’s disease. An independent natural history study demonstrated a 26% increase in CSF NfL at 24 months in 19 patients with early manifest Huntington’s disease.
Safety and tolerability
We believe AMT-130 was generally well-tolerated, with a manageable safety profile in patients treated with the lower dose of 6x10
12
 vector genomes and the higher dose of 6x10
13
 vector genomes. The most common adverse events in the treatment groups were related to the surgical procedure. 
There were four serious adverse events (SAE) unrelated to AMT-130 (post-operative delirium, major depression, suicidal ideation and epistaxis) in the low-dose cohort, six unrelated SAEs in the high-dose cohort (back pain, hypothermia, post procedural hematoma, post-lumbar puncture syndrome (n=2), pulmonary embolism), and one SAE (deep vein thrombosis) in the control group. In addition, there were four AMT-130-related SAEs in the high-dose cohort (central nervous system inflammation (n=3), and severe headache (n=1) that, retrospectively, also was attributable to central nervous system inflammation.
Patients with symptomatic central nervous system inflammation improved with glucocorticoid medication. Additionally, six high-dose patients have received preoperative steroids with the administration of AMT-130 to reduce the risk of inflammation.
Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Program (AMT-260)
Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Disease and Market Background
TLE affects approximately 1.0 million people in the U.S. and E.U. alone, of which approximately 0.3 million U.S. patients are inadequately treated through anti-seizure medications and are considered refractory. 240,000 of U.S. refractory TLE patients have a lesion in the mesial temporal lobe (hippocampus), which is expressed as sclerosis, atrophy or scarring. Mesial TLE (“MTLE”) is often caused by brain injury, infections or prolonged febrile seizures which can lead to hyperexcitability of the hippocampus and repeated seizures which can further damage the hippocampus over time. Refractory MTLE patients have a poor quality of life and a reduced lifespan.

Surgical treatment for refractory patients is lobectomy or laser tissue ablation but only 1-2% of eligible patients undergo surgery.
​
Our Development of AMT-260 for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy
In July 2021, we acquired uniQure France SAS (“uniQure France,” formerly Corlieve Therapeutics SAS) and its lead program now known as AMT-260 to treat refractory MTLE. AMT-260 is being developed based on exclusive licenses to certain patents uniQure France SAS obtained following its formation in 2019 from two French research institutions. 
​
AMT-260 is comprised of an AAV9 vector that locally delivers two engineered miRNAs designed to degrade the GRIK2 gene and suppress the aberrant expression of glutamate receptor subtype GLUK2 that is believed to trigger seizures in patients with refractory mTLE. The use of AAV9 to deliver any sequence that affects the expression of the GRIK2 gene in humans has been exclusively licensed from Regenxbio Inc (“Regenxbio”).
​
In September 2023 we announced that the FDA had cleared the IND application for AMT-260.
​
We initiated a Phase I/IIa clinical trial that is being conducted in the United States and consist of two parts. The first part is a multicenter, open-label trial with two dosing cohorts of six patients each to assess safety, tolerability, and first signs for efficacy of AMT-260 in patients with refractory mTLE. The second part is expected to be a randomized, controlled trial to generate proof of concept data. The FDA-approved study protocol provides that the first three patients to be enrolled in the study are required to have MRI-confirmed unilateral, hippocampal sclerosis.

​
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (“ALS”) 
ALS Disease and Market Background
ALS commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a progressive and fatal neuromuscular disease with the majority of ALS patients dying within 2 to 5 years of receiving a diagnosis. Familial ALS, a hereditary form of the disease, accounts for 5-10% of cases, whereas the remaining cases (sporadic ALS) have no clearly defined etiology. ALS affects persons of all races and ethnicities; however, persons of certain demographics (Caucasians, males, non-Hispanics and persons aged 60 years or older) and those with a family history of ALS are more likely to develop the disease.
ALS affects approximately 17,800 to 31,800 adults in the U.S. and a similar number of adults in Europe. Evidence from prevalence studies suggests that prevalence and incident rates can vary significantly between regions and ethnicities. Most cases are sporadic (“sALS”) but approximately 10% are found to have a familial, i.e., dominant genetic causation (“fALS”). fALS can be caused by mutations in various genes including chromosome 9 open reading frame 72, SOD1, tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 and others. 
One genetic mutation that causes ALS are pathogenic mutations in the superoxide dismutase enzyme 1(“SOD1”). SOD1 is an enzyme that that is responsible for catalyzing toxic superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and dioxygen. While the exact mechanism for disease is not known, it is believed that a toxic gain of function in SOD1 results in oxidative stress and cell death of motor neurons. More than 100 pathogenic SOD-1 have been identified. Mutations are concentrated in a few regions of the protein. Mutations can be both dominant and recessive. Most common mutations occur in the D90A, G93A, A4H and D46R genes. 
Patients with different mutations progress at different rates. It is estimated that there are approximately 300 incident cases per year in the U.S. and Europe.
Our Development of AMT-162 for ALS – SOD1
In January 2023 we announced that we entered into a global licensing agreement with Apic Bio for a novel, one-time, intrathecally administered gene therapy for ALS caused by SOD1 mutations (formerly APB-102). The FDA has cleared the IND for APB-102 and has granted it Orphan Drug and Fast Track designation. APB-102 is comprised of a recombinant AAVrh10 vector that expresses a miRNA designed to knock down the expression of SOD1 with the goal of slowing down or potentially reversing the progression of ALS in patients with SOD1 mutations. The FDA has cleared the IND application for AMT-162 and has granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track Designation.
In October 2024, we announced the first patient had been dosed in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial of AMT-162 (“EPISOD1”) for the treatment of SOD1-ALS. In January 2025, we announced that the independent data monitoring committee had recommended to proceed with enrollment of the second cohort after a review of the 28-day safety data from the first cohort. 
​
EPISOD1 is a Phase I/II multi-center, open-label trial of AMT-162 for the treatment of SOD1-ALS being conducted in the United States consisting of three dose-escalating cohorts with up to four patients each receiving a short course of immunosuppression prior to and after an intrathecal infusion of AMT-162. The trial will explore the safety and tolerability of AMT-162 and will assess exploratory signs of efficacy by measuring neurofilament light chain, a biomarker of neuronal damage, and SOD1 protein. Additional details are available on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT06100276).

Liver-directed diseases
​
Hemophilia B (HEMGENIX® or etranacogene dezaparvovec)
Hemophilia B Disease and Market Background
Hemophilia B is a rare, lifelong bleeding disorder caused by a single gene defect, resulting in insufficient production of factor IX, a protein primarily produced by the liver that helps blood clots form. Treatments for moderate to severe hemophilia B include prophylactic infusions of factor IX replacement therapy to temporarily replace or supplement low levels of blood-clotting factor and, while these therapies are effective, those with hemophilia B must adhere to strict, lifelong infusion schedules. They may also still experience spontaneous bleeding episodes as well as limited mobility, joint damage or severe pain as a result of the disease. For appropriate patients, HEMGENIX® allows people living with hemophilia B to produce their own factor IX, which can lower the risk of bleeding.
CSL Behring collaboration
In June 2020, we entered into the CSL Behring Agreement pursuant to which CSL Behring received exclusive global rights to HEMGENIX®. The transaction became fully effective in May 2021. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the CSL Behring Agreement will continue on a country-by-country basis until expiration of the royalty term in a country. The royalty term expires in a country on the later of (a) 15 years after the first commercial sale of the Product in such country, (b) expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the Product in such country and (c) expiration of all valid claims of specific licensed patents covering the Product in such country. Either we or CSL Behring may terminate the CSL Behring Agreement for the other party’s material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified cure period. In addition, if CSL Behring fails to commercialize the Product in any of a group of major countries for an extended period of time following the first regulatory approval of the Product in any of such group of countries (other than due to certain specified reasons) and such failure has not been cured within a specified cure period, then we may terminate the CSL Behring Agreement. CSL Behring may also terminate the CSL Behring Agreement for convenience. 
We and CSL Behring also entered into a development and commercial supply agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, we will supply the Product to CSL Behring. We are contractually obligated to supply the Product until such time that these capabilities are transferred to CSL Behring or its designated contract manufacturing organization. On September 6, 2022, CSL Behring notified us of its intent to transfer manufacturing technology in the coming years related to HEMGENIX® to a third-party contract manufacturer designated by CSL Behring.
Fabry disease program (AMT-191)
Fabry Disease and Market Background
Fabry disease is a progressive, inherited, multisystemic lysosomal storage disease characterized by specific neurological, cutaneous, renal, cardiovascular, cochleo-vestibular, and cerebrovascular manifestations. Fabry disease is caused by a defect in a gene that encodes for a protein called α-galactosidase A (“GLA”). The GLA protein is an essential enzyme required to breakdown globotriaosylsphingosine (“Gb3”) and lyso-globotriaosylsphingosine (“lyso-Gb3”). In patients living with Fabry disease, Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 accumulate in various cells throughout the body causing progressive clinical signs and symptoms of the disease. Current treatment options, which consist of bi-weekly intravenous enzyme replacement therapy, typically have no therapeutic benefit in patients with advanced renal or cardiac disease. Studies have also shown that a majority of male patients develop antibodies that inhibit the GLA protein and interfere with therapeutic efficacy.
13
​

Table of Contents
Fabry disease has two major disease phenotypes: the type 1 “classic” and type 2 “later-onset” subtypes. Both lead to renal failure, and/or cardiac disease, and early death. Type 1 males have little or no functional a-Gal A enzymatic activity (<1% of normal mean) and marked accumulation of GL-3/Gb3 and related glycolipids in capillaries and small blood vessels which cause the major symptoms in childhood or adolescence. In contrast, males with the type 2 “later-onset” phenotype (previously called cardiac or renal variants) have residual a-Gal A activity, lack GL-3/Gb3 accumulation in capillaries and small blood vessels, and do not manifest the early manifestations of type 1 males. They experience an essentially normal childhood and adolescence. They typically present with renal and/or cardiac disease in the third to seventh decades of life. Most type 2 later-onset patients have been identified by enzyme screening of patients in cardiac, hemodialysis, renal transplant, and stroke clinics and recently by newborn screening. Fabry disease occurs in all racial and ethnic populations and affects males and females. It is estimated that type 1 classic Fabry disease affects approximately one in 40,000 males and approximately one in 20,000 females. The type 2 later-onset phenotype is more frequent, and in some populations may occur as frequently as about 1 in 1,500 to 4,000 males.
Our Development of AMT-191 for Fabry Disease
AMT-191 is our investigational gene therapy candidate for the treatment of Fabry disease. AMT-191 is comprised of an AAV5 capsid that incorporates the α-galactosidase A (GLA) transgene and a proprietary, highly potent, liver-specific promoter. In November 2023 we announced that FDA had cleared the investigation new drug application (“IND”) for AMT-191. We are conducting a Phase I/IIa clinical trial in the United States. The multicenter, open-label clinical trial consists of two dose-escalating cohorts of three patients each to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of AMT-191 in patients with Fabry disease. Three patients will be dosed in the initial dose. If no dose-limiting toxicology is identified, the dose will be escalated. If dose-limiting toxicology occurs in one of the three initial patients, three additional patients will be enrolled at the same dose level. If no additional patients in the cohort experience a dose-limiting toxicology, the dose will be escalated. Assessments will be made at three- and six-months post-treatment.  
In August 2024, we announced that the first patient has been dosed in a Phase I/IIa clinical trial of AMT-191 for the treatment of Fabry disease. 
​
In September 2024, we announced the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to AMT-191 and in October 2024, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to AMT-191.
​
In February 2025, we announced the completion of enrollment in the first cohort of the Phase I/IIa trial. Additionally, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee reviewed safety data from the initial two patients enrolled in the first cohort. The IDMC’s review did not identify any significant safety concerns and recommended proceeding with enrollment in the second cohort.
​
New Technology Development
​
We are seeking to develop next-generation technologies with the goal of further improving the potential of AAV-based gene therapies to treat patients suffering from debilitating diseases. We are focused on innovative technologies across each of the key components of an AAV-based gene therapy, including: (i) the capsid, or the outer viral protein shell that encloses the target deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”); (ii) the cargo, including the transgene or therapeutic gene, and promoters, or the DNA sequence that drives the expression of the transgene; and (iii) administration techniques. 
We dedicate significant effort to designing and screening novel AAV capsids with the potential for (i) higher biological potency; (ii) improved biodistribution including greater cell transduction and increased cellular specificity; (iii) enhanced safety; and (iv) manufacturing efficiency. We believe we have significant expertise in vector engineering and have created promising genetically engineered capsids using both rational and directed evolution approaches.

Table of Contents
We have also demonstrated the ability to deliver engineered DNA constructs that can silence or suppress disease-causing genes. Our miQURE gene silencing platform, based on exclusively licensed technology from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (“CSHL”), is designed to degrade mutated genes without off-target toxicity and induce silencing of the mutated gene in the entire target organ through secondary exosome-mediated delivery. miQURE-based gene therapy candidates, such as AMT-130, incorporate proprietary, therapeutic miRNA constructs that can be delivered using AAVs to potentially provide long-lasting activity. Preclinical studies of miQURE-based gene therapies have demonstrated several important advantages, including enhanced tissue-specificity, improved nuclear and cytoplasmic gene lowering and no off-target effects associated with impact to the cellular miRNA or messenger RNA transcriptome.

The existing miQURE gene silencing strategy was expanded by linking several miRNA molecules in a single construct, resulting in the new linQURE platform.
​
Our

Intellectual Property
​
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including by seeking and maintaining patent protection in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions for novel components of our gene therapies, the chemistries of and processes for manufacturing these gene therapies, the use of these components in gene therapies, our technology platform, and other inventions and related technology. We also rely on trade secrets, security measures and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
​
We expect that our probability of success will be significantly enhanced by our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of AAV-based gene therapies.
​
In some cases, we are dependent on the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to develop and commercialize our products. We must obtain licenses from such third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. For example, we license from third parties essential parts of the therapeutic gene cassettes as well as the principal AAV vectors we use and key elements of our manufacturing process. We anticipate that we will require licenses to additional technology in the future.
​
Because most patent applications throughout the world are confidential for 18 months after the earliest claimed priority date, and since the publication of discoveries in the scientific and patent literature often lags actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent or file applications for the inventions covered by our pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in post-grant proceedings in the patent offices of the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, such as oppositions, reexaminations, or interferences, in which the patentability or priority of our inventions are challenged. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see Item 1A.,

Patent Portfolio
​
Our gene therapy programs are protected by patents and patent applications directed to various aspects of our technology. For example, our gene therapy programs are protected by patents and patent applications with composition of matter or method of use claims that cover the therapeutic gene, the promoter, the viral vector capsid, or other specific parts of these technologies. We also seek protection of core aspects of our manufacturing process, particularly regarding our baculovirus expression system for AAV vectors in insect cells. In addition, we have filed manufacturing patent applications with claims directed to alternative compositions of matter and manufacturing processes to seek better protection from competitors.

We file the initial patent applications for our commercially important technologies in Europe and/or the U.S. For the same technologies, we typically file international patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) within one year. After the PCT phase, we file patent applications in Europe (EPO) or the U.S., as applicable based on the jurisdiction in which we file the first patent application. We also may seek, usually on a case-by-case basis, local patent protection in Canada, Australia, Japan, China, India, Israel, South Africa, New Zealand, South Korea, and Eurasia, as well as South American jurisdictions such as Brazil and Mexico. During prosecution of the patent applications, we may file divisional applications at the EPO or divisionals or continuations in the U.S. prior to the grant or issue of the patent. For patent families which are considered particularly important, we may also file divisional applications in other jurisdictions.
​
As of December 31, 2024, our fully owned intellectual property portfolio included 128 issued patents (including 27 U.S. patents and 15 patents granted by the European Patent Office (“EPO”)) and 127 (published) pending patent applications (including 27 U.S. patent applications and 27 patent applications pending at the EPO).  These patents relate to a variety of technologies including our product candidates that are in development as well as to our manufacturing and technology platforms.
​
We own three published patent families directed to gene therapy treatment of Huntington’s disease, including AMT-130 and its formulation. AMT-130 is a miQURE®-based gene-transcript silencing technology designed to degrade disease-causing gene transcripts without off-target toxicity while inducing silencing throughout the entire target organ through secondary exosome-mediated delivery. We co-own two patent families, and fully own one patent family, directed to gene therapy-mediated treatment of TLE, including our product candidate AMT-260. Of the two co-owned patent families, the co-owners have exclusively licensed their rights to us. Additionally, we are the exclusive licensee to two other patent families directed to the Gluk2/Gluk5 antagonists and their use in TLE. We have obtained an exclusive license to two patent families directed to gene therapy treatment of ALS, including our product candidate AMT-162. We own a patent family directed to potent liver-specific promoters, including the promoter present in our product candidate AMT-191. Additionally, we own a patent family directed to the formulation of AMT-191 for intravenous infusion.
​
​
Licenses
​
We have obtained exclusive or non-exclusive rights from third parties under a range of patents and other technology that we use in our product and development programs, as described below. Our agreements with these third parties generally grant us a license to make, use, sell, offer to sell, and import products covered by the licensed patent rights in exchange for our payment of some combination of an upfront amount, annual fees, royalties, a percentage of amounts we receive from our licensees and payments upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Some of the agreements specify the extent of the efforts we must use to develop and commercialize licensed products. The agreements generally expire upon expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents. Each licensor may terminate the applicable agreement if we materially breach our obligations and fail to cure the breach within a specified cure period.
​
Licensed Technology Used for Multiple Programs
​
We are exploiting technology from third-party sources described below in more than one of our programs.
​
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
​
In 2015, we entered into a license agreement with CSHL in which CSHL granted to us an exclusive, sublicensable license to develop and commercialize certain of CSHL’s patented RNAi-related technology for use in connection with the treatment or prevention of Huntington’s disease. We expanded the scope of the license agreement with CSHL in 2018 beyond Huntington’s disease to include the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of all CNS diseases in the field. Under the amended license agreement CSHL granted to us an exclusive license to develop and commercialize therapeutic products for the additional disease classifications in the field of liver diseases, neuromuscular diseases, and cardiovascular diseases, and we have subsequently added such products to our pipeline.

Under this license agreement, as amended, annual fees, development milestone payments and future single-digit royalties on net sales of a licensed product are payable to CSHL. The standard 20-year patent term for the licensed patents expires in 2031.
​
Protein Sciences
​
In 2016, we revised our existing license contract with Protein Sciences Corporation for the use of its 
expresSF
+ insect cell line and associated technology for human therapeutic and prophylactic uses (except influenza) to provide us with a royalty free, perpetual right and license to the technology in the field of AAV-based gene therapy.
​
Technology Used for Specific Development Programs
​
Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (AMT-260)
​
Regenxbio 
​
In June 2020, uniQure France SAS entered into an agreement, subsequently amended in June 2021, with Regenxbio for an exclusive (in the field of using AAV9 to expression of the 
GRIK2
 gene in humans (the “Field”)), sublicensable, royalty-bearing, worldwide license under Regenxbio’s interest in EU patent application 19185533.7 (the “Foreground Patents”) and related patents, as well as patents covering inventions developed during the collaboration and certain patents and know-how relating to AAV9. The license also includes non-exclusive rights to exploit the licensed Foreground Patents and certain related patents know-how developed in collaboration pursuant to the license agreement outside the Field. The license also includes retained and license back rights that permit Regenxbio and its upstream licensors to exploit for any research, development, commercialization, or other purposes certain patents, inventions and know-how (other than the Foreground Patents) subject to or created pursuant to the license agreement.
​
Payment obligations under the agreement provide for royalty payments on net sales in the mid-single digit to low-double digits, and milestone payments to Regenxbio in the mid-tens of millions of dollars related to clinical trials, commercialization, and net sales. The agreement also calls for sublicense fees in the low-double digit range. The royalty is paid on sales of license products using any of licensed patents or know-how for as long as the agreement is in effect. Royalty and milestone payments may continue to be owed under the license following termination of the agreement if licensed products are sold following termination of the license. Under the agreement, uniQure France SAS has certain diligence obligations and Regenxbio has certain obligations related to the pre-clinical development of manufacturing technology.
​
Inserm Transfert
​
In January 2020, uniQure France SAS entered into license agreement with Inserm Transfert SA (also acting as a delegate for the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research) and La societe SATT Aquitaine (the counterparties collectively referred to as “Inserm Transfert”). Under the license agreement, uniQure France SAS is granted an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing, worldwide license under European Patent (“EP”) patent application 13306265.3 in the field of the prevention and treatment of epilepsy, and in Inserm Transfert’s share in EP patent application 19185533.7 (which is co-owned by Regenxbio) in the field of all human use. uniQure France SAS also is granted a non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing, worldwide license under certain know-how in the fields that may be developed by Inserm pursuant to the agreements. Under the agreements, Inserm retains certain rights for teaching, academic and/or research purposes.
​
Payment obligations under the agreements include a royalty on the net sales of license products in the low single digits, milestone payments associated with clinical trial and regulatory approval milestones of multiple licensed products totaling in the low-single digit millions of Euros. The agreement also calls for sublicense fees in the low to mid double-digit range depending on the timing of such sublicense. The obligation to pay royalties extends until the later of the expiration of the patent rights, any regulatory exclusivity period, and 10 years from the first commercial sale of a licensed product.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (AMT-162)
​
In January 2023, we announced that we had entered into a global licensing agreement with Apic Bio for a one-time, intrathecally administered investigational gene therapy for ALS caused by mutations in SOD-1, pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive global license (including a sublicense of rights granted to Apic Bio pursuant to an exclusive license agreement with a certain U.S.-based academic institution) to Apic Bio’s rights under certain licensed technology to develop, manufacture, and commercialize any product incorporating a licensed construct (including APB-102, certain constructs expressing a SOD1-targeting microRNA or AAV that codes for a microRNA that silences SOD1 expression), in any dosage strength, formulation, concentration or method of delivery in the applicable field. We made an initial cash payment of $10.0 million to Apic Bio. In addition, we will pay Apic Bio up to $43.0 million in milestones upon achievement of regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe and pre-specified annual net sales, and a tiered royalty on net sales ranging from the mid-single digits to low double digits.
Trade Secrets
​
In addition to patents and licenses, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of the process by which we manufacture our gene therapies are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes and obtain and maintain ownership of certain technologies, in part, through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial collaborator. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
​
Trademarks
​
We have a number of material registered trademarks, including “uniQure”, that we have registered in various jurisdictions including the U.S. and the EU. We may seek trademark protection for other product candidates and technologies as and when appropriate.
​
Competition
​
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the gene therapy field, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic and other research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions that are developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products that may be competitive with ours.
​
Our key competitors focused on developing therapies in various indications, include among others, PTC Therapeutics, Roche, Wave Life Sciences, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Skyhawk Therapeutics (for Huntington’s disease), Neurona Therapeutics and CombiGene (for TLE), Biogen, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Neurimmune, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Voyager Therapeutics (for ALS) and Amicus Therapeutics, Sanofi, Takeda, Chiesi, Idorsia, Sangamo Therapeutics, 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Skyline Pharmaceuticals and CANbridge (for Fabry disease). 
​
We also compete with existing standards of care, therapies, and symptomatic treatments, as well as any new therapies and novel technologies, that may become available in the future for the indications we are targeting.
​
Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials regulatory affairs, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
​
​

​

Table of Contents
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. We also believe that, due to the small size of the patient populations in the orphan indications we target, being first to market will be a significant competitive advantage. We believe that our advantages in vector and manufacturing technology will enable us to reach market in a number of indications ahead of our competitors, and to potentially capture the markets in these indications either by being first or in those markets with larger populations having a differentiated product.
​
​
Government Regulation and Reimbursement
​
Government authorities in the U.S., EU and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the approval, research, development, nonclinical and clinical testing, manufacture (including any manufacturing changes), packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, reimbursement, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, biological products, and medical devices. We believe that all our product candidates will be regulated as biological products, or biologics, and in particular, as gene therapies, and will be subject to such requirements and regulations under U.S. and foreign laws. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, civil penalties, refusal to approve pending applications, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.
​
Regulation in the United States
​
In the U.S., the FDA regulates biologics under the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. These laws and regulatory guidance are continually evolving. By example, various actions have been taken by the U.S. Congress and President over recent years with respect to drug shortage prevention and reporting, supply chain security, and the promotion of U.S. domestic manufacturing. The FDA also continually issues nonbinding guidance documents that provide the FDA’s interpretation of its laws and regulations, as well as the FDA’s approach to scientific issues and questions.
​
Obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with applicable statutes and regulatory requirements entails the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources, including payment of user fees for applications to the FDA. All our current product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the U.S. must typically undertake the following:
​
●
completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
●
submission to the FDA of an IND application which allows human clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days; the sponsor of an IND or its legal representative must be based in the U.S.;
●
approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) and, for some studies, Institutional Biosafety Committee (“IBC”) before each clinical trial may be initiated;
●
performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s cGCP to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy for the proposed biological product for each indication;
●
preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”);
●
satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections or remote regulatory assessments of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity, as well as selected clinical trial sites and investigators to determine cGCP compliance;
●
approval of the BLA by the FDA, in consultation with an FDA advisory committee, if deemed appropriate by the FDA; and
●
compliance with any post-approval commitments, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”), and post-approval studies required by the FDA.

Human Clinical Studies in the United States under an IND
​
Before initiating clinical studies in the U.S. or under an IND, investigational product sponsors must first complete nonclinical studies. Nonclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity, and product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Such studies must generally be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s GLPs.
​
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current GCP requirements, which includes requirements for informed consent, study conduct, and IRB review and approval. Special clinical trial ethical considerations also must be considered if a study involves children. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Sponsors will be required to provide the FDA with diversity action plans. INDs include nonclinical study reports, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data, or literature, and proposed clinical study protocols among other things. A clinical trial may not proceed in the U.S. unless and until an IND becomes effective, which is 30 days after its receipt by the FDA. The FDA may raise concerns or questions related to one or more components of an IND and place the IND on clinical hold if during its review the FDA determines that study subjects would be exposed to significant risk of illness or injury. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
​
The protocol and informed consent documents, as well as other subject communications must also be approved by an IRB that continues to oversee that trial. In the case of gene therapy studies, an IBC at the local level may also review and maintain oversight over the particular study, in addition to the IRB. The FDA, an IRB, and IBC, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that research requirements are not being met. 
​
Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor that regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of the trial. This group may also review interim data to assess the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. This group receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise the sponsor to halt, pause, or otherwise modify the clinical trial.
​
Information about certain clinical trials, including results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for listing on the ClinicalTrials.gov website. Sponsors or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA.
​
Subsequent clinical protocols and amendments must also be submitted to an active IND but are not subject to the 30-day review period imposed on an original IND. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must also be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events or other significant safety information is found. There is a risk that once a new protocol or amendment is submitted to an active IND there may be an extended period before the FDA may comment or provide feedback. This may result in a need to modify an ongoing clinical trial to incorporate this feedback or even a clinical hold of the trial. There is also risk that FDA may not provide comments or feedback but may ultimately disagree with the design of the study once a BLA is submitted.
​
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
​
●
Phase I: The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness.
●
Phase II: The biological product is administered to a limited patient population to further identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
20
​

Table of Contents
●
Phase III: The biological product is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labelling of the product. Typically, two Phase III trials are required by the FDA for product approval. Under some limited circumstances, however, the FDA may approve a BLA based upon a single Phase III clinical study plus confirmatory evidence or a single large multicenter trial without confirmatory evidence.
​
Recent legislation further established a new program that may be used to facilitate future marketing applications and development programs following a first product approval. Specifically, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 established a program whereby a platform technology that is incorporated within or utilized by an approved drug or biologic product may be designated as a platform technology, provided that certain conditions are met, in which case development and approval of subsequent products using such technology may be expedited.

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (the “PREA”), a BLA or BLA supplement for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration, must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Orphan products are also exempt from the PREA requirements.
The manufacture of investigational drugs and biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and biologics and active ingredients and therapeutic substances imported into the U.S. are also subject to regulation by the FDA. Further, the export of investigational products outside of the U.S. is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional nonclinical animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, manufacturers must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Regulation and FDA Guidance Governing Gene Therapy Products
​
The FDA has and continues to issue various guidance documents with respect to the development and commercialization of gene therapies. These include guidance on, among other things, the proper preclinical and nonclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls; the design and conduct of clinical trials and product development; the design and analysis of shedding studies for virus or bacteria based gene therapies; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects and patients who have been exposed to gene therapies via long-term follow-up with associated regulatory reporting. The FDA has also issued guidance on the development of gene therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, rare diseases, and hemophilia, as such products may face special challenges.
​
Certain

gene therapy studies are also subject to the National Institutes of Health’s Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, (“NIH Guidelines”). The NIH Guidelines include the review of the study by an IBC. The IBC assesses the compliance of the research with the NIH Guidelines, assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.

​

Table of Contents
Compliance with cGMP Requirements
​
Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and provide the FDA a list of products manufactured at the facilities. Recently, the information that must be submitted to the FDA regarding manufactured products was expanded through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act to include the volume of drugs produced during the prior year. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections and remote regulatory assessments by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Discovery of non-compliance may result in the FDA placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market, recall, shutdown, enforcement letters, among other consequences. Noncompliance with the applicable manufacturing requirements may also require costly corrective and preventative actions. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are following cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
​
FDA Programs to Expedite Product Development
​
The FDA has several programs to expedite product development, including fast track designation and breakthrough therapy designation. These are outlined in specific FDA guidance. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a biologic candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the product candidate. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine that a product candidate is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. This may be demonstrated by clinical or nonclinical data. If granted, the benefits include greater interactions with the FDA and potentially rolling review of sections of the BLA. In some cases, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval or priority review.
​
Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Products designated as breakthrough therapies are potentially eligible for rolling review, as well as intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase I trials, and a commitment from the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative, cross disciplinary review.
​
Biologics studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means the FDA may approve the product based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. A biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. By the date of approval of an accelerated approval product, FDA must specify the conditions for the required post approval studies, including enrollment targets, the study protocol, milestones, and target completion dates. FDA may also require, and frequently does require, that the confirmatory Phase 4 studies be commenced prior to FDA granting a product accelerated approval. Reports on the progress of the required Phase 4 confirmatory studies must be submitted to FDA every 180 days after approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug or biologic from the market on an expedited basis using a statutorily defined streamlined process. Failure to conduct the required Phase 4 confirmatory studies or to conduct such studies with due diligence, as well as failure to submit the required update reports can subject a sponsor to penalties. All promotional materials for drug or biologic candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. In recent years, the accelerated approval pathway has come under significant FDA and public scrutiny. Accordingly, the FDA may be more conservative in granting accelerated approval or, if granted, may be more apt to withdrawal approval if clinical benefit is not confirmed. 
​
22
​

Table of Contents
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
​
Submission of a BLA
​
The results of the nonclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting a license to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of a BLA is subject to an application user fee, though products with orphan designation are exempt from the BLA filing fee. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual program user fees. Orphan products may also be exempt from program fees provided that certain criteria are met. These fees are typically increased annually. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) the FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs.
​
Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the filing acceptance date (typically 60 days after date of filing), and most applications for priority review products are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing acceptance date (typically 60 days after date of filing). Priority review designation may be assigned to product candidates that are intended to treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of the serious condition. 
​
The FDA may refuse to file an application and request additional information. In this event, the application must be refiled with the additional information. The refiled application is also subject to assessment of content before the FDA accepts it for review. Once the submission is accepted, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA will assign a date for its final decision for the product (the “PDUFA action date”) but can extend this date to complete review of a product application or to consider additional information submitted during the application review period. The PDUFA action date is only a goal, thus, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. 
​
The FDA may also refer certain applications to an advisory committee. Before approving a product candidate for which no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of active ingredients) has previously been approved by the FDA, the FDA must either refer that product candidate to an external advisory committee or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why the FDA did not refer the product candidate to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer other product candidates to an advisory committee if the FDA believes that the advisory committee’s expertise would be beneficial. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, which review, evaluate, and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product candidate meets the agency’s approval standards and whether the manufacturing methods and controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity. Before approving a marketing application, the FDA typically will inspect or conduct remote regulatory assessments of the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and subcontractors, are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a marketing application the FDA will inspect or conduct remote regulatory assessments of one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”).
After evaluating the marketing application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection and remote regulatory inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biological product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Many drug applications receive complete response letters from the FDA during their first cycle of FDA review.

If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product; require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling, including boxed warnings; require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials and trials to ensure that population representative data is collected, be conducted to further assess a biologic’s efficacy and safety after approval; or require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. The FDA may also not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing.
​
In addition to the above conditions of approval, the FDA also may require submission of a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the product candidate outweigh the risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. An assessment of the REMS must also be conducted at set intervals. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered, and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks. In guidance, FDA stated that during the review of a BLA for a gene therapy, it will assess whether a REMS is necessary. Several gene therapy products that have been approved by FDA have required substantial REMS, which included requirements for dispensing hospital and clinic certification, training, adverse event reporting, documentation, and regulatory audits and monitoring conducted by the sponsor, among other conditions. REMS, such as these, can be expensive and burdensome to implement, and burdensome for hospitals, clinics, and healthcare providers to comply with.
​
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
​
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”) which amended the PHSA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars under Section 351(k) of the PHSA. Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may apply for licensure of a biologic product that is biosimilar to or interchangeable with a previously approved biological product or reference product. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that it is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in safety, purity or potency. A finding of interchangeability requires that a product is determined to be biosimilar to the reference product, and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
​
An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following approval of the reference product, and it may not be approved until 12 years following approval of the reference product. These exclusivity provisions only apply to biosimilar companies and not companies that rely on their own data and file a full BLA. Moreover, this exclusivity is not without limitation. Certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the twelve-year exclusivity period. Further, the twelve-year exclusivity period in the U.S. for biologics has been controversial and may be shortened in the future.
The PHSA also includes provisions to protect reference products that have patent protection. The biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may exchange certain patent and product information for the purpose of determining whether there should be a legal patent challenge. Based on the outcome of negotiations surrounding the exchanged information, the reference product sponsor may bring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings against the biosimilar product sponsor. The biosimilar applicant may also be able to bring an action for declaratory judgment concerning the patent.
The FDA maintains a list of approved biological products, which is commonly referred to as the Purple Book. This list includes product names, the date of licensure, and any periods of regulatory exclusivity. Following the exchange of patent information between the biosimilar and reference product sponsor, the reference product sponsor must also provide the exchanged patent information and patent expiry dates to the FDA. The FDA then publishes this information in the Purple Book.

To increase competition in the drug and biologic product marketplace, Congress, the executive branch, and the FDA have taken certain legislative and regulatory steps. By example, the FDA finalized a guidance to facilitate biologic product importation. Moreover, the 2020 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act included provisions requiring that sponsors of approved biologic products, including those subject to REMS, provide samples of the approved products to persons developing biosimilar products within specified timeframes, in sufficient quantities, and on commercially reasonable market-based terms. Failure to do so can subject the approved product sponsor to civil actions, penalties, and responsibility for attorney’s fees and costs of the civil action. This same bill also includes provisions with respect to shared and separate REMS programs.
Orphan Drug Exclusivity
​
Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may designate a biological product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biological product available in the U.S. for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan drug designation if there is a product already approved by the FDA that is considered by the FDA to be the same as the already approved product and is intended for the same indication. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan exclusivity. With respect to gene therapies, the FDA has issued a specific guidance on how the agency interprets its sameness regulations. Specifically, whether two products are deemed to be the same by the FDA will depend on the products’ transgene expression, viral vectors groups and variants, and additional product features that may contribute to therapeutic effect. Minor product differences will not, generally, result in a finding that two products are different and there are some factors that FDA will consider on a case-by-case basis. Any of the FDA sameness determinations could impact our ability to receive approval for our product candidates and to obtain or retain orphan drug exclusivity.
​
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval, it may be granted seven years of marketing exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, unless clinical superiority is demonstrated. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. Notably, a 2021 judicial decision, 
Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra
, 14 F. 4
th
 1299 (11th Cir 2021), 
challenged and reversed an FDA decision on the scope of orphan product exclusivity for the drug, 
Firdapse
. Under this decision, orphan drug exclusivity for Firdapse blocked approval of another company’s application for the same drug for the entire disease or condition for which orphan drug designation was granted, not just the disease or condition for which approval was received. In a January 2023 Federal Register notice, however, FDA stated that it intends to continue to apply its regulations tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved. The exact scope of orphan drug exclusivity will likely be an evolving area.
​
Orphan drug designation does not change the FDA’s standard for product approval.  The FDA’s regulations, however, provide flexibility in meeting such approval standards such that the FDA may exercise scientific judgment in determining the kind and quantity of data required for approval and during development programs.  Per guidance issued by the FDA in 2023, “[t]his flexibility extends from the early stages of development to the design of adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations required to demonstrate effectiveness to support marketing approval and to establish safety data needed for the intended use.” The FDA states that it “is committed to helping sponsors create successful drug development programs that address the particular challenges posed by each disease.”
​
Pediatric Exclusivity
​
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, pediatric exclusivity provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity in the US, including orphan exclusivity and reference biologic exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if the FDA issues a written request to the sponsor for the pediatric study, the sponsor submits a final study report after receipt of the written request and meets the terms and timelines in the FDA’s written request.

Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designation
​
The 21
st
 Century Cures Act became law in December 2016 and created a new program under Section 3033 in which the FDA has authority to designate a product as a regenerative medicine advanced therapy (“RMAT”). A drug is eligible for a RMAT designation if: 1) it is a regenerative medicine therapy which is a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, except those products already regulated under Section 361 of the PHSA; 2) the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and 3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. A RMAT designation request must be made with the submission of an IND or as an amendment to an existing IND. FDA will determine if a product is eligible for RMAT designation within 60 days of submission. Advantages of the RMAT designation include all the benefits of the fast track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with the FDA. These early interactions may be used to discuss potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints to support accelerated approval. In 2019 the FDA stated in guidance that human gene therapies, including genetically modified cells, that lead to a sustained effect on cells or tissues, may meet the definition of a regenerative therapy. 
​
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics and Other Combination Products
​
We may seek to develop companion diagnostics for use in identifying patients that we believe will respond to our gene therapies. Similarly, our product candidates may require delivery devices. A biologic product may be regulated as a combination product if it is intended for use in conjunction with a medical device, such as a drug delivery device or an in vitro diagnostic device. For combination products, the biologic and device components must, when used together, be safe and effective and the product labeling must reflect their combined use. In some cases, the medical device component may require a separate premarket submission. Moreover, clinical trial sponsors using investigational devices in their studies must comply with FDA’s investigational device exemption regulations. If the device component (e.g., in vitro diagnostic device) is not packaged with the drug component and authorized by the FDA as a combination product, or approved or cleared as a medical device, the device component must comply with the FDA general controls applicable to a medical device, including establishment registration, device listing, device labeling, unique device identifier, quality system regulation, medical device reporting, and reporting of corrections and removals requirements.  If the device component is packaged with the drug component (e.g., drug delivery device), then only certain FDA general controls applicable to a medical device will apply (assuming the manufacturer’s quality system complies with the cGMPs).
​
If the safety or effectiveness of a biologic product is dependent on the results of a diagnostic, the FDA may require that the in vitro companion diagnostic device and biologic product be contemporaneously authorized by the FDA, with labeling that describes the use of the two products together. The type of premarket submission required for a companion diagnostic device will depend on the FDA device classification. A premarket approval (“PMA”), application is required for high-risk devices classified as Class III; a 510(k) premarket notification is generally required for moderate risk devices classified as Class II. Low risk devices classified as Class I generally do not require any FDA premarket authorization, with limited exceptions. A de novo request may be used for novel devices not previously classified by the FDA (and hence are automatically Class III) but are low or moderate risk (due to the application of special controls) and thus can be re-classified as Class II or Class I. Except in some limited circumstances, the FDA generally will not approve a biologic that is dependent upon the use of a companion diagnostic device if the device is not contemporaneously FDA-approved or -cleared. It’s also possible that an in vitro diagnostic device could be subject to FDA enforcement discretion from compliance with the FDCA if it meets the definition of a Laboratory Developed Test (“LDT”).  However, FDA issued a final rule in April 2024 to end enforcement discretion for LDTs and actively regulate such products as medical devices.  Under this final rule, LDTs are required to come into compliance with FDA’s medical device regulatory requirements in a staged approach over the course of four years. The implementation of this LDT final rule could potentially be affected by the Executive Order, Regulatory Freeze Pending Review, issued by President Trump on January 20, 2025 and/or the anticipated change in leadership at FDA under the new administration.  
​
Post-approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to the FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements related to manufacturing, recordkeeping, and reporting, including adverse experience reporting, deviation reporting, shortage reporting, and periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, marketing, promotion, certain electronic records and signatures, and post-approval obligations imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS, and surveillance to assess safety and effectiveness after commercialization.

Table of Contents
After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual program user fee requirements for approved products, excluding orphan products provided that certain criteria are met. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, require label modifications, or request product recalls, among other actions, if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. In fact, in 2023, the FDA issued a guidance specifically on demonstrating product comparability, and the management and reporting of manufacturing changes for investigational and licensed cellular and gene therapy products. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and specifications and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
The FDA also strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. A company can make only those advertising and promotional claims relating to a product that are consistent with the label approved by the FDA. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, may prescribe legally available products for unapproved indications that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and that have been approved by the FDA. Biopharmaceutical companies, however, are required to promote their products only for the approved indications and in a manner that is consistent with the provisions of the approved label. Companies must also provide adequate balancing information on a product’s risks in its advertising and promotional pieces.  In 2023, the FDA took a few actions in the advertising and promotional spaces, including issuing a final rule and a guidance on risk and efficacy disclosures in direct-to-consumer advertising. At the beginning of 2025, FDA also finalized guidance on communication of off-label scientific information about approved products. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including, but not limited to, criminal fines and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government procurement and non-procurement programs, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts.
Moreover, the enacted Drug Quality and Security Act (“DQSA”), imposes obligations on sponsors of biopharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, sponsors are required to provide certain information regarding the products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, are required to label products with a product identifier, and are required to keep certain records regarding the product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by sponsors is also required to be done electronically and will be required to allow interoperable electronic product tracing at the package level. Sponsors must also verify that purchasers of the sponsors’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufactures have product verification responsibilities, as well as investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. Similar requirements additionally are also imposed through this legislation on other companies within the biopharmaceutical product supply chain, such as distributors and dispensers, as well as certain sponsor licensees and affiliates.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements before or after approval, may result in significant regulatory actions. Such actions may include refusal to approve pending applications, license or approval suspension or revocation, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, provision of corrective information, imposition of post-market requirements including the need for additional testing, imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, FDA debarment, injunctions, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government procurement and non-procurement programs, refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, including fines and imprisonment, and adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences.

Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the U.S. and between states.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing the results of all the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer.
In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
Patent Term Restoration
​
If approved, biologic products may also be eligible for periods of U.S. patent term restoration. If an application for patent term restoration is timely filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and granted, patent term restoration extends the patent life of a single unexpired patent, that has not previously been extended, for a maximum of five years. The total patent life of the product with the extension also cannot exceed fourteen years from the product’s approval date. Subject to the prior limitations, the period of the extension is calculated by adding half of the time from the effective date of an IND to the initial submission of a complete marketing application, and all the time between the submission of the marketing application and its approval. This period may also be reduced by any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence.
Anti-Kickback Provisions and other Fraud and Abuse Requirements
​
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) is a criminal statute that prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs, in whole or in part. The term “remuneration” has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between biopharmaceutical industry members on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. The Beneficiary Inducement Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes similar restrictions on interactions between the biopharmaceutical industry and federal healthcare program beneficiaries. There are certain statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the AKS protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce or reward prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. 
​

Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce or reward referrals of federal healthcare program business, including purchases of products paid by federal healthcare programs, the statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, of 2010, as amended, (the “ACA”) modified the intent requirement under the AKS to a stricter standard, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA also provided that a violation of the AKS is grounds for the government or a whistleblower to assert that a claim for reimbursement submitted to a federal healthcare program for payment of items or services resulting from such violation constitutes a per se false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) promulgated a regulation in November 2020 with respect to the safe harbors that is effective in two phases. First, the regulation excludes from the definition of “remuneration” limited categories of (a) Pharmacy Benefit Manager (“PBM”) rebates or other reductions in price to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D or a Medicaid Managed Care Organization plan reflected in point-of-sale reductions in price and (b) PBM service fees. Second, the regulation expressly provides that rebates to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly to the plan sponsor under Medicare Part D or indirectly through a PBM, will not be protected under the AKS discounts safe harbor. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 extended a moratorium on the implementation, administration or enforcement of this final rule until January 1, 2032. 
​
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare provider or supplier numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of off-label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a product’s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to products, contract requirements, and services rendered. In addition, private payers have been filing follow-on lawsuits alleging fraudulent misrepresentation, although establishing liability and damages in these cases is more difficult than under the FCA. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. Rather, a claim may be false for deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information provided or for acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of that information. Civil False Claims Act actions may be brought by the government or may be brought by private individuals on behalf of the government, called “qui tam” actions. If the government decides to intervene in a qui tam action and prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in the proceeds from any damages, penalties or settlement funds. If the government declines to intervene, the individual may pursue the case alone. The civil FCA provides for treble damages and a civil penalty for each false claim, such as an invoice or pharmacy claim for reimbursement, which can aggregate into tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars. For these reasons, since 2004, False Claims Act lawsuits against biopharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements, as much as $3.0 billion, regarding certain sales practices and promoting off label uses. Civil False Claims Act liability may further be imposed for known Medicare or Medicaid overpayments, for example, overpayments caused by understated rebate amounts, that are not refunded within 60 days of the identification of the overpayment, even if the overpayment was not caused by a false or fraudulent act. In addition, civil judgment for violating the FCA may result in exclusion from federal healthcare programs, suspension and debarment from government procurement and non-procurement programs, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts. The majority of states also have statutes similar to the AKS and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.
​
The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim.
​
The Civil Monetary Penalties Law is another potential statute under which biopharmaceutical companies may be subject to enforcement. Among other things, the civil monetary penalties statue imposes fines against any person who is determined to have knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

Payment or reimbursement of prescription therapeutics by Medicaid or Medicare requires sponsors to submit certified pricing information to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The Medicaid Drug Rebate statute requires sponsors to calculate and report price points, which are used to determine Medicaid manufacturer rebate payments shared between the states and the federal government and Medicaid payment rates for certain therapeutics. For therapeutics paid under Medicare Part B, sponsors must also calculate and report their Average Sales Price, which is used to determine the Medicare Part B payment rate. In addition, therapeutics covered by Medicaid are subject to an additional inflation penalty which can substantially increase rebate payments. For certain products, including those approved under a BLA (including biosimilars), the Veterans Health Care Act (the “VHCA”) requires sponsors to calculate and report to the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) a different price called the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price, which is used to determine the maximum price that can be charged to certain federal agencies, referred to as the Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”). Like the Medicaid rebate amount, the FCP includes an inflation penalty. A Department of Defense regulation requires sponsors to provide this discount on therapeutics dispensed by retail pharmacies when paid by the TRICARE Program. All these price reporting requirements create risk of submitting false information to the government, potential FCA liability and exclusion from certain of these programs.
​
The VHCA also requires sponsors of covered therapeutics participating in the Medicaid program to enter into Federal Supply Schedule contracts with the VA through which their covered therapeutics must be sold to certain federal agencies at FCP. This necessitates compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations, including submission of commercial sales and pricing information, and subjects companies to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions. In addition, the VHCA requires sponsors participating in Medicaid to agree to provide different mandatory discounts to certain Public Health Service grantees and other safety net hospitals and clinics under the 340B program based on the sponsor’s reported Medicaid pricing information. The 340B program has its own regulatory authority to impose sanctions for non-compliance, adjudicate overcharge claims against sponsors by the purchasing entities, and impose civil monetary penalties for instances of overcharging.
​
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (“HIPAA”), also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters. Additionally, the ACA amended the intent requirement of certain of these criminal statutes under HIPAA so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation.
​
In addition, as part of the ACA, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Manufacturers of drugs, biologics and devices for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) are required to annually report to CMS certain payments and other transfers of value made to or at the request of covered recipients, which are physicians (as defined under the Social Security Act), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwifes licensed in the U.S. and U.S. teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and members of their immediate family. Payments made to principal investigators and research institutions for clinical trials are also included within this law. Reported information is made publicly available by CMS. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. If not preempted by this federal law, several states currently also require reporting of marketing and promotion expenses, as well as gifts and payments to healthcare professionals and organizations. State legislation may also prohibit gifts and various other marketing related activities or require the public posting of information. Certain states also require companies to implement compliance programs.

Further, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, (“HITECH Act”), and their respective implementing regulations impose certain requirements on covered entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of certain individually identifiable health information known as protected health information. Among other things, the HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, made HIPAA’s security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as persons or organizations, other than members of a covered entity’s workforce, that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. The HITECH Act also strengthened the civil and criminal sanctions that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates, and individuals, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. HIPAA privacy rules governing disclosures of protected health information by covered entities for research purposes may apply to gene therapy studies. In addition, other federal and state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and state security breach notification laws and state consumer healthcare privacy laws, may govern the privacy and security of health and other information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
​
Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Certain state laws also regulate sponsors’ use of prescriber-identifiable data. Certain states also require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance program guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments or the provision of other items of value that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; impose restrictions on marketing practices; or require sponsors to track and report information related to payments, gifts, and other items of value to physicians and other healthcare providers and entities. Recently, states have enacted or are considering legislation intended to make drug prices more transparent and deter significant price increases that impose reporting requirements on biopharmaceutical companies. These laws may affect our future sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. Such laws also typically impose significant civil monetary penalties for each instance of reporting noncompliance that can quickly aggregate into the tens of millions of dollars.
​
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties or other enforcement actions, including significant civil monetary penalties, damages, criminal fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government procurement and non-procurement programs, refusal of orders under existing government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business.
​
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
​
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, imposes certain recordkeeping requirements and prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.

Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
​
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state, and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payers and independent non-profit healthcare research organizations such as the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review are also increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity, budget-impact, and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payers do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies and/or the standard of care, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, measures including prior authorization and step-throughs could be required, manufacturer rebates may be negotiated or required and/or the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. The U.S. federal and state governments and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. In this regard, for example, on November 27, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing a Most Favored Nation payment model under which reimbursement for certain Medicare Part B drugs and biologicals will be based on a price that reflects the lowest per capital Gross Domestic Product-adjusted (“GDP-adjusted”) price of any non-U.S. member country of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) with a GDP per capita that is at least sixty percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. While this rule now has been rescinded, government negotiation of certain Medicare drug pricing continues to be the focus of recent proposed legislation. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. Failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to reach required deficit reduction goals triggered the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year. While President Biden previously signed legislation to eliminate this reduction through the end of 2021, a 1% payment adjustment was implemented from April 1 – June 30, 2022, and a 2% payment adjustment took effect beginning July 1, 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires manufacturers of selected drugs to negotiate discounted prices with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Failure to reach an agreement can subject manufacturers to an excise tax or withdrawal of all drug products from coverage under Medicare and Medicaid. Adoption of additional healthcare reform controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
​
As a result, the marketability of any product which receives regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers choose to provide low coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our products, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the U.S., and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Coverage policies, third party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Multiple other current and proposed legislative and regulatory efforts require and likely will in the future require payment of increased manufacturer rebates and implement mechanisms to reduce drug prices. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products that receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

Regulation in the European Union
​
Product development, the regulatory approval process and safety monitoring of medicinal products and their manufacturers in the European Union proceed broadly in the same way as they do in the U.S. Therefore, many of the issues discussed above apply similarly in the context of the European Union. In addition, drugs are subject to the extensive price and reimbursement regulations of the various EU member states. The Clinical Trial Regulation EU 536/2014 (“CTR”), which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, as amended (“CTD”), on January 31, 2022, provides a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The CTR is directly applicable in all member states without the need for national implementation. Whilst, for trials conducted in only one country, approval has to be obtained from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted before cross-border trials within the EU, it is possible to make a single harmonized electronic submission and have a single assessment process for clinical trials conducted in multiple member states. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”), which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the CTR and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. In the case of Advanced Therapy Investigational Medical Products (“ATIMPs”) consisting of or containing Genetically Modified Organisms (“GMOs”), as is the case for our products, an additional approval for the environmental and biosafety aspects of the use and release of the GMO is required by the GMO competent authorities. Unlike EU Regulations, EU Directives require national implementation and GMO Directives have been implemented in different ways by Member States; either following the Directive for “Contained use” (Directive 2009/41/EC) or “deliberate release” (Directive 2001/18/EC). As a consequence, in some EU member states the GMO application must be approved before the CTA is submitted, in some after approval of the CTA, and in some, in parallel.
​
The sponsor of a clinical trial, or its legal representative, must be based in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). European regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of adverse event reports during a study and a copy of the final study report. Under the CTR, member states may dispense with the requirement for a legal representative for a non-EU resident sponsor provided there is a contact person based in the EEA.
​
Under the CTR, the introduction of a new databased called the Clinical Trial Information System (“CTIS”), requires sponsors to upload and submit all data, including initial clinical trial application data and documentation, to the CTIS, with such data being publicly available, with few exceptions. This means data transparency throughout the development process with the onus on sponsors to protect patient and commercial confidentiality at the point of submission.
​
Marketing approval
​
Marketing approvals under the European Union regulatory system may be obtained through a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure results in the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all 27 EU member states. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, the centralized procedure is mandatory for drugs developed by means of specified biotechnological processes, and advanced therapy medicinal products as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007, as amended. Drugs for human use containing a new active substance for which the therapeutic indication is the treatment of specified diseases, including but not limited to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, neurodegenerative disorders, auto-immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, as well as drugs designated as orphan drugs pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, as amended, also fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Because of our focus on gene therapies, which fall within the category of advanced therapy medicinal products (“ATMPs”) and orphan indications, our products and product candidates will need to go through the centralized procedure.
​
33
​

Table of Contents
In the marketing authorization application (“MAA”) the applicant must properly and sufficiently demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of the drug. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) is the European Medicines Agency's (“EMA”) committee responsible for human medicines. Guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs have been issued and include, among other things, the nonclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs; the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a MAA; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long-term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs. Although these guidelines are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance will effectively be necessary to gain and maintain approval for any of our product candidates. The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the centralized procedure is 210 days after receipt of a valid application subject to clock stops during which the applicant deals with CHMP questions.
​
Market access can be expedited through the grant of conditional authorization for a medicine that may fulfil unmet needs which may be granted provided that the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive. The benefit-risk balance is likely to be positive if the applicant can provide comprehensive data and the benefit to public health of the medicinal product's immediate availability on the market outweighs the risks due to need for further data. Such authorizations are valid for one year and can be renewed annually. The holder will be required to complete specific obligations (ongoing or new studies, and in some cases additional activities) with a view to providing comprehensive data confirming that the benefit-risk balance is positive. Once comprehensive data on the product have been obtained, the conditional authorization may be converted into a standard marketing authorization (“MA”) (not subject to specific obligations). Initially, this is valid for 5 years, but can be renewed for unlimited validity. Applicants for conditional authorizations can benefit from early dialogue with CHMP through scientific advice or protocol assistance and discuss their development plan well in advance of the submission of a MAA. Other stakeholders (e.g., health technology assessment bodies) can be included.
​
In addition, the priority medicines (“PRIME”) scheme for medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options based on early clinical data, is intended to support the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. This voluntary scheme is based on enhanced interaction and early dialogue with developers of promising medicines, to optimize development plans and speed up evaluation so these medicines can reach patients earlier. Early dialogue and scientific advice also ensure that patients only participate in trials designed to provide the data necessary for an application, making the best use of limited resources.
​
The European Union also provides for a system of regulatory data and market exclusivity. According to Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Article 10 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities approved on the basis of complete independent data package benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application during the eight-year period from when the first placement of the product on the EEA market. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the innovator can gain the period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests, and clinical trials. The EMA has also issued guidelines for a comprehensive comparability exercise for biosimilars, and for specific classes of biological products. Under European Commission proposals for revisions to the EU’s pharmaceutical legislation, the standard period of data protection may be reduced from eight to six years, but this may be extended by up to four years if particular criteria are fulfilled: i.e., two additional years if the new product is available in all EU Member States; an additional six months if the product addresses an unmet medical need; an additional six months for new chemical entities where the supporting clinical trials use an evidence-based comparator based on EMA scientific advice; and an additional year if, during the data protection period following authorization, the MA holder receives an authorization for an additional therapeutic indication for which there is a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (replacing the additional year of marketing protection available under the current regime).  The additional period of marketing exclusivity protection (described above) will remain as two years following the expiry of the data protection period. These proposals will be subject to continuing discussion so it is not certain when and in what form the new legislation will be adopted.

Under Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 article 3 as amended (Orphan Drug Regulation, (“ODR”)) a product can benefit from orphan drug status if it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Community (EC) when the application is made. The principal benefit of such status is 10 years’ market exclusivity once the MA is granted the subsequent approval of similar medicines with similar indications although this may be reduced to six years under certain circumstances including if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Under the above-mentioned proposed new legislation, other than for orphan drugs addressing a high unmet medical need, the current 10-year period would be reduced to nine years. These periods may be extended by one year if either: the new product is available in all EU member states; or at least two years before the expiry of the orphan exclusivity period, the orphan MA holder obtains an MA for one or more further therapeutic indications for a different orphan condition.
​
Additional rules apply to medicinal products for pediatric use under Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. Potential incentives include a six-month extension of any supplementary protection certificate granted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 469/2009, however not in cases in which the relevant product is designated as an orphan medicinal product pursuant to the ODR. Instead, medicinal products designated as orphan medicinal product may enjoy an extension of the ten-year market exclusivity period granted under Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, as amended, to twelve years subject to the conditions applicable to orphan drugs. The proposed new legislation will retain the 6-month SPC extension but  there would be an explicit obligation to place an authorized product with a pediatric indication on the market in every member state where the adult presentation is marketed.  Additionally, the current separate reward of two years market exclusivity for pediatric indications of orphan products would no longer apply under the proposed legislation.
​
Manufacturing and promotion
​
Pursuant to European Commission Directive 2003/94/EC as transposed into the national laws of the member states, the manufacturing of investigational medicinal products and approved drugs is subject to a separate manufacturer’s license and must be conducted in strict compliance with cGMP requirements, which mandate the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. Manufacturers must have at least one qualified person permanently and continuously at their disposal. The qualified person is ultimately responsible for certifying that each batch of finished product released onto the market has been manufactured in accordance with cGMP and the specifications set out in the marketing authorization or investigational medicinal product dossier. cGMP requirements are enforced through mandatory registration of facilities and inspections of those facilities. Failure to comply with these requirements could interrupt supply and result in delays, unanticipated costs, and lost revenues, and subject the applicant to potential legal or regulatory action, including but not limited to warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, or possible civil and criminal penalties.
​
Advertising
​
In the European Union, the promotion of prescription medicines is subject to intense regulation and control, including a prohibition on direct-to-consumer advertising. All medicines advertising must be consistent with the product’s approved summary of products characteristics, factual, accurate, balanced and not misleading. Advertising of medicines pre-approval or off-label is prohibited. Some jurisdictions require that all promotional materials for prescription medicines be subjected to either prior internal or regulatory review & approval.
​
Other Regulatory Requirements
​
A holder of a MA for a medicinal product is legally obliged to fulfill several obligations by virtue of its status as a marketing authorization holder (“MAH”). The MAH can delegate the performance of related tasks to third parties, such as distributors or marketing collaborators, provided that this delegation is appropriately documented and the MAH maintains legal responsibility and liability.
​
The obligations of an MAH include:
​
●
Manufacturing and Batch Release. 
MAHs should guarantee that all manufacturing operations comply with relevant laws and regulations, applicable GMP, with the product specifications and manufacturing conditions set out in the marketing authorization and that each batch of product is subject to appropriate release formalities.
35
​

Table of Contents
●
Pharmacovigilance. 
MAHs are obliged to establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system, including a qualified person responsible for oversight, to submit safety reports to the regulators and comply with the good pharmacovigilance practice guidelines adopted by the EMA.
●
Advertising and Promotion. 
MAHs remain responsible for all advertising and promotion of their products, including promotional activities by other companies or individuals on their behalf and in some cases, must conduct internal or regulatory pre-approval of promotional materials.
●
Medical Affairs/Scientific Service. 
MAHs are required to disseminate scientific and medical information on their medicinal products to healthcare professionals, regulators, and patients.
●
Legal Representation and Distributor Issues. 
MAHs are responsible for regulatory actions or inactions of their distributors and agents.
●
Preparation, Filing and Maintenance of the Application and Subsequent Marketing Authorization.
 MAHs must maintain appropriate records, comply with the MA’s terms and conditions, fulfill reporting obligations to regulators, submit renewal applications and pay all appropriate fees to the authorities.
​
We may hold any future marketing authorizations granted for our product candidates in our own name or appoint an affiliate or a collaborator to hold MAs on our behalf. Any failure by an MAH to comply with these obligations may result in regulatory action against an MAH and ultimately threaten our ability to commercialize our products.
​
Reimbursement
​
In the European Union, the pricing and reimbursement mechanisms by private and public health insurers vary largely by country and even within countries. In respect of the public systems, reimbursement for standard drugs is determined by guidelines established by the legislature or responsible national authority. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other member states allow companies to determine the prices for their medicines but monitor and control company profits and may limit or restrict reimbursement and can include retrospective rebates to the government. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products and some of EU countries require the completion of studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Special pricing and reimbursement rules may apply to orphan drugs. 
​
Inclusion of orphan drugs in reimbursement systems tend to focus on the medical usefulness, need, quality and economic benefits to patients and the healthcare system as for any drug. Acceptance of any medicinal product for reimbursement may come with cost, use and often volume restrictions, which again can vary by country. In addition, results-based rules or agreements on reimbursement may apply. Recently, a process has been formalized that allows sponsors to receive parallel advice from EMA and relevant national health technology assessment (“HTA”) bodies for pivotal clinical studies designed to support marketing approval. This process was followed for etranacogene dezaparvovec.

Orphan Drug Regulation
​
We have been granted orphan drug exclusivity for AMT-130 for the treatment of Huntington’s disease subject to the conditions applicable to orphan drug exclusivity in the European Union. The ODR states that a drug will be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish:
​
●
that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the community when the application is made, or that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment; and
●
that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, that the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
​
Regulation (EC) No 847/2000 sets out further provisions for implementation of the criteria for designation of a drug as an orphan drug. An application for the designation of a drug as an orphan drug must be submitted at any stage of development of the drug before filing of a MAA.
​
If an EU-wide community marketing authorization in respect of an orphan drug is granted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, the European Union and the member states will not, for a period of 10 years, accept another MAA, or grant a MA or accept an application to extend an existing MA, for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar drug.
​
This period may however be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established, in respect of the drug concerned, that the criteria for orphan drug designation are no longer met, in other words, when it is shown on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a MA may be granted, for the same therapeutic indication, to a similar drug if:
●
the holder of the MA for the original orphan drug has given its consent to the second applicant;
●
the holder of the MA for the original orphan drug is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the drug; or
●
the second applicant can establish in the application that the second drug, although similar to the orphan drug already authorized, is safer, more effective, or otherwise clinically superior.
​
Regulation (EC) No 847/2000 lays down definitions of the concepts similar drug and clinical superiority, which concepts have been expanded upon in subsequent European Commission guidance. Other incentives available to orphan drugs in the European Union include financial incentives such as a reduction of fees or fee waivers and protocol assistance. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. As described above, the above proposed legislation would, if implemented, impact orphan protection in the future.
