Who We Are

CarGurus is a multinational, online automotive platform for buying and selling vehicles that is building upon its industry-leading listings marketplace with both digital retail solutions and the CarOffer online wholesale platform, each powered by data-driven insights. The CarGurus platform gives consumers the confidence to purchase and/or sell a vehicle either online or in person, and it gives dealerships the power to accurately price, effectively market, instantly acquire, and quickly sell vehicles, all with a nationwide reach. We use proprietary technology, search algorithms, and data analytics to bring trust, transparency, and competitive pricing to the automotive shopping experience.

We operate the following marketplaces:

U.S., U.K., and Canada

U.S.

U.K.

CarOffer is a subsidiary of CarGurus and operates as an independent brand.

Autolist and PistonHeads operate as independent brands.

CarGurus is the most visited online automotive marketplace in the U.S. (Similarweb, Traffic Report (Cars.com, Autotrader, CARFAX Listings (defined as CARFAX total visits minus Vehicle History Reports traffic), TrueCar, Q4 2024). Founded in 2006 by Langley Steinert, our intelligence-driven platform provides easily accessible vehicle prices and transparent dealer ratings, information imperative to a consumer’s vehicle purchase. By providing car-shoppers with the tools and insights necessary for their car-shopping journey, we have garnered a high-intent, ready-to-purchase consumer audience. As of December 31, 2024, we had 29.3 million average monthly visitors in the U.S., which, in turn, has attracted over 30,000 dealers (including 24,692 paying dealers) to list on our U.S. marketplace platform. As a result, we have the largest inventory selection among listings sites in the U.S. (compared to Autotrader.com, Cars.com, TrueCar.com (YipitData as of 12/31/2024), and CARFAX (Joreca as of 12/31/2024)).

Our platform supports consumers and dealers alike across the full cycle of their buying and selling needs: allowing consumers to shop, finance, buy, and sell and allowing dealers to source, price, market, and sell vehicles. Through our evolution, our ultimate goal remains the same: to empower our customers by giving them all the tools and information they need to buy or sell any car, anywhere, at the right price, and in the right way for them. At CarGurus, 
we give people the power to reach their destination
.

Segments

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we managed our business and reported earnings through two reportable segments:

•
U.S. Marketplace: Derives revenue from marketplace services for customers within the U.S. 

•
Digital Wholesale: Primarily derives revenue from our Dealer-to-Dealer and Instant Max Cash Offer services sold on our CarOffer platform.

Our Products and Services

U.S. Marketplace and Other

The product offerings described below are available through our U.S. marketplace; availability on our other marketplaces varies.

Marketplace

Our online automotive marketplace allows consumers to search for new and used car listings from our dealers based on our proprietary search algorithm. Our marketplace is the trusted source for consumers based on the key algorithms that make up the major elements of our marketplace product:

•
Deal Rating
: Eligible used car listings in our marketplace are assigned one of five Deal Ratings: Great Deal, Good Deal, Fair Deal, High Priced, or Overpriced. Deal Ratings are based on Instant Market Value, or IMV (our proprietary algorithm that assesses the market value of a used vehicle in a local market), and Dealer Ratings (ratings derived from our users’ experiences with the dealers they have connected with). We calculate IMV by applying more than 20 ranking signals and more than 100 normalization rules to tens of millions of data points, including the make, model, trim, year, features, condition, history, geographic location, and mileage of the car. 

•
New Car Price Information
: Deal Rating is not applicable to listings of new cars because it utilizes data not relevant to new cars. Instead, we analyze data on manufacturers’ suggested retail prices and recent sales of similar new vehicles, accounting for trade-ins, incentives, and other factors that can affect the price of a new car, to provide users with comparative price information.

•
Search Results Page and Vehicle Detail Page
: Our Search Results Page, or SRP, provides users with vehicle-specific details such as Deal Ratings as well as in-depth search filters, which we believe deliver the most comprehensive search capability among major U.S. online automotive marketplaces. We also provide our users with additional features to aid their search, including similar vehicle recommendations, side-by-side vehicle comparisons, expert reviews, and user rankings. Vehicle Detail Pages, or VDPs, include comprehensive information about the vehicle, including details such as dealership information, dealer reviews and ratings, payment calculators, vehicle history, price history, and time on site as well as numerous photos. 

•
Artificial Intelligence, or AI, Features
: Rapid advancements in consumer-facing AI have transformed the way that consumers search for and gather information, and we have introduced functionality based on generative AI to improve the user experience on our website, such as features assisting consumer research and reviews.

Digital Deal

We offer consumers the ability to transact additional elements of their car-buying experience through our websites as they seek to complete more of this process online. Our Digital Deal offering allows shoppers to “start purchase” from a VDP on eligible listings, providing them with purchase options, including estimating a car’s trade-in value, deciding on payment options, selecting finance and insurance products, making an appointment, placing a reservation deposit, and/or taking delivery of the vehicle (through our Geo Expansion tool), all while undergoing a seamless online-to-in-store experience. Digital Deal generates revenue by charging subscription fees to dealerships to enroll in this program and through our Finance in Advance product, as described below.

Finance in Advance

Through partnerships with automotive lending companies, eligible consumers can pre-qualify for financing on cars from dealerships that offer financing from these partners. We primarily generate revenue from these partnerships based on the number of funded loans from consumers who pre-qualify with our lending partners through our site. We believe this program provides more transparency to car-shoppers about actual payments to be offered at the dealership specific to participating lenders and delivers highly qualified car-shopper leads to participating dealers.

Sell My Car – Top Dealer Offers

We have two products that allow consumers to sell their cars: (1) Sell My Car – Top Dealer Offers and (2) Sell My Car – Instant Max Cash Offer. Top Dealer Offers allows dealers to make tailored trade-in offers on CarGurus consumer vehicles, generating valuable

trade-in leads for their business. CarGurus dealers have control over their bidding and direct access to consumers actively looking to sell their vehicles. All leads are delivered directly to the dealer and include detailed consumer contact information and other insights to help the dealer close the deal. Instant Max Cash Offer is part of our Digital Wholesale segment (see “Sell My Car – Instant Max Cash Offer” below for more details).

Dealer Listings and Data Insights Products

As the trusted source for consumers, our marketplace connects dealers to a large audience of informed and engaged consumers while providing dealers with actionable data based insights. We offer the following Listings and Data Insights subscriptions to dealers through tiered sets of packages providing: (1) leads and connections; (2) sponsored placements; (3) branding; and (4) tools and insights.

We also offer Featured and Featured Priority subscriptions, comparable to Featured+ and Featured Priority+, respectively, but without access to Digital Deal leads. Listings and Data Insights subscriptions are priced monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually based on a dealer’s inventory size and region and our assessment of the return on investment, or ROI, we expect to deliver through our lead quantity and quality and our innovation. Dealers may be renewed at higher rates commensurate with growth and updated performance expectations. In addition, dealers using our free service (Restricted) have access to capped anonymous leads and connections.

International

We also connect high-intent consumers with automotive dealers operating a leading automotive marketplace in Canada and the U.K., offering a transparent shopping experience similar to our U.S. marketplace. In the U.K., we provide one of the largest inventories of used vehicles and expert reviews, complemented by privately listed vehicles and expert review content on our PistonHeads website, as discussed below.

Autolist

Autolist provides consumers an online automotive marketplace through mobile applications and a website. The platform includes inventory from top automotive dealers across the U.S. and gives consumers quick access to manage their search on the go with real-time alerts of newly available inventory and changes that occur on vehicles and saved searches they have configured. An independent editorial staff produces content to keep consumers informed on the latest vehicles and trends in the automotive market.

PistonHeads

PistonHeads is a U.K. automotive marketplace, auction platform, and editorial site geared towards automotive enthusiasts. The platform allows consumers to search across a broad range of dealer and private seller listings and stay informed about automotive news through editorial articles and expert reviews. Paying U.K. dealers who list on the CarGurus platform automatically have their inventory added to the PistonHeads site for greater consumer reach. PistonHeads also runs PistonHeads Auctions, a platform that allows individuals and dealers to list their vehicles for auction and buyers to either bid at auction, make an offer before the auction starts, or commit to buy a vehicle at a set price before the auction starts.

Digital Wholesale

Dealer-to-Dealer

Our CarOffer platform delivers market insights directly into wholesale buying and selling decisions, empowering dealers to identify the most profitable opportunities and execute transactions within a data-driven wholesale platform. The CarOffer Matrix streamlines this process by allowing dealers to set standing buy orders and make instant offers, eliminating the need for manual bidding as well as by providing selling dealers with real-time market pricing and interest information for their vehicles. To ensure that dealers feel confident that their purchase will meet their expectations, we offer detailed mechanical inspections on the vehicles they purchase.

Sell My Car – Instant Max Cash Offer

Sell My Car – Instant Max Cash Offer allows consumers to sell vehicles to dealers entirely online, providing dealers with a fresh source of trade-in inventory and helping to ensure liquidity amongst CarOffer’s platform.

CarOffer processes transactions directly and collects dealer fees.

Mobile Applications

Consumer Mobile Application

CarGurus’ consumer mobile application offers a seamless experience for buying and selling cars with features such as search and browse tools with detailed filters, price analysis to evaluate deals, dealer reviews for informed decisions, and financing options with payment calculators.

Technology and Product Development

We are a technology and data company focused on utilizing our background as a trusted marketplace for consumers and dealers to provide our customers with innovative and actionable data analysis. We have built an extensive repository of data on cars, prices, dealers, and the interactions between consumers and dealers that is the result of many years of data aggregation and regression modeling. We design our mobile and web products to create a transparent experience for both consumers and dealers. We believe in rapid development, release frequent updates, and have internal tools and automation that allow us to efficiently evolve our products. Our software is built using a combination of internally developed software, third-party software and services, and open-source software.

Infrastructure

Our development servers and U.S. and Canadian websites are hosted through third-party cloud services in the U.S. and at third-party data centers in the U.S. near Dallas, Texas. Our European websites are hosted on third-party cloud computing services near each of London, England; Dublin, Ireland; and Frankfurt, Germany. We use third-party content distribution networks to cache and serve many portions of our sites at locations across the globe. We monitor and test at the application, host, network, and full-site levels to maintain availability and promote performance. We use third-party cloud computing services for many data processing jobs and backup/recovery services.

Marketing and Brand

Consumer Marketing

Through our consumer marketing program we engage consumers at all points of the consumers’ journey to communicate our brand values and value propositions as well as to drive consumer leads and transactions for our dealers and partners. We advertise through online and offline channels including linear, cable, and connected television, video, social media, display, search, content marketing, partnerships, sponsorships, influencers, and affiliate relationships. We continually test into emerging and new channels with the goal of optimizing our customer acquisition cost and driving awareness of our brand. We use our owned channels, including email, text

Table of Contents

messages, and on-site and in-app messaging, to deepen our relationships with existing customers. Leveraging our proprietary data and content, we also engage in press outreach to deliver our messages through organic media and articles. We largely drive our consumer marketing efforts internally, but engage agency partners when appropriate. Outside of the U.S., we tailor marketing efforts to local markets.

Dealer Marketing

Our dealer marketing team is primarily focused on building marketing assets that best educate dealer customers and prospects about our products. We execute dealer campaigns through a number of channels including email, direct mail, and social media with the aim to both drive leads to our sales teams and to increase product adoption and usage with new and existing customers. In addition, we host events to deepen our understanding of dealer needs and relationships and provide content and thought leadership to support dealer success.

Our marketing team consistently uses research to support ongoing improvement and development of our customer experience.

Sales

Our sales team is responsible for driving dealer acquisition, subscription conversions, and product adoption across franchise and independent dealerships. Both inside and field sales teams support strategic dealership groups in major markets in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., with additional advertising sales staff based in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.

Account Managers work with paying dealers to enhance satisfaction and retention through tailored support, including product usage guidance, inventory merchandising, ROI tracking, and profit growth strategies. Active communication with dealers strengthens relationships and fosters success on our platform.

CarOffer’s sales and service team focuses on supporting dealer satisfaction and retention, facilitating transactions, and onboarding new dealers to its platform.

We face competition to attract consumers and paying dealers to our marketplaces and services and to attract advertisers to purchase our advertising products and services. Our competitors offer various marketplaces, products, and services that compete with us. Some of these competitors include:

Competition for Consumers and Dealers

We compete for consumer visits with other online automotive marketplaces, free listing services, general search engines, online dealerships, and dealers’ websites. We compete for consumers primarily on the basis of the quality of the consumer experience and the breadth of offerings that we are able to provide. We believe we compare favorably on user experience due to the number of our vehicle listings, the transparency of the information we provide on cars, prices, and dealers, the intuitive nature of our user interface, and our mobile user experience, among other factors.

We compete for dealers’ marketing spend with offline customer acquisition channels, other online automotive marketplaces, dealers’ own customer acquisition efforts on search engines, social media marketplaces, and other internet sites, online dealerships, and vehicle auction companies that attract consumers and dealers searching for vehicles, as applicable. We compete primarily on the basis of the ROI that our marketplace offers and the synergies provided by the combination of our foundational Listings business with digital wholesale and digital retail offerings complemented by the leveraging our marketplace standing into insightful data analysis. We believe we compare favorably due to our large user audience, high user engagement, the volume and quality of connections we provide to well-informed consumers, and the high impact data insights we provide, which results in an attractive ROI for dealers.

Competition for Advertisers

We compete for a share of advertisers’ total marketing budgets against media sites, websites dedicated to helping consumers shop for cars, major internet portals, search engines, and social media sites, among others. We also compete for a share of advertisers’ overall marketing budgets with traditional media, such as television, radio, magazines, newspapers, automotive publications, billboards, and other offline advertising channels. We compete for advertising spend based on the marketing ROI that our marketplace provides. We believe we compare favorably due to our large user audience, high user engagement, and the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products.

Seasonality

Across the retail automotive industry, consumer purchasing activity is typically greatest in the first three quarters of each year, due in part to the introduction of new vehicle models from manufacturers and the seasonal nature of consumer spending.

Additionally, the volume of wholesale vehicle sales can fluctuate from quarter to quarter driven by several factors, including the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles, and/or inventory challenges in the automotive industry, which affect the demand side of the wholesale industry. Macroeconomic conditions, such as slower growth or recession, higher interest rates, unemployment, inflation, consumer confidence in the economy, consumer debt levels, labor disruptions, work stoppages, or strikes, geopolitical conflicts, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and other matters that influence consumer spending and preferences, can also impact the volume of wholesale vehicle sales, as was evidenced by the global semiconductor chip shortage and other supply-related shortages.

The Digital Wholesale segment operating results have reflected the general seasonality of the wholesale vehicle sales market and macroeconomic conditions of the automotive industry. The U.S. Marketplace segment operating results have reflected the macroeconomic conditions of the automotive industry. However, to date, the U.S. Marketplace segment operating results have not been materially impacted by the general seasonality of the automotive industry. This could possibly change as our business and markets mature.

People and Talent

Our investment in our greatest asset – our people – is integral to our core values, evidenced by our inclusion of employee development as components of our 2024 strategic and organizational initiatives. Our Board of Directors oversees our people and talent efforts and views building our culture – from employee development and retention to diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives – as key to driving long-term value for our business and helping mitigate risks. As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,282 full-time employees, 72 of whom were based outside the U.S. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

Intellectual Property

We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade secret protections, confidentiality procedures, and contractual restrictions.

CarGurus has one issued U.S. patent with an expiration date of May 2034, one pending U.S. patent application, and one pending international patent application. CarOffer has one pending U.S. patent application. These applications cover proprietary technology that relates to various functionalities on our platform, generally in connection with pricing, ranking, and detecting fraud in online listings. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial to our competitive position.

We have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions. We pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe doing so would be beneficial to our competitive position. Our registered trademarks remain enforceable in the countries in which they are registered for as long as we continue to use the marks, and pay the fees to maintain the registrations, in those countries.

We are the registered holder of several domestic and international domain names that include “CarGurus”, “CarOffer”, “Pistonheads”, and “Autolist” and other variations of our trade names.

We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees and relevant consultants, contractors, and business partners. We control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in contracts with our customers and partners and our general and product-specific terms of use on our websites.

Regulatory

Various aspects of our business are, may become, or may be viewed by regulators from time to time as subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations. In particular, the advertising and sale of new or used motor vehicles is highly regulated by the states and jurisdictions in which we do business. Regulatory authorities or third parties could take the position that some of the laws or regulations applicable to dealers or to the manner in which motor vehicles are advertised and sold generally are directly applicable to our business. These advertising laws and regulations, which often originated decades before the emergence of the internet, are frequently subject to multiple interpretations, are not uniform across jurisdictions, sometimes impose inconsistent requirements with respect to new or used motor vehicles, and the manner in which they should be applied to our business model is not always clear. Regulators or other third parties could take, and on some occasions have taken, the position that our marketplace or related products violate applicable brokering, bird-dog, consumer protection, or advertising laws or regulations.

Our wholesale operations through CarOffer are regulated by the states in which we operate and by the U.S. federal government. These activities may also be subject to state and local licensing requirements. Additionally, we may be subject to regulation by individual state dealer licensing authorities and state and local consumer protection agencies.

In order to operate in this regulated environment, we develop our products and services with a view toward appropriately managing the risk that our regulatory compliance, or the regulatory compliance of the dealers whose inventory is listed on our websites, could be challenged.

We consider applicable advertising and consumer protection laws and regulations in designing our products and services. We endeavor to design our website content in a manner that would comply with relevant advertising regulations and consumer protection laws if the content were to be considered vehicle sales advertising.

Our websites and mobile applications enable us, dealers, and users to send and receive text messages and other mobile phone communications, which requires us to comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, in the U.S. The TCPA, as interpreted and implemented by the Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, and federal and state courts, imposes significant restrictions on utilization of telephone calls and text messages to residential and mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, particularly when the prior express consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. In addition, we are subject to numerous federal, national, state, and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and around the world regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use, cross-border transfer, and protection of personal information and other data. While the scope of these laws and regulations is changing and remains subject to differing interpretations, we seek to comply

with industry standards and all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations, and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties.

Item 1A. Ri
sk Factors.

Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, some of which have previously occurred and any of which may occur in the future, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes, before evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties. In that event, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. See “Special Note Regarding Forward‑Looking Statements.”

Summary Risk Factors

Our business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

•
Our business is substantially dependent on our relationships with dealers. If a significant number of dealers terminate their subscription agreements with us and/or dealer closures or consolidations occur that reduce demand for our products, our business and financial results would be materially and adversely affected. 

•
If we fail to maintain or increase the number of dealers that pay subscription fees to us, or fail to maintain or increase the fees paid to us for subscriptions, our business and financial results would be materially and adversely affected. 

•
Our business is subject to risks related to the larger automotive industry ecosystem, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. 

•
If the CarOffer business and/or our combined offerings do not grow, our revenue and business could be adversely affected. 

•
If we are unable to provide a compelling experience to consumers on our marketplaces, connections between consumers and dealers using our marketplaces may decline and our business and financial results would be materially and adversely affected. 

•
Any inability by us to develop new products, adapt to new technologies, or achieve widespread consumer and dealer adoption of those products could negatively impact our business and financial results. 

•
We rely, in part, on internet search engines to drive traffic to our websites, and if we fail to appear prominently in the search results, our traffic would decline and our business would be adversely affected. 

•
Our future revenue is uncertain, including due to potential macroeconomic effects, including financial market volatility and disruption, inflationary concerns, changes in tax laws and regulations, interest and currency exchange rates, uncertain economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, and additional tariffs, including as a result of the recent U.S. presidential election.

•
We may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or if capital is not available to us, our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected. 

•
Our international operations involve risks that may differ from, or are in addition to, our domestic operational risks. 

•
Our goodwill, intangible assets, and other assets have been subject to impairment in the past and may be subject to further impairment in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or future operating results. 

•
We depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract, and integrate highly qualified personnel, or if we experience turnover of our key personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be materially and adversely affected. 

18

Table of Contents

•
We may be subject to disputes regarding the accuracy of IMV, Deal Ratings, Dealer Ratings, New Car Price Information, and other features of our marketplaces. 

•
We are subject to a complex framework of laws and regulations, many of which are unsettled, still developing, and contradictory, which have in the past, and could in the future, subject us to claims, challenge our business model or otherwise harm our business. 

•
A significant disruption in service on our websites or mobile applications could damage our reputation and result in a loss of consumers, which could harm our business, brands, operating results, and financial condition. 

•
We and our third-party service providers collect, process, store, transfer, share, disclose, and use consumer information and other data, and the actual or perceived failure of us or our third-party service providers to protect such information and data or respect users’ privacy could expose us to liability and adversely affect our reputation, brands, business, and operating results. 

•
Our ability to attract consumers to our websites and to provide certain services to our customers depends on the collection of consumer data from various sources, which may be restricted by consumer choice, privacy restrictions, and developments in laws, regulations, and industry standards. 

•
Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our business and operating results. 

•
We may be unable to halt the operations of websites that aggregate or misappropriate our data. 

•
Seasonality and other factors may cause fluctuations in our operating results and our marketing spend. 

•
Failure to deal effectively with fraud or other illegal activity could harm our business. 

Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock

•
Our founder controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and, therefore, has control over key decision-making and could control our actions in a manner that conflicts with the interests of other stockholders.

•
The trading price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the value of our stockholders’ investment in our stock could decline.

•
There can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase shares or that our share repurchase program will enhance stockholder value, and share repurchases could affect the price of our Class A common stock.

General Risk Factors

•
We participate in a highly competitive market, and pressure from existing and new companies may adversely affect our business and operating results.

•
We expect our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

Our business is substantially dependent on our relationships with dealers. If a significant number of dealers terminate their subscription agreements with us and/or dealer closures or consolidations occur that reduce demand for our products, our business and financial results would be materially and adversely affected.

A significant source of our revenue consists of subscription fees paid to us by dealers for access to enhanced features on our automotive marketplaces. The majority of our contracts with dealers currently provide for one-month committed terms and do not contain contractual obligations requiring a dealer to maintain its relationship with us beyond the committed term. If a significant number of our paying dealers independently or under advisement from influential groups (such as dealer associations, regulators, automotive manufacturers, and consumer advocates) decide to terminate their subscriptions with us, our business and financial results would be materially and adversely affected.

19

Table of Contents

Additionally, in the past, the number of U.S. dealers has declined due to dealership closures and consolidations as a result of industry dynamics and macroeconomic issues. When dealers consolidate, the services they previously purchased separately are often purchased by the combined entity in a lesser quantity or for a lower aggregate price than before, leading to volume compression and loss of revenue. Further dealership consolidations or closures could reduce the aggregate demand for our products and services. In addition, further proliferation of automotive manufacturer direct-to-consumer sales models could result in a decline in the number of U.S. dealers and consolidation in buying power. If dealership closures and consolidations occur in the future, our business and financial results would be materially and adversely affected.

If we fail to maintain or increase the number of dealers that pay subscription fees to us, or fail to maintain or increase the fees paid to us for subscriptions, our business and financial results would be materially and adversely affected.

If paying dealers do not receive the volume of consumer connections that they expect during their subscription period, do not experience the level of car sales they expect from those connections, or fail to attribute consumer connections or sales to our platform, they may terminate their subscriptions prior to the commencement of the applicable renewal term. If we fail to maintain or increase the number of paying dealers or fail to maintain or increase the level of fees that we receive from them, our business and financial results would be materially and adversely affected.

We allow dealers to list their inventory in our marketplaces for free; however, we impose certain limitations on such free listings. In the future, we may decide to impose additional restrictions on Restricted Listings or modify the services available to non-paying dealers. These changes to our Restricted Listings product may result in less inventory being displayed to consumers, which may impair our efforts to attract consumers, and cause paying and non-paying dealers to receive fewer leads and connections, which may make it more difficult for us to convert non-paying dealers to paying dealers or maintain or increase the number of paying dealers. If dealers do not subscribe to our paid offerings at the rates we expect, our business and financial results would be materially and adversely affected.

Our business is subject to risks related to the larger automotive industry ecosystem, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.

Decreases in consumer demand could adversely affect the market for automobile purchases and, in turn, reduce the number of consumers using our platform. Consumer purchases of new and used automobiles generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. Purchases of new and used automobiles are typically discretionary for consumers and have been, and may continue to be, affected by negative trends, including:

•
energy costs;

•
the availability and cost of credit; 

•
increased interest rates; 

•
inflation; 

•
reductions in business and consumer confidence; 

•
stock market volatility;

•
unemployment levels;

•
government shutdowns, political unrest, or uncertainty; and

•
other global economic conditions. 

Further, in recent years the market for motor vehicles has experienced rapid changes in technology and consumer demands. Self-driving technology, ride sharing, transportation networks, and other fundamental changes in transportation could impact consumer demand for the purchase of automobiles. A reduction in the number of automobiles purchased by consumers could adversely affect dealers and car manufacturers and lead to a reduction in other spending by these groups, including targeted incentive programs. In addition, our business has been and may continue to be negatively affected by challenges to the larger automotive industry ecosystem, including:

20

Table of Contents

•
global supply chain challenges;

•
labor disruptions, work stoppages, or strikes;

•
economic instability;

•
changes in tax laws and regulations;

•
export controls; 

•
changes to trade policies, including higher tariff rates and customs duties;

•
economic sanctions and trade restrictions;

•
geopolitical tensions and military conflicts; and

•
other macroeconomic issues, including increased interest rates and inflation.

Both the availability and cost of credit are factors affecting consumer confidence, which is a critical driver of vehicle sales for our consumers and dealers. Additionally, vehicle affordability for our consumers is becoming more challenging due to a combination of factors, including elevated vehicle pricing resulting from inflationary cost increases and declines in inventory supply, rising vehicle finance costs due to increased interest rates, and rising auto insurance rates. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.

If the CarOffer business and/or our combined offerings do not grow, our revenue and business could be adversely affected.

Our Digital Wholesale segment revenue, which is comprised of wholesale revenue and product revenue, decreased $118.3 million, or 55%, in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, and represented 11% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 24% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. There can be no assurances that we will be able to increase the revenue attributable to our Digital Wholesale segment or whether such segment will be able to achieve profitable growth in the future. Our ability to grow our Digital Wholesale segment and the revenue associated with it depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:

•
expand the number of dealers engaging on the CarOffer platform;

•
retain existing customers and increase the share of wholesale transactions that they complete on the CarOffer platform;

•
attract prospective customers who have historically purchased or sold vehicles through physical auctions and may choose not to transact online; and

•
successfully compete with competitors, including other online vehicle auction companies and large, national offline vehicle auction companies that are expanding into the online channel and have launched online auctions in connection with their physical auctions.

Additionally, our ability to grow Instant Max Cash Offer and the revenue associated with it depends on a number of factors, including our ability to effectively scale and market Instant Max Cash Offer; attract consumers to sell their vehicles online through Instant Max Cash Offer; and successfully compete with competitors, including online dealerships. If our anticipated transaction synergies do not fully materialize, or the CarOffer business and/or Instant Max Cash Offer fail to grow at the rate we expect, our revenue and business could be adversely affected.

While we have taken actions intended to improve the operational efficiency at CarOffer and to capitalize on synergies between the CarOffer platform and our other businesses, there are no assurances that we will be able to improve the performance of our CarOffer platform or increase the revenue derived from our Digital Wholesale segment.

Industry conditions such as a significant change in retail vehicle prices or a decline in the used vehicle inventory supply coming to the wholesale market could also adversely impact CarOffer’s business and growth. For example, if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles, it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to consumers than buying a used vehicle, which could result in reduced used vehicle wholesale sales on the CarOffer platform. Used vehicle dealers may also decide to retail more of their vehicles, which could adversely impact the volume of vehicles offered for sale on the CarOffer platform. In addition, the decline in the supply of inventory and increase in the cost of financing have, among other factors, led to an increase in wholesale

21

Table of Contents

auction prices and the prices that dealers charge consumers for automobiles. We also face inventory risk in connection with vehicles acquired by CarOffer via arbitration, including the risk of inventory obsolescence, a decline in values, and significant inventory write-downs or write-offs, as well as increased costs associated with the arbitration process. Such inventory risk and costs would be higher if arbitrations increase, which is more likely to occur in connection with declining wholesale market conditions.

Furthermore, activity on the CarOffer platform has in the past fluctuated, and may again in the future fluctuate, from period to period based on macroeconomic conditions and changing demand requirements, which could adversely impact our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition for such period(s). Macroeconomic issues, including increased interest rates and lower consumer confidence, could also adversely impact dealer demand for sourcing inventory and, therefore, lead to a reduction in the number of vehicle wholesale sales on the CarOffer platform and/or transacted via Instant Max Cash Offer, which would adversely impact CarOffer’s business and financial results. Additionally, inventory challenges in the automotive industry have contributed and could continue to contribute to a decrease in the supply of vehicles coming to the wholesale market and reduce the number of vehicles sold on the CarOffer platform and/or transacted via Instant Max Cash Offer. An inability by CarOffer to retain customers and/or increase or find alternative sources of vehicle supply could adversely impact our revenue and business.

We may fail to successfully integrate CarOffer and/or fail to fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, which could harm our business, brands, operating results, and financial condition.

On December 1, 2023, we completed our acquisition of the remaining minority equity interests in CarOffer, or the 2023 CarOffer Transaction. Successful integration of CarOffer’s operations and personnel into our existing operations places an additional burden on management and other internal resources. The integration process could distract our management, disrupt our ongoing business, or result in inconsistencies in our services, standards, controls, procedures, and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, which could, in turn, harm our business, brands, operating results, and financial condition.

If dealers or other advertisers reduce their spending with us, our advertising revenue and business and our financial results would be harmed.

A portion of our revenue is derived from advertising revenue generated primarily through short-term advertising sales, including on-site advertising and audience targeting services, to dealers, auto manufacturers, and other auto-related brand advertisers as well as non-endemic programmatic advertisers. We compete for this advertising revenue with other online automotive marketplaces and with traditional media, such as television, radio, magazines, newspapers, automotive publications, billboards, and other offline advertising channels. Our ability to attract and retain advertisers and to generate advertising revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:

•
increase the number of consumers using our marketplaces;

•
compete effectively for advertising spending with other online automotive marketplaces;

•
continue to develop our advertising products;

•
keep pace with changes in technology and the practices and offerings of our competitors, including the use of AI;

•
keep pace with changes to data privacy regulations as well as the implementation of consent mechanisms to support the changing regulatory landscape; and

•
offer an attractive ROI to our advertisers for their advertising spend with us. 

It is possible that advertising customers will cancel or reduce their advertising with us for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic issues, such as increased interest rates and other matters that influence consumer spending. In addition, a decline in the number of consumer visits to our sites could have an adverse impact on our advertising revenue. We may not succeed in capturing a greater share of our advertisers’ spending if we are unable to convince advertisers of the effectiveness or superiority of our advertising offerings as compared to alternative channels. If current advertisers reduce their advertising spending with us and we are unable to replace such reduced advertising spending, our advertising revenue and business and financial results would be harmed.

If we are unable to provide a compelling experience to consumers on our marketplaces, connections between consumers and dealers using our marketplaces may decline and our business and financial results would be materially and adversely affected.

If we are unable to provide a compelling experience to consumers on our marketplaces, the number of connections between consumers and dealers using our marketplaces may decline, which, in turn, could lead dealers to stop listing their inventory in our marketplaces, cancel their subscriptions, or reduce their spending with us. If dealers pause or cancel listing their inventory in our marketplaces, we may not be able to attract a large consumer audience, which may cause other dealers to pause or cancel their use of our marketplaces. This reduction in the amount of inventory available on our marketplaces would materially and adversely affect our business and financial results. Our ability to provide a compelling consumer experience, both on desktop computers and through mobile devices, is subject to a number of factors, including our ability to:

•
maintain attractive marketplaces for consumers and dealers;

•
continue to innovate and introduce products for our marketplaces;

•
anticipate or adapt to new and changing technologies, including the use of AI, and consumer requirements on a timely basis;

•
launch new products that are effective and have a high degree of consumer engagement;

•
display a wide variety of automobile inventory to attract more consumers to our websites;

•
provide mobile applications that engage consumers;

•
maintain the compatibility of our mobile applications with operating systems and with mobile devices running such operating systems; and

•
access and analyze a sufficient amount of data to enable us to provide relevant information to consumers, including pricing information and accurate vehicle details. 

Any inability by us to develop new products, adapt to new technologies, or achieve widespread consumer and dealer adoption of those products could negatively impact our business and financial results.

Our success depends on our continued innovation to provide products that make our marketplaces, websites, and mobile applications useful for consumers and dealers or that otherwise provide value to consumers and dealers, including, for example, features of vehicle listing, research, search, and transactional offerings. A failure by us to capture the benefits that we expect from these product investments could negatively impact our business and financial results.

We also anticipate that over time our investments in our current products may become less productive and the growth of our revenue will require more focus on developing new products. These new products must be widely adopted by consumers and dealers in order for us to continue to attract consumers to our marketplaces and dealers to our products and services. Accordingly, we must continually invest resources in product, technology, and development to improve the attractiveness of our marketplaces and adapt to new and changing technologies and consumer requirements. Our ability to engage in these activities may decline as a result of macroeconomic factors and any cost-savings initiatives on our business. These product, technology, and development expenses may include costs of hiring additional personnel and retaining our current employees, engaging third-party service providers, and conducting other research and development activities. There can be no assurance that innovations to our products, like Instant Max Cash Offer or Top Dealer Offers, or the development of future products, will increase consumer or dealer engagement, achieve market acceptance, create additional revenue, or become profitable. There can also be no assurance that our future products will meet consumer expectations in light of new technologies offered by others in the marketplace.

In addition, revenue relating to new products is typically unpredictable and our new products may have lower gross margins, lower retention rates, and higher marketing and sales costs than our existing products. We are likely to continue to modify our pricing models for both existing and new products so that our prices for our offerings reflect the value those offerings are providing to consumers and dealers. Our pricing models may not effectively reflect the value of products to dealers and if we are unable to provide marketplaces and products that consumers and dealers want to use, they may reduce or cease the use of our marketplaces and products. Without innovative marketplaces and related products, we may be unable to attract additional, unique consumers or retain current consumers, which could affect the number of dealers that become paying dealers and the number of advertisers that want to

advertise in our marketplaces as well as the amounts that they are willing to pay for our products, which could, in turn, negatively impact our business and financial results.

We rely, in part, on internet search engines to drive traffic to our websites, and if we fail to appear prominently in the search results, our traffic would decline and our business would be adversely affected.

We rely, in part, on internet search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo! to drive traffic to our websites. The number of consumers we attract to our marketplaces from search engines is due in part to how and where our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, when a consumer searches for a vehicle in an internet search engine, we rely on a high organic search ranking of our webpages to refer the consumer to our websites. Our competitors’ internet search engine optimization efforts may result in their websites receiving higher search result rankings than ours, or internet search engines could change their methodologies and/or introduce competing products in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings. If internet search engines modify their methodologies in ways that are detrimental to us, as they have done from time to time, or if our efforts to improve our search engine optimization are unsuccessful or less successful than our competitors’ efforts, our ability to attract a large consumer audience could diminish, traffic to our marketplaces could decline, and the number of leads that we send to our dealers could be adversely impacted. Additionally, competing products from internet search engine providers, such as those that provide dealer and vehicle pricing and other information directly in search results or decreases in consumer use of search engines, for example, as a result of the continued development of AI technology, could also adversely impact traffic to our websites and the number of leads that we are able to send to our dealers. Our business would also be adversely affected if internet search engine providers choose to align with our competitors. Reductions in our own search advertising spend, more aggressive spending by our competitors, or increased costs from internet search engines could cause us to incur higher advertising costs and/or reduce our market visibility to prospective users, which could, in turn, adversely impact our ability to attract a large consumer audience, the amount of traffic to our marketplaces, and the number of leads that we send to our dealers. Our websites have experienced fluctuations in organic and paid search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of consumers directed to our websites through internet search engines would harm our business and operating results.

We may be unable to maintain or grow relationships with data providers, or may experience interruptions in the data they provide, which may create a less valuable or transparent shopping experience and negatively affect our business and operating results.

We obtain data from many third-party data providers, including inventory management systems, automotive website providers, customer relationship management systems, dealer management systems, governmental entities, and third-party data brokers or licensors. Our business relies on our ability to obtain data for the benefit of consumers and dealers using our marketplaces and ourselves. For example, our success in each market is dependent in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain inventory data and other vehicle information for those markets. The loss or interruption of such inventory data or other vehicle information could decrease the number of consumers and dealers using our marketplaces. We could experience interruptions in our data access for a number of reasons, including difficulties in renewing our agreements with data providers, changes to the software used by data providers, efforts by industry participants to restrict access to data, and increased fees we may be charged by data providers. Our marketplaces could be negatively affected if any current provider terminates its relationship with us or our service from any provider is interrupted. If there is a material disruption in the data provided to us, the information that we provide to consumers and dealers using our marketplaces may be limited. In addition, the quality, accuracy, and timeliness of this information may suffer, which may lead to a less valuable or transparent shopping experience for consumers using our marketplaces and could negatively affect our business and operating results.

The failure to build, maintain, and protect our brands would harm our ability to attract a large consumer audience and to expand the use of our marketplaces by consumers and dealers.

Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on the success of our efforts to maintain the trust of consumers and dealers and to deliver value to each consumer and dealer using our marketplaces. Our ability to protect our brands is also impacted by the success of our efforts to optimize our significant brand spend and overcome the intense competition in brand marketing across our industry, including competitors that may imitate our messaging. In addition, we have reduced our brand spend in comparison to our pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, and it is possible that we may in the future decide to further reduce such spend depending on macroeconomic conditions. If consumers believe that we are not focused on providing them with a better automobile shopping

experience, or if we fail to overcome brand marketing competition and maintain a differentiated value proposition in consumers’ minds, our reputation and the strength of our brands may be adversely affected.

Complaints or negative publicity about our business practices and culture, our management team and employees, our marketing and advertising campaigns, our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the integrity of the data that we provide to consumers, data privacy and security issues, third party content and conduct on our websites, and other aspects of our business, irrespective of their validity, could diminish consumers’ and dealers’ confidence and participation in our marketplaces and could adversely affect our brands. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance our brands, and failure to do so would harm our business and operating results.

Our future revenue is uncertain, including due to potential macroeconomic effects, including financial market volatility and disruption, inflationary concerns, changes in tax laws and regulations, interest and currency exchange rates, uncertain economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, and additional tariffs, including as a result of the recent U.S. presidential election.

Our revenue decreased to $894.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, from $914.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a 2% decrease between such periods. Our future revenue is uncertain and could potentially be impacted by macroeconomic issues, including:

•
declining wholesale vehicle prices;

•
reductions in business and consumer confidence;

•
labor disruptions, work stoppages, or strikes;

•
unemployment levels;

•
consumer debt levels;

•
financial market volatility and disruption;

•
inflationary concerns;

•
changes in tax laws and regulations; 

•
interest and currency exchange rates; 

•
uncertain economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad;

•
additional tariffs, including as a result of on the recent U.S. presidential election;

•
export controls;

•
geopolitical events;

•
economic sanctions and trade restrictions; and 

•
other matters that influence consumer spending and preferences as well as changes to the regulatory landscape. 

We will also not be able to grow as expected, or at all, if we fail to:

•
increase the number of consumers using our marketplaces;

•
maintain and expand the number of dealers that subscribe to our marketplaces and maintain and increase the fees that they are paying;

•
expand the number of dealers engaging on the CarOffer platform and increase the share of wholesale transactions which they complete on such platform;

•
attract and retain advertisers placing advertisements in our marketplaces;

•
attract new consumers to sell their vehicles online through Instant Max Cash Offer;

•
further improve the quality of our marketplaces and introduce high quality new products; and

•
increase the number of connections between consumers and dealers using our marketplaces and connections to paying dealers.

If our revenue declines or fails to grow, investors’ perceptions of our business may be adversely affected, and the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.

We may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or if capital is not available to us, our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows, we would require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances, including the effects of macroeconomic issues, as well as to make marketing expenditures to improve our brand awareness, develop new products, further improve our platform and existing products, enhance our operating infrastructure, and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. We may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds, in addition to our revolving credit facility associated with the Credit Agreement (as defined below), which we refer to as the 2022 Revolver. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Volatility in the equity and credit markets, including heightened inflation and interest rate and currency rate fluctuation, may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain equity or debt financing. An inability to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it could significantly limit our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances and could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.

Our international operations involve risks that may differ from, or are in addition to, our domestic operational risks.

In addition to the U.S., we operate marketplaces in the U.K. and Canada, which are less familiar competitive environments and involve various risks, including the need to invest significant resources and the likelihood that returns on such investments will not be achieved for several years, or possibly at all. We have incurred losses in prior periods in the U.K. and Canada and may incur losses there again in the future. We also face various other challenges in those jurisdictions. Our competitors may be more established or otherwise better positioned than we are to succeed in the U.K. and Canada. Our competitors may offer services to dealers that make dealers dependent on them, such as hosting dealers’ websites and providing inventory feeds for dealers, which would make it difficult to attract dealers to our marketplaces. Any of these barriers could impede our operations in our international markets, which could affect our business and potential growth.

Our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources, and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a business in an environment of multiple cultures, customs, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute resolution systems, and commercial infrastructures. Operating internationally may subject us to different risks or increase our exposure in connection with current risks, including:

•
adapting our websites, mobile applications, and services to conform to local consumer behavior;

•
increased competition from local providers and potential preferences by local populations for local providers;

•
compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, including different privacy, consumer, financial, censorship, and liability standards and regulations and different intellectual property laws;

•
the enforceability of our intellectual property rights;

•
credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;

•
compliance with anti-bribery laws, including compliance with currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•
adverse changes in trade relationships among foreign countries and/or between the U.S. and such countries (which could result in the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs, or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the U.S. or countries that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business);

•
double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences arising from the tax laws of the U.S. or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate; and

26

•
higher costs of doing business internationally. 

Our goodwill, intangible assets, and other assets have been subject to impairment in the past and may be subject to further impairment in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or future operating results.

We evaluate the recoverability of recognized goodwill, intangible assets, and other assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These impairment tests are based on several factors requiring management’s judgment, including identification of triggering events for reassessment and determination of the fair value of related assets. If such goodwill, intangible assets, or other assets are deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the asset group’s carrying value exceeds the fair value of the net assets would be recognized. Future events may cause impairments of our goodwill, intangible assets, or other assets based on factors such as the price of our Class A common stock, projected cash flows, assumptions used, operational challenges, or other variables. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, or other assets.

In the three months ended June 30, 2024, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $127.5 million related to the CarOffer reporting unit. If we determine that there has been a further impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets, or other assets related to the CarOffer reporting unit or there has been an impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, or other assets, we may be required to record additional charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or future operating results.

We depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract, and integrate highly qualified personnel, or if we experience turnover of our key personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be materially and adversely affected.

We believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. We have encountered intense competition for retaining and attracting highly qualified and skilled employees. Retaining highly qualified personnel can be influenced by external market conditions, employee well-being, our employer reputation, and competitive poaching. Accordingly, we have incurred, and we may continue to incur, significant costs to attract new employees and retain existing ones, and we may in the future become less competitive in attracting and retaining employees as a result of any expense reduction efforts that we may initiate. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, any unplanned turnover, reduced involvement, or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for any of our executive officers or key employees, or the reduction in their involvement in the management of our business, could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. Our executive officers and other employees are at-will, which means they may terminate their employment relationships with us at any time. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. Furthermore, changes in our senior management team and other key employees have the potential to disrupt our business, and any such disruption could adversely affect our operations, growth, financial condition, or results of operations.

We may be subject to disputes regarding the accuracy of IMV, Deal Ratings, Dealer Ratings, New Car Price Information, and other features of our marketplaces.

We provide consumers using our CarGurus platform and dealers using our CarGurus and CarOffer platforms with our proprietary IMV, Deal Ratings, and Dealer Ratings as well as other data insights and features to help them evaluate vehicle pricing, including New Car Price Information. Our valuation models depend on the inventory listed on our websites as well as information regarding automotive sales. If the inventory on our websites declines significantly, if the number of automotive sales declines significantly, or if used car sales prices become volatile, whether as a result of macroeconomic effects or otherwise, our valuation models may not perform as expected. Revisions to or errors in our automated valuation models, or the algorithms that underlie them, may cause the IMV, the Deal Rating, New Car Price Information, or other features to vary from our expectations regarding the accuracy of these tools. In addition, from time to time, regulators, consumers, dealers, and other industry participants may question or disagree with our IMV, Deal Rating, Dealer Rating, or New Car Price Information. Any such questions or disagreements could result in distraction from our

27

Table of Contents

business or potentially harm our reputation, could result in a decline in consumers’ confidence in, or use of, our marketplaces, and could result in legal disputes.

We are subject to a complex framework of laws and regulations, many of which are unsettled, still developing, and contradictory, which have in the past, and could in the future, subject us to claims, challenge our business model, or otherwise harm our business.

Various aspects of our business are, may become, or may be viewed by regulators from time to time as subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations and to foreign laws and regulations.

Local Motor Vehicle Sales, Advertising and Brokering, and Consumer Protection Laws

The advertising and sale of new and used motor vehicles is highly regulated by the jurisdictions in which we do business. Regulatory authorities or third parties could take the position that some of the laws or regulations applicable to dealers or to the manner in which motor vehicles are advertised and sold generally are directly applicable to certain aspects of our business. If our marketplaces and related products are determined to not comply with relevant regulatory requirements, we or dealers could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class actions or other civil litigation, as well as orders interfering with our ability to continue providing our marketplaces and related products and services in certain jurisdictions. In addition, even absent such a determination, to the extent dealers are uncertain about the applicability of such laws and regulations to our business, we may lose or have difficulty increasing the number of paying dealers, which would affect our future growth.

If regulators or other third parties take the position that our marketplaces or related products violate applicable dealer licensing, brokering, bird-dog, consumer protection, consumer finance, or advertising laws or regulations, responding to such allegations could be costly, could require us to pay significant sums in settlements, could require us to pay civil and criminal penalties, including fines, could interfere with our ability to continue providing our marketplaces and related products in certain jurisdictions, or could require us to make adjustments to our marketplaces and related products or the manner in which we derive revenue from dealers using our platform, any or all of which could result in substantial adverse publicity, termination of subscriptions by dealers, decreased revenue, distraction for our employees, increased expenses, and decreased profitability.

Federal Laws and Regulations

The Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, has the authority to take actions to remedy or prevent acts or practices that it considers to be unfair or deceptive and that affect commerce in the U.S. If the FTC or any other state regulatory body takes the position in the future that any aspect of our business, including our advertising and privacy practices, constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice, responding to such allegations could require us to defend our practices and pay significant damages, settlements, and civil penalties, or could require us to make adjustments to our marketplaces and related products and services, any or all of which could result in substantial adverse publicity, distraction for our employees, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability.

Our platforms enable us, dealers, and users to send and receive text messages and other mobile phone communications. The TCPA, as interpreted and implemented by the FCC and federal and state courts, impose significant restrictions on utilization of telephone calls and text messages to residential and mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, particularly if the prior express consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. Violations of the TCPA may be enforced by the FCC, by state attorneys general, or by others through litigation, including class actions. Furthermore, several provisions of the TCPA, as well as applicable rules and orders, are open to multiple interpretations and compliance may involve fact-specific analyses.

Any failure by us, or the third parties on which we rely, to follow, or successfully implement, appropriate processes and procedures in response to existing or future laws and regulations could result in legal and monetary liability, fines, and penalties or damage to our reputation in the marketplace, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if the claims are meritless, we may be required to expend resources and pay costs to defend against regulatory actions or third-party claims. Additionally, any change to applicable laws or their interpretations that further restricts the way consumers and dealers interact through our platforms, or any governmental or private enforcement actions related thereto, could adversely affect our ability to attract customers and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

28

Table of Contents

Antitrust and Other Laws

Antitrust and competition laws prohibit, among other things, any joint conduct among competitors that would lessen competition in the marketplace. A governmental or private civil action alleging unlawful or anticompetitive activity could be costly to defend and could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

Claims could be made against us under both U.S. and foreign laws, including claims for defamation, libel, privacy violations, false advertising, unfair trade or deceptive practices, or intellectual property infringement, or claims based on other theories related to the nature and content of the materials disseminated by our marketplaces and on portions of our websites. Our defense against any of these actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources. If we become liable for information transmitted in our marketplaces, we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability.

The foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to continuous change. We are, and we will continue to be, exposed to legal and regulatory risks including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, intellectual property, competition, and other matters. The enactment of new laws and regulations or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, both domestically and internationally, may affect the operation of our business, directly or indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, adverse publicity, loss of subscribing dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability. Further, investigations by federal and state governmental agencies, including the FTC, into allegedly anticompetitive, unfair, deceptive or other business practices by us or dealers using our marketplaces, or state attorney general offices combining resources to investigate state privacy law violations, could cause us to incur additional expenses and, if adversely concluded, could result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and significant legal liability, or orders requiring us to make adjustments to our marketplaces and related products and services.

We rely on third-party service providers and strategic partners for many aspects of our business, and any failure to maintain these relationships or to successfully integrate certain third-party platforms could harm our business.

Our success depends upon our relationships with third parties, including our transaction processor; our data center hosts; our information technology providers; our data providers for inventory and vehicle information; our advertising serving platforms; and our partners for vehicle transportation, inspection, and other logistics associated with our CarOffer business and Instant Max Cash Offer. If these third parties experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards, have adverse audit results, violate the terms of our agreements or applicable law, fail to obtain or maintain applicable licenses, or if the relationships we have established with such third parties expire or otherwise terminate, it could make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business, which could damage our business and reputation. In addition, if such third-party service providers or strategic partners were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, face financial distress or other business disruptions, or increase their fees or if our relationships with these providers or partners deteriorate or terminate, whether as a result of macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, we could suffer increased costs and we may be unable to provide similar services until an equivalent provider could be found or we could develop replacement technology or operations. For example, primarily in connection with the purchase and sale of vehicles between dealers, or Dealer-to-Dealer transactions, we utilize a single third-party transaction processor that collects customer payments on our behalf and remits them to us, provides payments in advance for certain selling dealers, provides titling services for transactions, and holds auction licenses. If our relationship with this third-party transaction processor were to deteriorate or terminate, we would have to identify a succeeding transaction processor or assume in-house facilitation of these services, which would disrupt our business and could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, if we are unsuccessful in identifying or finding high-quality partners, if we fail to negotiate cost-effective relationships with them, or if we ineffectively manage these relationships, it could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.

Our enterprise systems require that we integrate the platforms hosted by certain third-party service providers. We are responsible for integrating these platforms and updating them to maintain proper functionality. Issues with these integrations, our failure to properly update third-party platforms, or any interruptions to our internal enterprise systems could harm our business by causing delays in our ability to quote, activate service, maintain service, and bill new and existing customers on our platform.

A significant disruption in service on our websites or mobile applications could damage our reputation and result in a loss of consumers, which could harm our business, brands, operating results, and financial condition.

Our brands, reputation, and ability to attract consumers, dealers, and advertisers depend on the reliable performance of our technology infrastructure and content delivery. We have experienced, and we may in the future experience, interruptions with our systems. Interruptions in these systems could affect the security or availability of our marketplaces, and prevent or inhibit the ability of dealers and consumers to access our marketplaces. For example, past disruptions have impacted our ability to activate customer accounts and manage our billing activities in a timely manner. Such interruptions have resulted, and may in the future result, in third parties accessing our confidential and proprietary information, including our intellectual property. Problems with the reliability or security of our systems could harm our reputation, harm our ability to protect our confidential and proprietary information, result in a loss of consumers and dealers, and result in additional costs.

Substantially all of the communications, network, and computer hardware used to operate our platforms is located in the Eastern region of the U.S., and internationally near each of London, England; Dublin, Ireland; and Frankfurt, Germany. These facilities include hosting through Amazon Web Services, a provider of cloud infrastructure services. Although we can host our U.S. CarGurus’ marketplace from two alternative locations and we believe our systems are redundant, there may be exceptions for certain hardware or software. In addition, we do not own or control the operation of these facilities. Any disruptions or other operational performance problems with these facilities or problems faced by their operators, including our cloud infrastructure service provider, could result in material interruptions in our services, adversely affect our reputation and results of operations, and subject us to liability. We also use third-party hosting services to back up some data but do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of the services. A disruption to one or more of these systems has caused, and may in the future cause, us to experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with consumers, customers, and advertisers. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, extreme weather conditions, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic breaches, cyber-attacks, phishing attempts, errors by employees, physical break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes, and similar events. The occurrence of any of these events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail. In addition, we may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in certain circumstances.

Any errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance or reliability problems with our network operations could cause interruptions in access to our marketplaces as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services and fixing or replacing any affected systems or hardware and could harm our reputation, business, brands, operating results, and financial condition. Although we carry insurance, it may not be sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, including the potential harm to the future growth of our business, that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.

We and our third-party service providers collect, process, store, transfer, share, disclose, and use consumer information and other data, and the actual or perceived failure of us or our third-party service providers to protect such information and data or respect users’ privacy could expose us to liability and adversely affect our reputation, brands, business, and operating results.

Some functions of our marketplaces involve the storage and transmission of consumers’ information, such as IP addresses and site activity data, contact information of users who connect with dealers, credit applications, and other financial data and profile information of users who create accounts on our marketplaces as well as dealers’ information. We also process and store personal and confidential information of our vendors, partners, and employees, and we employ third-party service providers, such as payment processing providers, who also regularly have access to customer and consumer data. Some of this information may be sensitive, and any cybersecurity attack, data breach, or other security incident impacting such information, including the unauthorized acquisition or access, compromise, or loss of such information, against us or our third-party service providers could expose us to a risk of loss or exposure of this information, which could result in potential liability, litigation (including class action litigation) or regulatory action, and remediation costs. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to effect secure transmission of such information, and we also rely on our third-party service providers to use sufficient security measures to protect such information. Despite all of our efforts designed to protect this information, none of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers provide absolute security, and they may not be effective in preventing a future failure of our systems. Like all information systems and technology, our websites, mobile applications, and information systems, and those of our third-party service providers, are subject to computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks, attempts to overload the systems with denial-of-service or other attacks, ransomware, and similar incidents or disruptions from unauthorized use of our or our third-party service providers’

systems, any of which could lead to interruptions, delays, or website shutdowns, and could cause loss of critical data and the unauthorized disclosure, access, acquisition, alteration, or use of personal or other confidential information. If we or our third-party service providers experience compromises to data security that result in website or mobile application performance or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our websites or mobile applications, or the loss or unauthorized disclosure, access, acquisition, alteration, or use of confidential information, consumers, customers, advertisers, partners, vendors, and employees may lose trust and confidence in us, and consumers may decrease the use of our websites or stop using our websites entirely, dealers may stop or decrease their subscriptions with us, and advertisers may decrease or stop advertising on our websites.

Further, outside parties have attempted and will likely continue to attempt to fraudulently induce employees, consumers, or advertisers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our information or our information of consumers, dealers, advertisers, and employees. As cyber-attacks increase in frequency and sophistication, our cyber-security and disaster recovery plans may not be effective in anticipating, preventing, and effectively responding to all potential cyber-risk exposures. In addition, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service or sabotage systems constantly evolve, often are not recognized until after having been launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate measures for prevention and detection. For example, as AI continues to evolve, cybercriminals could also use AI to develop malicious code and sophisticated phishing attempts.

Any or all of the issues above could adversely affect our brand reputation, negatively impact our ability to attract new consumers, and increase engagement by existing consumers, cause existing consumers to reduce or stop the use of our marketplaces or close their accounts, cause existing dealers and advertisers to cancel their contracts, cause employees to terminate their employment, cause employment candidates to be unwilling to pursue employment opportunities or accept employment offers, and/or subject us to governmental or third-party lawsuits, investigations, regulatory fines, or other actions or liability, thereby harming our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although we carry privacy, data breach, and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all.

There are numerous federal, national, state, and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and around the world regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use, cross-border transfer, and protection of personal information and other data. These laws and regulations are evolving, are subject to differing interpretations, may be costly to comply with, may result in regulatory fines, penalties, or on-going monitoring, may subject us to investigations and/or third-party lawsuits, may be inconsistent between countries and state-level jurisdictions, and may conflict with other requirements. We seek to comply with applicable industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties, as well as all applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection. However, given the recency of these laws and the lack of enforcement examples so far, especially in the U.S., it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices and that new regulations could be enacted. Several proposals have recently become effective or are pending, as applicable, before federal, state, local, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies that could significantly affect our business, which we refer to collectively as the Privacy Regulations. The Privacy Regulations include the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Protection Act, and an additional 18 separate U.S. state consumer privacy laws that are currently in effect or will be going into effect over the next year (Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia). Certain of the Privacy Regulations have already required, and certain others may further require, us to change our policies and procedures and may in the future require us to make changes to our marketplaces and other products. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our marketplaces and other offerings, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, and restrict our ability to store, transfer, and process data, which may seriously harm our business. Similarly, the gradual industry shift away from relying on third-party cookies may require us to change our policies and procedures and, if we are not in compliance, may also seriously harm our business. We may not be entirely successful in our efforts to effectively transition away from third-party cookies as well as comply with the evolving regulations to which we are subject due to various factors within our control, such as limited internal resource allocation, or outside our control, such as a lack of vendor cooperation, new regulatory interpretations, or lack of regulatory guidance in respect of certain Privacy Regulations and other statutory requirements.

Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations, our privacy policies, or our privacy-related obligations to consumers, customers, employees, and other third parties, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of data, which could include personal information or other user data, may result in governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, criminal penalties, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others, and could cause consumers and dealers to lose trust in us, which could significantly impact our brand reputation and have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if any third party that we share information with experiences a security breach or fails to comply with its privacy-related legal obligations or commitments to us, such matters may put employee, consumer, or dealer information at risk and could, in turn, expose us to claims for damages, regulatory fines, penalties, or litigation and harm our reputation, business, and operating results.

Our ability to attract consumers to our websites and to provide certain services to our customers depends on the collection of consumer data from various sources, which may be restricted by consumer choice, privacy restrictions, and developments in laws, regulations, and industry standards.

The success of our on-site monetization efforts, consumer marketing, and the delivery of digital advertisements for our customers depends on our ability to leverage data, including data that we collect from our customers, data we receive from our publisher partners and third parties, and data from our operations. Using cookies and non-cookie technologies, such as mobile advertising identifiers, we collect information about the interactions of users with our customers’ and publishers’ digital properties (including, for example, information about the placement of advertisements and users’ shopping or other interactions with our customers’ websites or advertisements). Our ability to successfully leverage such data depends on our continued ability to access and use such data, which could be restricted by a number of factors, including:

•
increasing consumer adoption of browser preference signals as a result of legislation; 

•
privacy restrictions imposed by web browser developers, advertising partners, or other software developers that impair our ability to understand the preferences of consumers by limiting the use of third-party cookies or other tracking technologies or data indicating or predicting consumer preferences; and 

•
new developments in, or new interpretations of, privacy laws, regulations, and industry standards. 

Each of these developments could materially impact our ability to collect consumer data and deliver relevant digital advertisements to attract consumers to our websites or to deliver targeted advertising for our advertising customers. If we are unsuccessful in evolving our advertising and marketing strategies to adapt to and mitigate these evolving consumer data limitations, our business could be materially impacted.

We have been, and may again be, subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.

We have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and litigation alleging that we or content on our websites infringe others’ intellectual property rights, including the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors or non-practicing entities. We may also learn of possible infringement to our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property. Patent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict and may result in significant settlement costs or payment of substantial damages. We host third-party images on our website and mobile application and may be subject to third-party claims of those images infringing on intellectual property rights of third parties. Many potential litigants, including patent holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us to stop offering some features or prevents us from conducting our business as we have historically done or may desire to do in the future. We might also be required to seek a license and pay royalties for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to modify our marketplaces and features, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.

In addition, we use open source software in our platform and will use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims regarding ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license, or require us to devote additional product, technology, and development

32

resources to change our platforms or services, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. Even if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, our operating results, and our reputation.

Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our business and operating results.

Our business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements as we deem appropriate. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our platform’s features, software, and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary.

Competitors may adopt trademarks or trade names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims asserted against us by owners of other registered or unregistered trademarks logos or slogans, for our use of registered or unregistered trademarks, logos, or slogans or third-party trademarks that incorporate variations of our trademarks.

We currently hold various internet domain names relating to our brands. The regulation of domain names is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain all domain names that use the names of our brands. In addition, third parties have created and may in the future create copycat or squatter domains to deceive consumers, which could harm our brands, interfere with our ability to register domain names, and result in additional costs.

We may be unable to halt the operations of websites that aggregate or misappropriate our data.

From time to time, third parties may misappropriate our data through website crawling, website scraping, or other means and aggregate this data with data from other sources. In addition, copycat websites may misappropriate data in our marketplaces and attempt to imitate our brands or the functionality of our websites, or to use data from our marketplace to develop data analytics and insights. This activity may also interfere with the operation of our marketplace. We may be unable to detect and remedy all such activities in a timely and adequate manner. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against these third parties, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, to the extent that such activity creates confusion among consumers or advertisers, our brands and business could be harmed.

Seasonality and other factors may cause fluctuations in our operating results and our marketing spend.

Across the retail automotive industry, consumer purchasing activity is typically greatest in the first three quarters of each year, due in part to the introduction of new vehicle models from manufacturers and the seasonal nature of consumer spending, and our consumer-marketing spend generally fluctuates accordingly. In addition, any reduction of our marketing spend in response to macroeconomic-related expense management or otherwise, and shifts in demand from dealers and consumers could impact the efficiency of our marketing spend. As our growth rates moderate or cease, the impact of these seasonality trends and other influences on our results of operations could become more pronounced. This seasonality has affected the demand for our services in the past, and may continue to in the future. In addition, the volume of wholesale vehicle sales can fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of macroeconomic issues, which may have a corresponding impact on our results of operations. This variability is due to several factors including the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles, and/or inventory challenges in the automotive industry, which affect the demand side of the wholesale industry. This variability has affected our Digital Wholesale segment in the past, and may continue to in the future.

Failure to deal effectively with fraud or other illegal activity could harm our business.

We are exposed to potential fraudulent and illegal activity in our marketplaces, including listings of automobiles that are not owned by the purported dealer or that the dealer has no intention of selling at the listed price; and receipt of fraudulent leads that we may send to our dealers. The measures we have in place to detect and limit the occurrence of such fraudulent and illegal activity in our marketplaces may not always be effective or account for all types of fraudulent or other illegal activity now or in the future. Failure to

33

Table of Contents

limit the impact of fraudulent and illegal activity on our websites could lead to potential legal liability, harm our business, cause us to lose paying dealer customers, and adversely affect our reputation, financial performance, and growth prospects.

We have previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain effective internal control and remediate any future control deficiencies, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect our business and the market price of our Class A common stock.

We have previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which was subsequently remediated during the year ended December 31, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The deficiencies identified were in controls at our CarOffer subsidiary, including information technology general control deficiencies over certain information technology systems.

Although we have completed our remediation of the material weakness, if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. In addition, if we are unable to produce accurate consolidated financial statements in the future, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, and our ability to access the capital markets could be limited. Further, because of its inherent limitations, even our remediated and effective internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in our conditions, or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The 2022 Revolver contains certain covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.

The 2022 Revolver includes a number of covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, grant or incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make certain restricted investments or payments, enter into certain mergers and acquisitions, or engage in certain asset sales, subject in each case to certain exceptions. The 2022 Revolver also subjects us to financial covenants in respect of minimum liquidity and requires that we maintain a net leverage ratio. The 2022 Revolver may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. Complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies which are not subject to such restrictions. Further, interest rate fluctuations may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions due to the variable interest rate on the 2022 Revolver, in the event that we draw down funds thereunder.

A failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in the 2022 Revolver could result in an event of default, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments to provide loans under the 2022 Revolver and to declare any borrowings outstanding, together with any accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If any debt under the 2022 Revolver were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings and $9.9 million in letters of credit outstanding under the 2022 Revolver associated with our leases.

Expectations relating to environmental, social, and governance considerations expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on our business.

Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers, and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, considerations relating to our business, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human capital, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. We make statements about our ESG goals and initiatives through information provided on our website. Responding to these ESG considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and are impacted by factors that may be outside our control. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our ESG goals and initiatives and the focus of stakeholders may change and evolve over time.

34

Table of Contents

Stakeholders also may have very different views on where ESG focus should be placed, including differing views of regulators in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our ESG goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state, or international ESG laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. Additionally, meeting evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards may require management time and expense and may result in a significant increase in costs, which may negatively impact our business and financial results.

Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock

Our founder controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and, therefore, has control over key decision-making and could control our actions in a manner that conflicts with the interests of other stockholders.

Primarily by virtue of his holdings in shares of our Class B common stock, which has a ten-to-one voting ratio compared to our Class A common stock, Langley Steinert, our founder and Executive Chair, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and, therefore, has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock, which might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, Mr. Steinert has significant influence in the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as Executive Chair, and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors. As our Executive Chair, Mr. Steinert owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. If Mr. Steinert’s status as an officer and a director is terminated, his fiduciary duties to our stockholders will also terminate, but his voting power as a stockholder will not be reduced as a result of such termination unless such termination is either made voluntarily by Mr. Steinert or due to Mr. Steinert’s death, or if the sum of the number of shares of our capital stock held by Mr. Steinert, by any Family Member of Mr. Steinert and by any Permitted Entity of Mr. Steinert (as such capitalized terms are defined in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, included as Exhibit 3.1 to this Annual Report), assuming the exercise and settlement in full of all outstanding options and convertible securities and calculated on an as-converted to Class A common stock basis, is less than 9,091,484 shares. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Steinert is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be aligned with the interests of our other stockholders.

In the event that Mr. Steinert no longer controls a majority of the voting power, whether as a result of the disposition of some or all his shares of Class A or Class B common stock, the conversion of the Class B common stock into Class A common stock in accordance with its terms, or otherwise, our business or the trading price of our Class A common stock may be adversely affected.

The multiple class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our founder and certain other holders of our Class B common stock, which will limit or preclude the ability of our stockholders to influence corporate matters.

Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Our founder and certain of his affiliates hold a substantial number of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and, therefore, hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and, therefore, are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude the ability of our other stockholders to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. Additionally, transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those transferred shares converting into Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common stock has had and will continue to have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain such shares. If, for example, Mr. Steinert retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock, he could continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.

Our status as a “controlled company” could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm the trading price of our Class A common stock.

More than 50% of our voting power is held by Mr. Steinert. As a result, we are a “controlled company” under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies and may elect not to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements. We rely and have relied on certain or all of these exemptions. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.

The trading price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the value of our stockholders’ investment in our stock could decline.

The trading price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate substantially. The trading price of our Class A common stock depends on a number of factors, including those described in this “Risk Factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock include:

•
changes in the operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;

•
sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;

•
adverse changes to recommendations regarding our stock by covering securities analysts;

•
failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow us, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;

•
announcements by us or our competitors of new products;

•
the public’s reaction to our issuances of earnings guidance or other public announcements and filings;

•
real or perceived inaccuracies in our key metrics;

•
actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our operating results or developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;

•
litigation involving us or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;

•
developments or disputes concerning our proprietary rights;

•
announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;

•
new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;

•
changes in accounting standards, policies, or guidelines;

•
any significant change in our management;

•
changes in the automobile industry;

•
actions of an activist stockholder;

•
public health emergencies; and

•
general economic conditions. 

There can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase shares or that our share repurchase program will enhance stockholder value, and share repurchases could affect the price of our Class A common stock.

In November 2024 we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program, or the 2025 Share Repurchase Program, pursuant to which we may, from time to time, purchase shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $200.0 million, with an effective date of January 1, 2025, and an expiration date of December 31, 2025. Repurchases

36

Table of Contents

under the 2025 Share Repurchase Program may be made through a variety of methods and are subject to market and business conditions, levels of available liquidity, cash requirements for other purposes, and regulatory and other relevant factors. The timing, pricing, and size of share repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and general market and economic conditions. The 2025 Share Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any minimum dollar amount or number of shares, and may be suspended or discontinued by our Board of Directors at any time, which may result in a decrease in the price of our Class A common stock.

Repurchases under the 2025 Share Repurchase Program will decrease the number of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and, therefore, could affect the price of our Class A common stock and increase its volatility. The existence of the 2025 Share Repurchase Program could also cause the price of our Class A common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could reduce the market liquidity for our Class A common stock. Repurchases under the 2025 Share Repurchase Program will diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to further develop our business and service our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our Class A common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares. Any failure to repurchase shares after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our Class A common stock price. Although the 2025 Share Repurchase Program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness.

General Risk Factors

We participate in a highly competitive market, and pressure from existing and new companies may adversely affect our business and operating results.

We face significant competition from companies that provide listings, car-shopping information, lead generation, marketing, wholesale, and digital car-buying and -selling services designed to help consumers and dealers shop for cars and to enable dealers to reach these consumers. Our competitors include online automotive marketplaces and websites; internet search engines; peer-to-peer marketplaces; social media marketplaces; sites operated by automobile dealers and original equipment manufacturers; online dealerships; and vehicle auction companies. We compete with these and other companies for a share of dealers’ overall marketing budget for online and offline media marketing spend and we compete with these and other companies in attracting consumers to our websites. To the extent that dealers view alternative marketing and media strategies to be superior to our marketplaces, we may not be able to maintain or grow the number of dealers subscribing to, and advertising on, our marketplaces, and our business and financial results may be adversely affected. We also expect that new competitors will continue to enter the online automotive retail and wholesale industries with competing marketplaces, products, and services, and that existing competitors will expand to offer competing products or services, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.

Our competitors could significantly impede our ability to expand the number of dealers using our marketplaces or could offer discounts that could significantly impede our ability to maintain our pricing structure. Our competitors may also develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future platforms and associated products less competitive, unmarketable, or obsolete. In addition, if our competitors develop platforms with similar or superior functionality to ours, or if our web traffic declines, we may need to decrease our subscription and advertising fees. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing structure due to competitive pressures, our revenue would likely be reduced and our financial results would be negatively affected. Furthermore, our existing and potential competitors may have significantly more financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we have, which may allow them to offer more competitive pricing and the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and support of their marketplaces, products, and services. They may also have more extensive automotive industry relationships than we have, longer operating histories, and greater name recognition. In addition, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly with technological advances and to undertake more extensive marketing or promotional campaigns than we can. To the extent that any competitor has existing relationships with dealers or auto manufacturers for marketing or data analytics solutions, those dealers and auto manufacturers may be unwilling to partner with us. If we are unable to compete with these competitors, the demand for our marketplaces and related products and services could substantially decline.

In addition, our competitors may outpace us in incorporating technologies, such as AI, into their product offerings and engagement with customers, which could affect our competitiveness and operational outcomes. Our efforts to utilize these technological advancements may not be successful, may result in substantial integration and maintenance costs, and may expose us to additional risks. The content, analyses, or recommendations generated by AI products or services, if deficient, inaccurate, or biased, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operational results as well as our reputation. Moreover, ethical concerns

37

Table of Contents

associated with AI could lead to brand damage, competitive disadvantages, or legal repercussions. Any problems with our implementation or use of AI or other technological advancements could negatively impact our business or results of our operations.

We must maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock.

We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules adopted by the SEC, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, such as the previously identified material weakness discussed above, which was subsequently remediated during the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse to us in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed, or operating. We may not be able to remediate any future material weaknesses that may be identified or to complete our evaluation, testing, and required remediation in a timely fashion. Our compliance with Section 404 requires us to incur substantial accounting expenses and expend significant management efforts. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any future material weaknesses that may be identified, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.

We expect our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis.

Our revenue and results of operations could vary significantly from period to period as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including macroeconomic issues, such as increased interest rates and lower consumer confidence. Our results may vary as a result of fluctuations in the number of dealers subscribing to our marketplaces, the size and seasonal variability of our advertisers’ marketing budgets, and the impact of vehicle arbitrations, volume, and prices in a given period in connection with our Instant Max Cash Offer product and the wholesale sale of automobiles. As a result of the potential variations in our revenue and results of operations, period-to-period comparisons may not be meaningful and the results of any one period should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. In addition, our results of operations may not meet the expectations of investors or covering analysts, which may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock.

We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations, and interpretations, plus challenges to our tax positions.

We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate, which could include value added tax, excise tax, sales and use tax, gross receipts tax, and property tax. Changes in applicable tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations. There is also uncertainty over sales tax liability as a result of recent U.S. Supreme Court and Massachusetts Supreme Court decisions, which could precipitate reactions that could adversely increase our tax administrative costs and tax risk, and negatively affect our overall business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We are also regularly subject to audits by tax authorities. Any adverse development or outcome in connection with any such tax audits, and any other audits or litigation, could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

Our results could be adversely affected by events beyond our control, such as natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events.

Our operations, or those of third-party service providers or dealers, could be negatively impacted by various events beyond our control, including natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, extreme cold events, and other adverse weather conditions; public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; negative global climate patterns, especially in water stressed regions; or other catastrophic events, such as fires or other disasters. These events could disrupt our operations and those of our third-party service providers or dealers whether occurring in the U.S. or internationally. Further, if a natural disaster or catastrophic event occurs in a region in which a significant number of dealers are located, such dealers may suspend listing their inventory, cancel or delay their subscriptions, or reduce their spending with us, which may materially and adversely impact our results of operations for a particular period. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, the impacts of climate change could result in changes in regulations, which could, in turn, affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity.
We have policies, procedures, and processes for assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks, which are built into our overall information technology function and are designed to help protect our information assets and operations from internal and external cyber threats as well as secure our networks and systems. Such processes include procedural and technical safeguards, response plans, regular vulnerability and penetration tests on our systems and product applications, incident simulations, and routine review of our policies and procedures to identify risks and improve our practices. Our security incident response plan is designed to help coordinate our response to, and recovery from, cybersecurity incidents, and includes processes to assess the severity of, escalate, contain, investigate, and remediate incidents as well as to comply with applicable legal obligations. We maintain cyber insurance coverage; however, such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks, and other related breaches.
We 
engage
 certain external parties to enhance our cybersecurity processes and strategies. 
Depending on the nature of the services provided, the sensitivity and quantity of information processed, and the identity of the service provider, we evaluate the security and risk posture according to the perceived level of risk and in accordance with industry standard best practices.
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors provides direct oversight over cybersecurity risk and provides regular updates to our Board of Directors regarding such oversight.

The Audit Committee regularly meets with members of management responsible for data privacy, technology, and information security risks to discuss these risks, risk management activities, incident response plans, best practices, the effectiveness of our security measures, and other related matters.
Our Vice President, Information Security and Technology, who 
reports to 
our Chief Technology Officer
, leads the operational oversight of company-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards, and processes and works across relevant departments to assess and help prepare us and our employees to address cybersecurity risks.

Specific cybersecurity related responsibilities include overseeing our processes and strategies for the detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents.

Our Vice President, Information Security and Technology has extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity and risk programs having served in the current position for us since December 2020 and prior Senior Director level positions in security and privacy at several private and public Software as a Service, or SaaS, companies. Specialized knowledge also results from our Vice President, Information Security and Technology holding a Master of Information Security and Assurance from Norwich University.

In an effort to deter and detect cyber threats, we annually provide all employees, including part-time employees, with a data protection, cybersecurity, and incident response and prevention training program, which covers timely and relevant topics, including social engineering, phishing, password protection, confidential data protection, asset use, and mobile security, and educates employees on the importance of reporting all incidents immediately. We also use technology-based tools to mitigate cybersecurity threats and risks and to bolster our employee-based cybersecurity programs.
Despite our cybersecurity efforts, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us.
 See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report for a discussion of cybersecurity risks.

We do not own any material real property. Our principal executive office is located in Boston, Massachusetts, where we lease a total of 225,428 square feet of space with a lease term through 2039. We also lease office space in Addison, Texas, and Dublin, Ireland, for our CarOffer and European operations, respectively. Our U.S. Marketplace segment primarily utilizes the office in Boston, Massachusetts, and our Digital Wholesale segment primarily utilizes the office in Addison, Texas. The Other category of segment reporting utilizes the office in Dublin, Ireland. We believe that our current facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs. We believe that suitable additional space or substitute space will be available in the future to accommodate our operations as needed.
