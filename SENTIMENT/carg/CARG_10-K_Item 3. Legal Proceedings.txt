Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and our performance and future success, includes forward‑looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” You should review the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward‑looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by such cautionary statements.

In this discussion, we use financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures under SEC rules. These rules regarding non-GAAP financial measures require supplemental explanation and reconciliation, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from or in substitution for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.

This section of this Annual Report discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The period‑to‑period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.

Company Overview

CarGurus is a multinational, online automotive platform for buying and selling vehicles that is building upon its industry-leading listings marketplace with both digital retail solutions and the CarOffer online wholesale platform. The CarGurus platform gives consumers the confidence to purchase and/or sell a vehicle either online or in person, and it gives dealerships the power to accurately price, effectively market, instantly acquire, and quickly sell vehicles, all with a nationwide reach. We use proprietary technology, search algorithms, and data analytics to bring trust, transparency, and competitive pricing to the automotive shopping experience.

We operate the following marketplaces:

U.S., U.K., and Canada

U.S.

U.K.

CarOffer is a subsidiary of CarGurus and operates as an independent brand.

Autolist and PistonHeads operate as independent brands.

We have subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, and the U.K. and we have two reportable segments, U.S. Marketplace and Digital Wholesale. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further segment reporting and geographic information.

43

Table of Contents

We derive our revenue from marketplace revenue, wholesale revenue, and product revenue. Marketplace revenue is included in the U.S. Marketplace segment and Other category of segment reporting. Wholesale revenue and product revenue are primarily included in the Digital Wholesale segment. We generate marketplace revenue from (i) dealer subscriptions to our Listings packages and RPM, our digital advertising suite, Digital Retail, and Top Dealer Offers, (ii) advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto‑related brand advertisers, and (iii) revenue from partnerships with financing services companies. We generate wholesale revenue primarily from (x) transaction fees earned from Dealer-to-Dealer transactions, (y) transaction fees earned from the sale of vehicles to dealers that we acquire at other marketplaces, and (z) transaction fees earned from performing inspection and transportation services, inclusive of Dealer-to-Dealer transactions, other marketplace-to-dealer transactions, and Instant Max Cash Offer transactions (as defined below). We generate product revenue primarily from (A) aggregate proceeds received from the sale of vehicles to dealers that were acquired directly from customers, or Instant Max Cash Offer transactions, and (B) proceeds received from the sale of vehicles that were acquired through arbitration.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated revenue of $894.4 million, a 2% decrease from $914.2 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated consolidated net income of $21.0 million and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of $247.2 million, compared to consolidated net income of $22.1 million and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $195.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

See below for more information regarding our use and reconciliation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures.

Key Business Metrics

We regularly review a number of metrics, including the key metrics listed below, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make operating and strategic decisions. We believe it is important to evaluate these metrics, as applicable, for the U.S. and International geographic regions. The International region derives revenue from marketplace revenue from customers outside of the U.S. International markets perform differently from the U.S. market due to a variety of factors, including our operating history in each market, our rate of investment, market size, market maturity, competition, and other dynamics unique to each country.

Historically, we have used data from Google Universal Analytics, or Google Analytics, to measure two of our key business metrics: monthly unique users and monthly sessions. Effective July 1, 2024, Google Analytics 4, or GA4, replaced Google Analytics. The methodologies used in GA4 are different and not comparable to the methodologies used in Google Analytics. As discussed below, we also make certain adjustments to the GA4 data in order to improve the accuracy of the reported monthly unique users and monthly sessions. Due to the change in methodology, we are unable to provide comparable monthly unique user and monthly session information for prior periods, including any periods prior to June 30, 2024.

Monthly Unique Users

For each of our websites (excluding the CarOffer website), we define a monthly unique user as an individual who has visited any such website and taken a Visitor Action (as defined below) within a calendar month, based on data as measured by GA4. We calculate average monthly unique users as the sum of the monthly unique users of each of our websites in a defined period, divided by the number of months in that period. Effective July 1, 2024, we count a unique user the first time a computer or mobile device with a unique device identifier accesses any of our websites or application during a calendar month and takes an action on such website or in such application, such as performing a search, visiting vehicle detail pages, and connecting with a dealer, which we refer to as a Visitor Action. If an individual accesses a website or application using a different device within a given month, the first Visitor Action taken by each such device is counted as a separate unique user. If an individual uses multiple browsers on a single device and/or clears their cookies and returns to our website or application and takes a Visitor Action within a calendar month, each such Visitor Action is counted as a separate unique user. We eliminate any duplicate unique users that may arise when users visit a webview within our native application. We view our average monthly unique users as a key indicator of the quality of our user experience, the effectiveness of our advertising and traffic acquisition, and the strength of our brand awareness. Measuring unique users is important to us and we believe it provides useful information to our investors because our marketplace revenue depends, in part, on our ability to provide dealers with connections to our users and exposure to our marketplace audience. We define connections as interactions between

44

Table of Contents

consumers and dealers on our marketplace through phone calls, email, managed text and chat, and clicks to access the dealer’s website or map directions to the dealership.

Monthly Sessions

We define monthly sessions as the number of distinct visits to our websites (excluding the CarOffer website) that include a Visitor Action that take place each month within a given time frame, as measured and defined by GA4. We calculate average monthly sessions as the sum of the monthly sessions in a defined period, divided by the number of months in that period. Effective July 1, 2024, a session is defined as beginning with the first Visitor Action from a computer or mobile device and ending at the earliest of when a user closes their browser window or after 30 minutes of inactivity. We eliminate any duplicate monthly sessions that may arise when users visit a webview within our native application. We believe that measuring the volume of sessions in a time period, when considered in conjunction with the number of unique users in that time period, is an important indicator to us of consumer satisfaction and engagement with our marketplace, and we believe it provides useful information to our investors because the more satisfied and engaged consumers we have, the more valuable our service is to dealers.

Number of Paying Dealers

We define a paying dealer as a dealer account with an active, paid marketplace subscription at the end of a defined period. The number of paying dealers we have is important to us and we believe it provides valuable information to investors because it is indicative of the value proposition of our marketplace products, as well as our sales and marketing success and opportunity, including our ability to retain paying dealers and develop new dealer relationships.

Transactions

We define Transactions within the Digital Wholesale segment as the number of vehicles processed from car dealers, consumers, and other marketplaces through the CarOffer website within the defined period. Transactions consists of each unique vehicle (based on vehicle identification number) that reaches “sold and invoiced” status on the CarOffer website within the defined period, including vehicles sold to car dealers, vehicles sold at third-party auctions, vehicles ultimately sold to a different buyer, and vehicles that are returned to their owners without completion of a sale transaction. We exclude vehicles processed within CarOffer’s intra-group trading solution (Group Trade) from the definition of Transactions, and we only count any unique vehicle once even if it reaches sold status multiple times. The Digital Wholesale segment includes Dealer-to-Dealer transactions and Instant Max Cash Offer transactions. We view Transactions as a key business metric and we believe it provides useful information to investors because it provides insight into growth and revenue for the Digital Wholesale segment. Transactions drive a significant portion of Digital Wholesale segment revenue.

Quarterly Average Revenue per Subscribing Dealer (QARSD)

We define QARSD, which is measured at the end of a fiscal quarter, as the marketplace revenue primarily from subscriptions to our Listings packages and RPM, our digital advertising suite, and other digital add-on products during that trailing quarter divided by the average number of paying dealers in that marketplace during the quarter. We calculate the average number of paying dealers for a period by adding the number of paying dealers at the end of such period and the end of the prior period and dividing by two. This information is important to us, and we believe it provides useful information to investors, because we believe that our ability to grow QARSD is an indicator of the value proposition of our products and the ROI that our paying dealers realize from our products. In addition, increases in QARSD, which we believe reflect the value of exposure to our engaged audience in relation to subscription cost, are driven in part by our ability to grow the volume of connections to our users and the quality of those connections, which result in increased opportunity to upsell package levels and cross-sell additional products to our paying dealers.

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Attributable to Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have presented within this Annual Report Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP, and are not necessarily comparable to any similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

We define Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, impairments, stock‑based compensation expense, stock-based compensation expense for CarOffer, LLC Units (as defined below), transaction-related expenses, other income, net, and provision for income taxes.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA adjusted to exclude: Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest.

We define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest as net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest adjusted to exclude: depreciation and amortization, impairments, stock‑based compensation expense, stock-based compensation expense for CarOffer, LLC Units, other expense, net, and provision for income taxes. These exclusions are adjusted for redeemable noncontrolling interest of 38% by taking the noncontrolling interest’s full financial results and multiplying each line item in the reconciliation by 38%. We note that we use 38%, versus 49%, to allocate the share of loss because it represents the portion attributable to the redeemable noncontrolling interest. The 38% is exclusive of CO Incentive Units, Subject Units, and 2021 Incentive Units (as each term is defined in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report), which are liability-classified awards that do not participate in the share of loss. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest is reflective of our acquisition of the remaining minority equity interests in CarOffer completed on December 1, 2023, or the 2023 CarOffer Transaction. Following the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, there was no redeemable noncontrolling interest as of December 1, 2023, and as a result, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is equivalent to Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024.

46

Table of Contents

We use Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because they are key measures used by our management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. We believe Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude. Accordingly, we believe that Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision making. We use Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest because it is used by our management to reconcile Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA. It represents the portion of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA that is attributable to our redeemable noncontrolling interest and enables an investor to gain a clearer understanding of the portion of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA that is attributable to our redeemable noncontrolling interest. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest is not intended to be reviewed on its own.

Our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest rather than consolidated net income and net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, respectively, which are the most directly comparable GAAP equivalents. Some of these limitations are:

•
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest exclude depreciation and amortization expense and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future;

•
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest exclude impairments, which include non-cash one-time expenses associated with the impairment of the CarOffer reporting unit as well as impairments of certain other assets, which may have to be replaced in the future;

•
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest exclude stock-based compensation expense, which will be, for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;

•
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest exclude stock-based compensation expense for CarOffer, LLC Units, which consists of one-time modifications and expense associated with our CO Incentive Units, Subject Units, and Noncontrolling Interest Units (as defined in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report); 

•
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude transaction-related expenses incurred by us during a reporting period, which are inclusive of certain transaction and integration costs associated with the 2023 CarOffer Transaction and which may not be reflective of our operational performance during such period, for acquisitions that have been completed as of the filing date of our annual or quarterly report (as applicable) relating to such period;

•
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest exclude other income, net, which consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and foreign exchange gains and losses;

•
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest exclude the provision for income taxes;

•
Adjusted EBITDA excludes Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, which is calculated as the net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, adjusted for all exclusions used to calculate Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as described above; and

•
other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, we consider, and you should consider, Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest together with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

Components of Consolidated Income Statements

Revenue

We derive our revenue from marketplace revenue, wholesale revenue, and product revenue. Marketplace revenue is included in the U.S. Marketplace segment and Other category of segment reporting. Wholesale revenue and product revenue are primarily included in the Digital Wholesale segment. We generate marketplace revenue from (i) dealer subscriptions to our Listings packages, RPM, our digital advertising suite, Digital Retail, and Top Dealer Offers, (ii) advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto‑related brand advertisers, and (iii) revenue from partnerships with financing services companies. We generate wholesale revenue primarily from (x) transaction fees earned from Dealer-to-Dealer transactions, (y) transaction fees earned from the sale of vehicles to dealers that we acquire at other marketplaces, and (z) transaction fees earned from performing inspection and transportation services, inclusive of Dealer-to-Dealer transactions, other marketplace-to-dealer transactions, and Instant Max Cash Offer transactions. We generate product revenue primarily from (A) aggregate proceeds received from the sale of vehicles that were acquired through Instant Max Cash Offer transactions, and (B) proceeds received from the sale of vehicles that were acquired through arbitration.

Marketplace Revenue

We offer multiple types of marketplace Listings packages to our dealers for our CarGurus U.S. platform (availability varies on our other marketplaces): Restricted Listings, which is free; and various levels of Listings packages, which each require a paid subscription under a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual subscription basis.

Our subscriptions for customers generally auto-renew on a monthly basis and are cancellable by dealers with 30 days’ advance notice prior to the commencement of the applicable renewal term. Subscription pricing is determined based on a dealer’s inventory size, region, and our assessment of the connections and ROI the platform will provide them and is subject to discounts and/or fee reductions that we may offer from time to time. We also offer all dealers on the platform access to our Dealer Dashboard, which includes a performance summary, Dealer Insights tool, and user review management platform. Only dealers subscribing to a paid Listings package have access to the Pricing Tool, Market Analysis tool, and IMV Scan tool.

We also offer paid Listings packages for the Autolist and PistonHeads websites.

In addition to displaying inventory in our marketplace and providing access to the Dealer Dashboard, we offer dealers subscribing to certain of our Listings packages other subscription advertising and customer acquisition products and enhancements marketed under RPM and our digital advertising suite. Through RPM, dealers can buy advertising that appears in our marketplace, on other sites on the internet, and/or on high-converting social media platforms. Such advertisements can be targeted by the user’s geography, search history, CarGurus website activity, and a number of other targeting factors, allowing dealers to increase their visibility with in-market consumers and drive qualified traffic for dealers.

We also offer dealer advertising products for the PistonHeads website.

We also offer dealers subscribing to certain of our Listings packages other subscription advertising and customer acquisition products and enhancements such as Digital Retail, which allows shoppers to complete much of the vehicle-purchase process online through the Dealers’ Listings page. Digital Retail is comprised of (i) the Digital Deal Platform, which gives dealers higher quality leads through upfront consumer-provided information; (ii) Geo Expansion, which expands the visibility of a dealer’s inventory in the search results beyond its local market; and (iii) Hard Pull Financing, which provides loan information.

We also offer dealers subscribing to certain of our Listings packages other subscription advertising and customer acquisition products and enhancements such as Top Dealer Offers, which allows dealers to pay for leads to receive direct access to shoppers actively looking to sell their vehicles. Dealers can acquire inventory from shoppers who are looking to sell directly through the CarGurus Sell My Car page.

Marketplace revenue also consists of non-dealer advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers sold on a cost-per-thousand impressions basis, or CPM basis. An impression is an advertisement loaded on a web page. In addition to advertising sold on a CPM basis, we also have advertising sold on a cost-per-click basis. Pricing is primarily based on advertisement size and position on our websites and mobile applications. Auto manufacturers and other brand advertisers can execute advertising campaigns that are targeted across a wide variety of parameters, including demographic groups, behavioral characteristics,

49

Table of Contents

specific auto brands, categories such as Certified Pre-Owned, and segments such as hybrid vehicles. We do not provide minimum impression guarantees or other types of minimum guarantees in our contracts with customers. Advertising is also sold indirectly through revenue sharing arrangements with advertising exchange partners.

We also offer non-dealer advertising products for the Autolist and PistonHeads websites.

Marketplace revenue also includes revenue from partnerships with certain financing services companies pursuant to which we enable eligible consumers on our CarGurus U.S. website to pre-qualify for financing on cars from dealerships that offer financing through such companies. We primarily generate revenue from these partnerships based on the number of funded loans from consumers who pre-qualify with our lending partners through our site.

Wholesale Revenue

The CarOffer Matrix enables buying dealers to create standing buy orders and provides instant offers to selling dealers. Wholesale revenue includes transaction fees earned from Dealer-to-Dealer transactions, where we collect fees from both the buying and selling dealers. We also sell vehicles to dealers that we acquire at other marketplaces, where we collect a transaction fee from the buying dealers.

Wholesale revenue also includes fees earned from performing inspection and transportation services, where we collect fees from the buying dealer. Inspection and transportation service revenue is inclusive of Dealer-to-Dealer transactions, other marketplace-to-dealer transactions, and Instant Max Cash Offer transactions.

Wholesale revenue also includes arbitration in which the vehicle is rematched to a new buyer and not acquired by us. Arbitration is the process by which we investigate and resolve claims from buying dealers.

Wholesale revenue also includes fees earned from certain guarantees offered to dealers (which include 45-Day Guarantee and OfferGuard products), where we collect fees from the buying dealer or selling dealer, as applicable.

Product Revenue

The CarOffer Matrix enables consumers who are selling vehicles to be instantly presented with an offer. Product revenue includes the aggregate proceeds received from the sale of vehicles through Instant Max Cash Offer transactions, including vehicle sale price and transaction fees collected from the buying dealers. Product revenue also includes proceeds received from the sale of vehicles acquired through arbitration, including vehicle sale price and transaction fees collected from buying dealers. Arbitration is the process by which we investigate and resolve claims from buying dealers. We control the vehicle in these transactions and, therefore, act as the principal.

Cost of Revenue

Marketplace Cost of Revenue

Marketplace cost of revenue includes expenses related to supporting and hosting marketplace service offerings. These expenses include personnel and related expenses for our customer support team, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation; third-party service provider expenses such as advertising, data, and hosting expenses; amortization of developed technology; amortization and impairment of capitalized website development; amortization of capitalized hosting arrangements; and allocated overhead expenses. We allocate overhead expenses, such as rent and facility expenses, software expense, and employee benefit expense, to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category.

Wholesale Cost of Revenue

Wholesale cost of revenue includes expenses related to supporting and hosting Digital Wholesale service offerings, including Dealer-to-Dealer transactions and vehicles sold to dealers acquired at other marketplaces on the CarOffer Matrix. These expenses include vehicle transportation and inspection expenses; net losses on vehicles related to guarantees offered to dealers through Dealer-to-Dealer transactions; personnel and related expenses for employees directly involved in the fulfillment and support of transactions, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation; third-party service provider expenses; amortization of developed technology; amortization and impairment of capitalized website development; and allocated overhead

Product cost of revenue includes expenses related to vehicles sold to dealers through Instant Max Cash Offer transactions and vehicles sold to dealers acquired through arbitration. These expenses include the cost of the vehicle and transportation expenses.

Operating Expenses

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing team, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, commissions, and stock-based compensation; expenses associated with consumer marketing, such as traffic acquisition, brand building, and public relations activities; expenses associated with dealer marketing, such as content marketing, customer and promotional events, and industry events; consulting services; software subscription expenses; travel expenses; amortization of capitalized hosting arrangements; and allocated overhead expenses. A portion of our commissions that are related to obtaining a new contract are capitalized and amortized over the estimated benefit period of customer relationships. Other than commissions amortization, all other sales and marketing expenses are expensed as incurred. We expect sales and marketing expense to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonality and as we respond to changes in the macroeconomic and competitive landscapes affecting our existing dealers, consumer audience, and brand awareness.

Product, Technology, and Development

Product, technology, and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our research and development team, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation; software subscription expenses; consulting services; and allocated overhead expenses. Other than website development, internal-use software, and hosting arrangement expenses, research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. We expect product, technology, and development expense to increase as we invest in additional engineering resources to develop new solutions and make improvements to our existing platform.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, people & talent, and administrative teams, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation; expenses associated with professional fees for audit, tax, external legal, and consulting services; payment processing and billing expenses; insurance expenses; software subscription expenses; and allocated overhead expenses. General and administrative expense is expensed as incurred. We expect general and administrative expense to increase as we continue to scale our business.

Impairment

During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we identified a triggering event that required an interim impairment test at the CarOffer reporting unit due to recent organizational changes and Transaction volume declines, which resulted in revisions to our financial projections for the CarOffer reporting unit. As a result, we performed an updated fair value analysis of the CarOffer reporting unit, and subsequently recognized impairment losses of $4.7 million, $7.6 million, and $115.2 million for right-of-use assets, intangible assets, and goodwill, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized Digital Wholesale segment impairment charges related to the CarOffer reporting unit of $127.5 million as impairment operating expense.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we decided to end our CG Buy Online pilot in order to redirect those resources toward other investment opportunities, including continued product innovation and development across our business. The CG Buy Online pilot was one of the initiatives that allowed consumers to purchase vehicles online. As a result, we recognized impairment losses of $15.8 million, $0.5 million, and $0.5 million for property and equipment, net; prepaid expenses, prepaid income taxes, and other current assets; and other non-current assets, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized Digital Wholesale segment impairment charges related to the CG Buy Online reporting unit of $9.8 million and $7.0 million as wholesale cost of revenue and impairment operating expense, respectively.

Table of Contents

For further discussion of impairments, see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation on property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets and internal-use software.

Other Income, Net

Other income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, as well as foreign exchange gains and losses.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to federal and state research and development tax credits, partially offset by state and local income taxes, non-deductible meals and entertainment and transportation expenses, and Section 162(m) excess officers compensation disallowance.

Overall revenue decreased $19.9 million, or 2%, in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Marketplace revenue increased $98.4 million, or 14%, in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, and represented 89% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 76% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in Listings revenue, inclusive of certain digital add-on products, as a result of growth in QARSD, which was driven by signing on new dealers with higher average subscription revenue and revenue expansion through product adoption or upgrades and price increases for existing dealers. The increase was also due in part to an increase in advertising revenue due primarily to increased spend by advertisers related to new and existing campaigns.

Wholesale revenue decreased $49.7 million, or 49%, in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, and represented 6% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 11% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a 47% decrease in Transactions, which includes Dealer-to-Dealer transactions and Instant Max Cash Offer transactions, to 34,395 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 65,418 for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Product revenue decreased $68.5 million, or 60%, in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, and represented 5% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 13% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in proceeds received from the sale of vehicles through Instant Max Cash Offer transactions, driven by a decrease in Transactions. The decrease in product revenue was also due in part to a decrease in proceeds received from the sale of vehicles acquired through arbitration as a result of decreased arbitration claims due primarily to lower Transaction volume.

The decrease was due primarily to a $4.4 million decrease in fees related to provisioning advertising campaigns on external websites.

Wholesale cost of revenue decreased $35.7 million, or 40%, in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, and represented 6% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 10% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was due primarily to an $18.9 million decrease in amortization related to the CarOffer acquired developed technology intangible asset as it became fully amortized during the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was also due in part to a $22.6 million decrease in transportation expense, inspection expense, and data fees as a result of lower Transaction volume. The decrease was offset in part by a $9.8 million increase in impairment of capitalized website development costs due to the end of the CG Buy Online pilot.

Product cost of revenue decreased $66.6 million, or 59%, in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, and represented 5% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 12% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Additionally, a $2.7 million tax benefit related to excess stock-based compensation deductions was recognized during 2024 compared to $4.7 million tax expense recognized during 2023. Additional tax expense was also recorded in 2023 relating to a $6.9 million deferred state tax expense in association with the Massachusetts apportionment tax rule change and a $2.5 million tax expense was recognized in connection with the 2023 CarOffer Transaction.

U.S. Marketplace segment income from operations increased $55.0 million, or 43%, in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, and represented 25% of U.S. Marketplace segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 20% of U.S. Marketplace segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to an increase in revenue of $86.4 million, a decrease in cost of revenue of $5.9 million, and an increase in operating expenses of $37.3 million.

Digital Wholesale segment loss from operations increased $82.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, and represented (183)% of Digital Wholesale segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to (45)% of Digital Wholesale segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due primarily to a decrease in revenue of $118.2 million, a decrease in cost of revenue of $102.3 million, and an increase in operating expenses of $67.0 million. The increase in loss reflects a $127.5 million CarOffer reporting unit impairment and a $16.8 million impairment due to the end of the CG Buy Online pilot. For further discussion of goodwill and other asset impairments, see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Our operations have been financed primarily from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we generated cash from operating activities of $255.5 million and $124.5 million, respectively.

On September 26, 2022, we entered into a Credit Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent and an L/C Issuer (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and the other lenders, L/C Issuers, and parties thereto from time to time, or the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement consists of a revolving credit facility, or the 2022 Revolver, which allows us to borrow up to $400.0 million, $50.0 million of which may be comprised of a letter of credit sub-facility. The borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement may be increased in accordance with the terms and subject to the adjustments as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Specifically, the borrowing capacity may be increased by an amount up to the greater of $250.0 million or 100% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) if certain criteria are met and subject to certain restrictions. Any such increase requires lender approval. Proceeds of any borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. The 2022 Revolver is scheduled to mature on September 26, 2027. As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings and $9.9 million in letters of credit outstanding under the 2022 Revolver associated with our leases, which reduced the borrowing capacity under the 2022 Revolver to $390.1 million. As of December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings and $9.6 million in letters of credit outstanding under the 2022 Revolver associated with our leases, which reduced the borrowing capacity under the 2022 Revolver to $390.4 million.

We believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including access to the 2022 Revolver, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of the filing of this Annual Report. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue; expenses associated with our sales and marketing activities and the support of our product, technology, and development efforts; payments received in advance from a third-party transaction processor; activity under the 2025 Share Repurchase Program; and our investments in international markets. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic effects and other risks detailed more specifically in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report.

On December 8, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program, or the 2022 Share Repurchase Program, pursuant to which we could, from time to time, purchase shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $250.0 million. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program expired on December 31, 2023. All repurchased shares of our Class A common stock under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program were retired. We funded share repurchases under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased and retired 1,350,473 shares for $18.7 million, exclusive of commissions and excise tax, at an average cost of $13.84 per share under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased and retired 11,076,755 shares for $204.1 million, exclusive of commissions and excise tax, at an average cost of $18.43 per share under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program.

On November 7, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the 2024 Share Repurchase Program pursuant to which we could, from time to time, purchase shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $250.0 million. The 2024 Share Repurchase Program expired on December 31, 2024. All repurchased shares of our Class A common stock under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program were retired. We funded share repurchases under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased and retired 6,357,302 shares for $146.1 million, exclusive of commissions and excise tax, at an average cost of $22.98 per share under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program.

On November 7, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the 2025 Share Repurchase Program pursuant to which we may, from time to time, purchase shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $200.0 million. Share repurchases under the 2025 Share Repurchase Program may be made through a variety of methods, including but not limited to open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, and transactions that may be effected pursuant to one or more plans under Rule 10b5-1 and/or Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The 2025 Share Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any minimum dollar amount or number of shares. The 2025 Share Repurchase Program has an effective date of January 1, 2025, and an expiration date of December 31, 2025, and prior to its expiration may be modified, suspended, or discontinued by our Board of Directors at any time without prior notice. All repurchased shares under the 2025 Share Repurchase Program will be retired. We expect to fund share repurchases under the 2025 Share Repurchase Program through cash on hand and cash generated from operations.

To the extent that our operating income, existing cash, cash equivalents, and our borrowing capacity under the 2022 Revolver are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through a public or private equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges, or

unforeseen circumstances. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or if capital is not available to us, our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.” in Part I, Item 1A within this Annual Report.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities of $255.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, was due primarily to consolidated net income of $21.0 million, adjusted for $144.4 million of goodwill and other asset impairment due to the CarOffer reporting unit impairment and the end of the CG Buy Online pilot, as discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, $62.3 million of stock-based compensation expense for equity classified awards to employees, and $25.4 million of depreciation and amortization expense, offset in part by $33.3 million of deferred taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities was also attributable to a $41.8 million increase in lease obligations primarily related to tenant improvement allowance costs incurred, interest accretion increasing lease liabilities, and amortization reducing the right-of-use asset related to 1001 Boylston Street, partially offset by typical lease payments decreasing the lease liability.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $124.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, was due primarily to consolidated net income of $22.1 million, adjusted for $63.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, $48.5 million of depreciation and amortization, $11.8 million of amortization of deferred contract costs, and $0.5 million of amortization of deferred financing costs, offset in part by $37.9 million of deferred taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities was also attributable to a $15.2 million increase in lease obligations, a $11.0 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $9.1 million increase in deferred revenue, a $2.1 million increase in accounts payable, and a $2.0 million decrease in inventory. The increases in cash flow from operations were partially offset by an $18.4 million increase in deferred contract costs, a $3.4 million decrease in accrued expenses, accrued income taxes, and other liabilities, and a $1.5 million increase in prepaid expenses, prepaid income taxes, and other assets.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities of $73.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, was due primarily to $75.2 million in purchases of property and equipment primarily related to our new headquarters at 1001 Boylston Street and $18.8 million in capitalized website development costs due to continued investment on our product offerings, offset in part by $21.2 million in sales of short-term investments.

Net cash used in investing activities of $61.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, was due primarily to $24.6 million in purchases of property and equipment, $20.6 million of purchases of short-term investments, net of sales, and $16.6 million of capitalized website development costs.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities of $168.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, was due primarily to $146.2 million related to the repurchase of our Class A common stock under the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, $24.9 million related to the payment of withholding taxes on net share settlements of restricted stock units, and $1.6 million for the payment of excise taxes on repurchases of common stock, offset in part by $4.9 million related to the proceeds from issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options.

Net cash used in financing activities of $253.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, was due primarily to $208.5 million of payment for repurchase of our Class A common stock under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program, $25.0 million of payment for repurchase of redeemable noncontrolling interest, $15.6 million of payment of withholding taxes on net share settlements of restricted stock units, and $4.5 million of change in gross advance payments received from third-party transaction processor.

Contractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements

See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for our contractual obligations and commitments.

Seasonality

Across the retail automotive industry, consumer purchasing activity is typically greatest in the first three quarters of each year, due in part to the introduction of new vehicle models from manufacturers and the seasonal nature of consumer spending.

Additionally, the volume of wholesale vehicle sales can fluctuate from quarter to quarter driven by several factors, including the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles, and/or inventory challenges in the automotive industry, which affect the demand side of the wholesale industry. Macroeconomic conditions, such as slower growth or recession, higher interest rates, unemployment, inflation, consumer confidence in the economy, consumer debt levels, labor disruptions, work stoppages, or strikes, geopolitical conflicts, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and other matters that influence consumer spending and preferences, can also impact the volume of wholesale vehicle sales, as was evidenced by the global semiconductor chip shortage and other supply related shortages.

The Digital Wholesale segment operating results have reflected the general seasonality of the wholesale vehicle sales market and macroeconomic conditions of the automotive industry. The U.S. Marketplace segment operating results have reflected the macroeconomic conditions of the automotive industry. However, to date, the U.S. Marketplace segment operating results have not been materially impacted by the general seasonality of the automotive industry. This could possibly change as our business and markets mature.

As a result, revenue and cost of revenue related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. Typical seasonality trends may not be observed in periods where other external factors more significantly impact the wholesale industry.

Off‑Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, or material leases that are less than 12 months in duration, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period.

Although we regularly assess these estimates, actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from management’s estimates if these results differ from historical experience, or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate, even if such assumptions are reasonable when made. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they become known.

Critical estimates relied upon in preparing the consolidated financial statements include the determination of sales allowance and variable consideration in our revenue recognition, the impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets, the capitalization and useful lives of product, technology, and development costs for website development, internal-use software, and hosting arrangements, and the valuation and recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill. Accordingly, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates and believe that of our significant accounting policies, these involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity.

Revenue Recognition – Sales Allowance and Variable Consideration

Total consideration for marketplace revenue is stated within the contracts. There are no contractual cash refund rights, but credits may be issued to a customer at our sole discretion. Dealer customers do not have the right to take possession of our software. At the portfolio level, there is also variable consideration that needs to be included in the transaction price. Variable consideration consists of sales allowances, usage fees, and concessions that change the transaction price of the unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligation. We recognize that there are times when there is a customer satisfaction issue or other circumstances that will lead to a credit. Due to the known possibility of future credits, a monthly sales allowance review is performed to defer revenue at

62

Table of Contents

a portfolio level for such future adjustments in the period of incurrence. We establish sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on our history of adjustments and credits provided to our customers. In assessing the adequacy of the sales allowance, we evaluate our history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements.

Advertising contracts state the transaction price within the agreement with payment generally being based on the number of clicks or impressions delivered on our websites. Total consideration is based on output and deemed variable consideration constrained by an agreed upon delivery schedule and is allocated to the period in which the service was rendered. Additionally, there are generally no contractual cash refund rights. Certain contracts do contain the right for credits in situations in which impressions are not displayed in compliance with contractual specifications. At an individual contract level, we may give a credit for a customer satisfaction issue or other circumstance. Due to the known possibility of future credits, a monthly review is performed to defer revenue at an individual contract level for such future adjustments in the period of incurrence.

Other marketplace revenue includes revenue from contracts for which the performance obligation is a series of distinct services with the same level of effort daily. For these contracts, primarily related to our partnerships with financing services companies, we estimate the value of the variable consideration in determining the transaction price and allocate it to the performance obligation. Revenue is estimated and recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual term. We reassess the estimate of variable consideration at each reporting period.

Within wholesale and product transactions, there are typically no contractual cash refund rights, but credits may be issued to a customer at our sole discretion and refunds may be required by law in the case of a vehicle defect. At the portfolio level, there is also variable consideration that needs to be included in the transaction price. Variable consideration consists of sales allowances and concessions that change the transaction price of the unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligation. We recognize that there are times when there is a customer satisfaction issue or other circumstance that will lead to a credit or arbitration. We establish sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on our history of adjustments and credits provided to our customers. In assessing the adequacy of the sales allowance, we evaluate our history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements.

Long‑Lived Assets – Impairment and Useful Lives

We evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. During this review, we re‑evaluate the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost and estimated lives of long-lived assets. Although the assumptions may vary from asset to asset, they generally include operating results, changes in the use of the asset, cash flows, and other indicators of value. Management then determines whether the remaining useful life continues to be appropriate, or whether there has been an impairment of long-lived assets. To test for impairment, recoverability of these assets is first measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is determined to not be recoverable, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.

Website Development and Internal-Use Software Costs – Capitalization and Useful Lives

We determine the amount of website development and internal-use software costs to be capitalized based on the amount of time spent by our developers on projects in the operating stage of development. There is judgment involved in estimating the time allocated to a particular project in the operating stage. A significant change in the time spent on each project could have a material impact on the amount capitalized and related amortization expense in subsequent periods.

Capitalized website development and capitalized internal-use software costs are amortized on a straight‑line basis over their estimated useful life of three years beginning with the time when the product is ready for its intended use. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets when each asset is ready for its intended use, and at least annually thereafter to ensure three years remains appropriate.

We also test for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Impairment is evaluated as discussed in the “Long-Lived Assets – Impairment and Useful Lives” section above.

Table of Contents

Hosting Arrangements – Capitalization and Useful Lives

Our hosting arrangements consist of cloud-based hosting platforms. We determine the amount of hosting costs to be capitalized based on the amount of time spent by our developers on projects in the operating stage of development. There is judgment involved in estimating the time allocated to a particular project in the operating stage. A significant change in the time spent on each project could have a material impact on the amount capitalized and related amortization expense in subsequent periods.

Capitalized implementation costs for hosting arrangements are amortized on a straight‑line basis over an estimated useful life of the term of the hosting arrangement, taking into consideration several other factors such as, but not limited to, options to extend the hosting arrangement or options to terminate the hosting arrangement, beginning with the time when the software is ready for intended use. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets when each asset is ready for its intended use, and at least annually thereafter to ensure the selected useful life remains appropriate.

We also test for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Impairment is evaluated as discussed in the “Long-Lived Assets – Impairment and Useful Lives” section above.

Valuation and Recoverability of Intangible Assets and Goodwill

Intangible Assets – Valuation and Recoverability

Intangible assets are recognized at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Fair value is determined based on inputs and assumptions such as discount rates, rates of return on assets, and long-term sales growth rates.

We amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Useful lives are established based on analysis of all pertinent factors such as: the expected use of the asset, expected useful lives of related assets, provisions that may limit the useful life, historical experience with similar arrangements, effects of economic factors, demand, competition, obsolescence, and maintenance required to maintain the future cash flows.

We evaluate the useful lives of these assets as of the acquisition date and at least annually thereafter to ensure the selected useful life remains appropriate.

We also test for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Impairment is evaluated as discussed in the “Long-Lived Assets – Impairment and Useful Lives” section above.

Goodwill – Valuation and Recoverability

Goodwill is recognized when consideration paid in a purchase acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review.

Conditions that could trigger a more frequent impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in certain agreements, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, an economic downturn affecting automotive marketplaces, increased competition, a significant reduction in our stock price for a sustained period, or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value.

We evaluate impairment either when required following a triggering event or annually on October 1 by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. For the fiscal year 2024, we determined that we had three reporting units with goodwill: U.S. Marketplace, CarOffer, and U.K. Marketplace. We elect to bypass the optional qualitative test for impairment and proceed to Step 1, which is a quantitative impairment test. For the U.S. Marketplace and U.K. Marketplace reporting units, we estimate fair value using a market approach, based on market multiples derived from public companies that we identify as peers. For our U.S. Marketplace and U.K. Marketplace reporting units, we estimate forecasted revenue for the fiscal year and estimate revenue market multiples using publicly available information for each of our peers. For the CarOffer reporting unit, we estimate fair value using an income approach, based on a discounted cash flow method. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value using a discounted cash flow method include revenue and EBITDA forecasts, the weighted average cost of capital and discount rate, debt-free net working

capital forecasts, and long-term growth rate. We reconcile the aggregate fair values of all reporting units to our market capitalization following a triggering event or annually as of October 1, 2024, for reasonableness.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. We are exposed to market risks as described below.

Interest Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to the 2022 Revolver, which allows us to borrow up to $400.0 million. The applicable interest rate is, at our option, based on a number of different benchmark rates and applicable spreads, as determined by the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report). A fluctuation in interest rates does not have an impact on interest expense unless the 2022 Revolver is drawn upon. Such impact would also be dependent on the amount of the draw.

As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings and $9.9 million in letters of credit outstanding under the 2022 Revolver associated with our leases, which reduced the borrowing capacity under the 2022 Revolver to $390.1 million. As of December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings and $9.6 million in letters of credit outstanding under the 2022 Revolver associated with our leases, which reduced the borrowing capacity under the 2022 Revolver to $390.4 million.

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $304.2 million, which consisted of bank deposits, money market accounts, and mutual funds. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $312.1 million, which consisted of bank deposits, money market accounts, and mutual funds.

Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. For the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, fluctuations resulting from changes in the interest rate environment in interest income have not been material to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Given recent changes in the interest rate environment and in an effort to ensure liquidity, we expect variable returns from our cash equivalents for the foreseeable future.

We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. As circumstances change, we will continue to reassess our approach to managing these risks.

Inflation Risk

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. However, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Additionally, inflationary pressures could negatively impact vehicle purchasing behavior, which could have an adverse impact on our financial results.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had foreign currency exposures in the British pound, the Euro, and the Canadian dollar, but fluctuations resulting from exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar have not been material to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. However, fluctuations in exchange rates in the future may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

We have not used any financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange risk exposure. As circumstances change, we will continue to reassess our approach to managing these risks.

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of CarGurus, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CarGurus, Inc.(the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, redeemable noncontrolling interest and stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Adoption of ASU 2023-07 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280)

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for segment disclosures in 2024 and 2023 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting
.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Description of the Matter

As more fully described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, during 2024, the Company recorded an impairment loss on goodwill and certain intangible assets related to the CarOffer reporting unit. Because of declines in transaction volumes, the Company evaluated the CarOffer long-lived assets and goodwill for recoverability and determined that certain assets were not recoverable and were also impaired. As a result, the Company recognized a $7.5 million impairment loss related to brand intangible assets, and a $115.2 million impairment of goodwill, inclusive of a deferred tax impact of $28.4 million. This represented the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of these assets.

Auditing the Company’s impairment of goodwill and intangible assets was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the Company’s determination of the fair value of these assets. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the fair values to the significant underlying assumptions. Significant assumptions used in the Company’s fair value estimate included discount rates, royalty rates, and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g., revenue growth rates, cost of goods sold, and operating expenses). These significant assumptions are especially challenging to audit as they are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management’s impairment testing process. This included testing controls over the Company’s estimation process supporting the fair value of these assets, as well as controls over management’s judgments and evaluation of underlying assumptions regarding the valuations.

Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the key inputs and significant assumptions discussed above. We involved our valuation professionals to assist with our evaluation of discount rates and royalty rates. Additionally, we evaluated the significant assumptions used by the Company described above, and validated the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. Specifically, when evaluating the assumptions related to the forecasted results and changes in the business that would drive these results, we compared the assumptions to historical results of the business and current industry and economic trends. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair values that would result from changes in the assumptions.

Revenue Recognition

Description of the Matter

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of $894.4 million. As explained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
 upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services.

Auditing management’s recognition of revenue was challenging because of the higher extent of audit effort and because the amounts are material to the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Table of Contents

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s revenue recognition process, including controls designed to mitigate the risk of override of controls. This included testing controls over management’s review of manual journal entries and revenue related account reconciliations.
We substantively tested the Company’s revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024, through a combination of data analytics and tests of details. Our audit procedures included, among others, performing a correlation analysis between the related accounts (i.e., revenue, deferred revenue, accounts receivable, and cash) and testing the existence of cash receipts tied to revenue recognition. Additionally, we reconciled revenue recognized to the Company’s general ledger to test completeness and performed substantive test of details over significant customers deemed to be key items and a representative sample of the remaining transactions.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.

CarGurus, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements

(dollars in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise noted)

1. Organization and Business Description

CarGurus, Inc, (the “Company”) is a multinational, online automotive platform for buying and selling vehicles that is building upon its industry-leading listings marketplace with both digital retail solutions and the CarOffer, LLC (“CarOffer”) online wholesale platform. The CarGurus platform gives consumers the confidence to purchase and/or sell a vehicle either online or in person, and it gives dealerships the power to accurately price, effectively market, instantly acquire, and quickly sell vehicles, all with a nationwide reach. The Company uses proprietary technology, search algorithms, and data analytics to bring trust, transparency, and competitive pricing to the automotive shopping experience.

The Company operates principally in the United States (the “U.S.”). In the U.S., it also operates as independent brands the Autolist online marketplace and the CarOffer online wholesale platform. In addition to the U.S., the Company operates online marketplaces under the CarGurus brand in Canada and the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”). In the U.K., it also operates as an independent brand the PistonHeads online marketplace.
The Company has subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, and the U.K. and it has 
two
 reportable segments, U.S. Marketplace and Digital Wholesale. See Note 14 of these consolidated financial statements for further segment reporting and geographic information.
The Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties common to companies in its and similar industries and stages of development including, but not limited to, rapid technological changes, competition from substitute products and services from larger companies, management of international activities, protection of proprietary rights, patent litigation, and dependence on key individuals.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

T
he Company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements to provide additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure. The Company has evaluated all subsequent events and determined that there are no material recognized or unrecognized subsequent events requiring disclosure.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period.

76

Table of Contents

Although the Company regularly assesses these estimates, actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from management’s estimates if these results differ from historical experience, or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate, even if such assumptions are reasonable when made. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they become known.
Critical estimates relied upon in preparing the consolidated financial statements include the determination of sales allowance and variable consideration in the Company’s revenue recognition, the impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets, the capitalization and useful lives of product, technology, and development costs for website development, internal-use software, and hosting arrangements, and the valuation and recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill. Accordingly, the Company considers these to be its critical accounting estimates and believes that of the Company’s significant accounting policies, these involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company has no significant off-balance sheet risk, such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements.
 Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, and other receivables.

The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents, principally with accredited financial institutions of high credit standing. Although the Company deposits its cash and cash equivalents with multiple financial institutions, its deposits with each such financial institution exceed governmental insured limits.
The Company routinely assesses the creditworthiness of its customers and does not require collateral. The Company generally has not experienced any material losses related to receivables from individual customers or groups of customers.

The Company had no material losses related to marketplace receivables as it was dispersed across a large number of customers. The Company had no material losses related to wholesale and product receivables as the third-party transaction processor does not release the title to the vehicle until successfully collecting funds from the buying dealer. Titling is handled by the Company’s third-party transaction processor and titles are held in escrow until it collects funds from the buying dealer (i.e., title is legally transferred from the selling party to the buying party upon signing of bill of sale, but title is held in escrow by the third-party transaction processor until payment is received). Due to these factors, no additional credit risk beyond amounts provided for collection losses was believed by management to be probable in the Company’s accounts receivable and other receivables.
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 
no
 customer accounted for more than 
10
%
 of net accounts receivable and other receivables. All
 of accounts receivable was dispersed among more than 
1,000
 customers. Therefore, there is no significant credit risk with respect to accounts receivable because c
redit risk is dispersed due to the large number of customers.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, 
no
 customer accounted for more than 10%
 of total revenue.

Significant Accounting Policies
The consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described below and elsewhere in the notes of these consolidated financial statements.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash and cash equivalents primarily consisted of cash on deposit with banks, amounts held in interest‑bearing money market accounts, and mutual funds.

Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates their fair market value.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company did not have any short-term investments in equity securities. As of December 31, 2023, the Company held short-term investments in equity securities.

77

Table of Contents

The Company’s investment policy, which was approved by the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), permits investments in fixed income securities, including U.S. government and agency securities, non‑U.S. government securities, money market instruments, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, corporate bonds, and asset‑backed securities.
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments not classified as cash equivalents with maturities less than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as short‑term investments, while investments with maturities in excess of one year from the balance sheet date are classified as long‑term investments. Management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase, and re‑evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date.
Investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized at fair value based on quoted market prices within investments in the consolidated balance sheets. Investments in held‑to‑maturity debt securities are recognized at amortized cost within investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company adjusts the cost of investments in held-to-maturity debt securities for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, if any. Investments in trading and available-for-sale debt securities are recognized at fair value within investments in the consolidated balance sheets. Purchases of equity securities and debt securities are recognized within investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Dividend income from equity securities is recognized within interest income in the consolidated income statements. Reinvested proceeds from dividend income are recognized within purchases of investments in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

The revaluation of equity securities and debt securities results in an unrealized gain or loss. Unrealized gains or losses on equity securities and trading debt securities are recognized within other (expense) income, net in the consolidated income statements and adjusted for in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recognized within other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Interest on held-to-maturity debt securities is recognized within interest income in the consolidated income statements.
Proceeds from sale of equity securities and debt securities are recognized within investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Realized gains and losses on sale of equity securities and debt securities are recognized within other (expense) income, net in the consolidated income statements, adjusted for in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and recognized within proceeds from sale of equity securities and debt securities in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Debt securities are reviewed for other‑than‑temporary impairment whenever the fair value of an investment is less than the amortized cost and evidence indicates that an investment’s carrying amount is not recoverable within a reasonable period of time. Other‑than‑temporary impairments of debt securities are recognized within other (expense) income, net in the consolidated income statements if the Company has experienced a credit loss or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the amortized cost basis. Evidence considered in this assessment includes reasons for the impairment, compliance with the Company’s investment policy, the severity and duration of the impairment, and changes in value subsequent to the end of the period.

Restricted Cash
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, restricted cash was related to pass-through payments from dealers related to the Company’s Digital Wholesale business. Restricted cash is classified as a current asset on the consolidated balance sheets if it is expected to be used or released within one year. Restricted cash is classified as a non-current asset on the consolidated balance sheets 
if it is expected to be used or released beyond one year.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable is recorded based on the amount due from the customer and a third-party transaction processor. Accounts receivable do not bear interest.

78

Table of Contents

The Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through its trade accounts receivable, which includes receivables in transit, net of payables due, from a third-party transaction processor. The third-party transaction processor collects customer payments on the Company’s behalf and remits them to the Company. Customer payments received by the third-party transaction processor, but not remitted to the Company as of period end, are deemed to be receivables in transit, net of payables due. Additionally, the third-party transaction processor provides payments in advance for certain selling dealers. If the third-party transaction processor does not receive buying dealer payments associated with the transaction paid in advance, the Company would guarantee losses incurred by the third-party transaction processor and the balance would be deducted from future remittances to the Company. To date, losses associated with these guarantees have not been material.

The Company offsets trade accounts receivables in transit, net of payables due, from the third-party transaction processor with payments received in advance from the third-party transaction processor as it has the right of offset. At any point in time, the Company could have amounts due from the third-party transaction processor for funds the third-party transaction processor has collected from buying dealers and has not yet remitted to the Company (i.e., receivables in transit, net of payables due), as well as amounts paid by the third-party transaction processor to the Company in advance of collecting payments from buying dealers (i.e., payments received in advance). Therefore, as the Company has the right to offset, the Company can either have a net receivable balance due from the third-party transaction processor which is recognized within accounts receivable, net in the consolidated balance sheets if the advance payments are less than the receivable position from the third-party transaction processor as of the balance sheet date, or the Company can have a net liability which is recognized within accrued expenses, accrued income taxes, and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets if the advance payments exceed the receivable position from the third-party transaction processor as of the balance sheet date. The change in payments received in advance from the third-party transaction processor is presented as cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

As of December 31, 2024, trade accounts receivable from receivables in transit, net of payables due, from the third-party transaction processor was 
$
472
, offset by payments received in advance of 
$
1,193
, which resulted in a net payable of 
$
721
 recognized within accrued expenses, accrued income taxes, and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, trade accounts receivable from receivables in transit, net of payables due, from the third-party transaction processor was 
$
2,868
, offset by payments received in advance of 
$
2,015
, which resulted in a net receivable of 
$
853
 recognized within accounts receivable, net in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company also offsets gross trade accounts receivable with an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company’s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company’s existing accounts receivable and is based upon historical loss trends, the number of days that billings are past due, an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with specific accounts, current economic trends and conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions. If circumstances relating to specific customers change, or unanticipated changes occur in the general business environment, particularly as it affects auto dealers, the Company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
Provisions for allowances for doubtful accounts are recognized within general and administrative expense in the consolidated income statements. Amounts are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted, the potential for recovery is considered remote, and when it is determined that expected credit losses may occur. The Company does not have any off‑balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.

As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, changes in the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization using the straight‑line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements and right-of-use assets are amortized over the lease term, or the estimated useful life of the related asset, if shorter. 
The estimated useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment were as follows:

Estimated Useful Life
(In Years)

Server and computer equipment

3
 to
 5

Capitalized internal-use software

3

Capitalized website development

3

Furniture and fixtures

3
 to 
5

Right-of-use assets

Lease term, or asset life if shorter

Leasehold improvements

Lease term, or asset life if shorter

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, whereas major betterments are capitalized as additions to property and equipment.

Impairment of Long‑Lived Assets
The
 Company evaluates the recoverability of long‑lived assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. During this review, the Company re-evaluates the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost and estimated lives of long-lived assets. Although the assumptions may vary from asset to asset, they generally include operating results, changes in the use of the asset, cash flows, and other indicators of value. Management then determines whether the remaining useful life continues to be appropriate, or whether there has been an impairment of long-lived assets. To test for impairment, recoverability of these assets is first measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is determined to not be recoverable, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.
Capitalized Website Development and Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs
The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with the development of its websites and internal‑use software after the preliminary project stage is complete and until the website development or software is ready for its intended use. Research and development costs incurred during the preliminary project stage or costs incurred for data conversion activities, training, maintenance, and general and administrative, or overhead costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalization begins when the preliminary project stage is complete, management authorizes and commits to the funding of the project with the required authority, it is probable the project will be completed, the website development or software will be used to perform the functions intended, and certain functional and quality standards have been met. Qualified costs incurred during the operating stage of its website development or software relating to upgrades and enhancements are capitalized to the extent it is probable that they will result in added functionality, while costs that cannot be separated between maintenance of, and minor upgrades and enhancements to, websites and internal‑use software are expensed as incurred. The Company determines the amount of website development and internal-use software costs to be capitalized based on the amount of time spent by its developers on projects in the operating stage of development. There is judgment involved in estimating the time allocated to a particular project in the operating stage. A significant change in the time spent on each project could have a material impact on the amount capitalized and related amortization expense in subsequent periods. Capitalized website development and capitalized internal-use software costs are recognized within property and equipment, net in the consolidated balance sheets.

Capitalized website development and capitalized internal-use software costs are amortized on a straight‑line basis over their estimated useful life of 
three years
 beginning with the time when the product is ready for its intended use. Amortization expenses related to capitalized website development costs are recognized within cost of revenue in the consolidated income statements. Amortization expenses related to capitalized internal-use software costs are 
recognized within the operating expense caption for depreciation and amortization in the consolidated income statements. The Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets when each asset is ready for its intended use, and at least annually thereafter to ensure three years remains appropriate. The Company also tests for impairment

at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Impairment is evaluated as discussed in the “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” section above.

During the year ended December 31, 2024

, 
$
3,384
, and 
$
1,286
, respectively.

Capitalized Hosting Arrangements
The Company’s hosting arrangements consist of cloud-based hosting platforms. The Company determines the amount of hosting arrangement implementation costs to be capitalized based on the amount of time spent by its developers on projects in the operating stage of development. There is judgment involved in estimating the time allocated to a particular project in the operating stage. A significant change in the time spent on each project could have a material impact on the amount capitalized and related amortization expense in subsequent periods.
Capitalized implementation costs for hosting arrangements costs are recognized within prepaid expenses, prepaid income taxes, and other current assets and within other non-current assets, as applicable, in the consolidated balance sheets.
Capitalized implementation costs for hosting arrangements are amortized on a straight‑line basis over an estimated useful life of the term of the hosting arrangement, taking into consideration several other factors such as, but not limited to, options to extend the hosting arrangement or options to terminate the hosting arrangement, beginning with the time when the software is ready for intended use. Amortization expenses related to hosting arrangement costs are recognized within the same line item in the consolidated income statements as the expense for fees for the associated hosting arrangement. The Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets when each asset is ready for its intended use, and at least annually thereafter to ensure the selected useful life remains appropriate. The Company also tests for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Impairment is evaluated as discussed in the “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” section above.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company launched separate initiatives designed to enhance its hosting arrangements related to its enterprise applications. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, capitalized implementation costs were 
$
627
 and 
$
1,739
, respectively, and recognized within other non-current assets and within prepaid expenses, prepaid income taxes, and other current assets, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 6 of these consolidated financial statements for details on impairments.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, amortization expense associated with hosting arrangements was 
$
2,341
, 
$
1,962
, and 
$
2,117
, respectively, and recognized within operating expense and cost of revenue in the consolidated income statements.
Business Combinations
Valuation of Acquired Assets and Liabilities
The Company measures all consideration transferred in a business combination at its acquisition-date fair value. Consideration transferred is determined by the acquisition-date fair value of assets transferred and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration obligations, as applicable. The Company measures goodwill as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of assets acquired less liabilities assumed.

81

Table of Contents

The Company makes significant assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date, especially the valuation of intangible assets and certain tax positions. The Company records estimates as of the acquisition date and reassess the estimates at each reporting period up to 
one year
 after the acquisition date. Changes in estimates made prior to finalization of purchase accounting are 
recognized within 
goodwill.

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are recognized at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Fair value is determined based on inputs and assumptions such as discount rates, rates of return on assets, and long-term sales growth rates.

The Company amortizes intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Useful lives are established based on analysis of all pertinent factors such as: the expected use of the asset, expected useful lives of related assets, provisions that may limit the useful life, historical experience with similar arrangements, effects of economic factors, demand, competition, obsolescence, and maintenance required to maintain the future cash flows. 
Amortization is recognized over the relevant estimated useful lives ranging from 
three
 to 
eleven years
. Amortization expenses related to intangible assets are 
recognized within the operating expense caption for depreciation and amortization and cost of revenue in the consolidated income statements.
The Company evaluates the useful lives of these assets as of the acquisition date and at least annually thereafter to ensure the selected useful life remains appropriate. If the estimate of an intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed, the Company amortizes the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.

The Company monitors its long-lived assets for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis in accordance with GAAP, and tests for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Impairment is evaluated as discussed in the 
“Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” section above.
Goodwill
Goodwill is recognized when consideration paid in a purchase acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review. Conditions that could trigger a more frequent impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in certain agreements, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, an economic downturn affecting automotive marketplaces, increased competition, a significant reduction in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period, or a reduction of its market capitalization relative to net book value.

The Company evaluates impairment either when required following a triggering event or annually on October 1 by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. For the fiscal year 2024 the Company determined that it had three reporting units with goodwill: U.S. Marketplace, CarOffer, and U.K. Marketplace. The Company elects to bypass the optional qualitative test for impairment and proceed to Step 1, which is a quantitative impairment test. For the U.S. Marketplace and U.K. Marketplace reporting units, the Company estimates fair value using a market approach, based on market multiples derived from public companies that it identifies as peers. For the U.S. Marketplace and U.K. Marketplace reporting units,
 the Company estimates forecasted revenue for the fiscal year and estimates revenue market multiples using publicly available information for each of its peers. For the CarOffer reporting unit, the Company estimates fair value using an income approach, based on a discounted cash flow method. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value using a discounted cash flow method include revenue and EBITDA forecasts, the weighted average cost of capital and discount rate, debt-free net working capital forecasts, and long-term growth rate. The Company reconciles the aggregate fair values of all reporting units to the Company’s market capitalization following a triggering event or annually as of October 1, 2024, for reasonableness.
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest
In connection with the Company’s acquisition of a 
51
% interest in CarOffer on January 14, 2021, the Company became a party with the noncontrolling equity holders of CarOffer to the 2021 CarOffer Operating Agreement (as defined in “Stock-Based Compensation
” below), which, among other matters, sets forth certain put and call rights described in “Stock-Based Compensation” below. The 2021 CarOffer Operating Agreement provided the Company with the right to purchase, and the noncontrolling equity holders with the right to sell to the Company, the noncontrolling CarOffer equity holders’ equity interests in CarOffer at a contractually defined formulaic purchase price, which was based on a multiple of earnings.

82

Table of Contents

Subsequent to the Company’s acquisition of the 
51
% interest on January 14, 2021, the redeemable noncontrolling interest was measured at the greater of the amount that would be paid if settlement occurred as of the balance sheet date based on the contractually defined redemption value and its carrying amount adjusted for net (loss) income attributable to the noncontrolling interest 
and tax distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interest holders. Adjustments to the carrying value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest resulting from changes in the redemption value were recognized within retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets.
On November 6, 2023, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “2023 Purchase Agreement”) with CarOffer, CarOffer Investors Holding, LLC, CarOffer Midco, LLC (“CarOffer MidCo”), each of the persons set forth on Schedule 1.1(a) to the 2023 Purchase Agreement (the “Indirect Members”), Bruce T. Thompson, an individual residing in Texas, as the sellers’ representative, and the responsible party signatory thereto.

Pursuant to the 2023 Purchase Agreement the Company acquired the remaining minority equity interests in CarOffer (the “2023 CarOffer Transaction”) for an aggregate consideration of $
75.0
 million in cash (the “2023 Consideration”), subject to certain adjustments set forth in the 2023 Purchase Agreement. A portion of the 2023 Consideration was held in escrow to secure certain payment and indemnification obligations of the Indirect Members in accordance with the terms of the 2023 Purchase Agreement. The 2023 CarOffer Transaction was completed on December 1, 2023.
Following the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, CarOffer is a wholly-owned subsidiary and the Company entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, dated December 1, 2023 (the “2023 CarOffer Operating Agreement”
), pursuant to which, among other matters, the existing put and call rights were terminated. As a result of the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, there was no redeemable noncontrolling interest as of December 31, 2023.

Leases
The Company recognizes an operating lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and an operating lease right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying assets for the lease term. The Company reviews all material contracts for embedded leases to determine if they have a right-of-use asset. The Company made an accounting policy election to apply the practical expedient under ASC Topic 842, 
Leases
, to not separate lease components from non-lease components for all leases.
The Company recognizes lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise.

Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the lease payments and are measured using the prevailing index or rate at the measurement date. Variable lease payments not based on an index or a rate are excluded from lease payments and are expensed as incurred.
The Company allocates lease costs, which includes operating lease costs, finance lease costs, and variable lease payments, across all departments based on headcount in the respective location.
The Company made an accounting policy election to not recognize a lease liability or right-of-use asset on its consolidated balance sheets for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, and instead to recognize lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term as expense and variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate as expense in the period in which the achievement of the specified target that triggers the variable lease payments becomes probable.

The Company recognizes sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease period. The Company recognizes sublease income as an offset to rent expense within operating expenses in the consolidated income statements as subleasing is not a primary business activity of the Company and is meant to offset occupancy costs.

83

Table of Contents

Contingent Liabilities

The Company has certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business activities. The Company accrues for loss contingencies when losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company recognizes contingent liabilities within accrued expenses, accrued income taxes, and other current liabilities, and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, as applicable, depending on if the contingency is expected to be resolved within one year or more. 
If the reasonable estimate of the loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the minimum amount of the range is recognized as a liability. The Company does not accrue for contingent losses that, in its judgment, are considered to be reasonably possible, but not probable; however, it discloses the range of such reasonably possible losses, if material.
Income Taxes
The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which it operates.
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

The asset and liability method requires a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In performing this analysis, the Company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to assess realizability. Valuation allowances are reassessed periodically to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized in the future and if any existing valuation allowance should be released.

The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by prescribing a more‑likely‑than‑not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company assesses its income tax positions and recognizes an income tax benefit or expense within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated income statements based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. 
The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit or expense that is greater than 
50
% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority during examination. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if applicable, related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense within other (expense) income
, net in the consolidated income statements. The Company recognizes liabilities related to uncertain tax positions within accrued expenses, accrued income taxes, and other current liabilities, and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, as applicable, depending on if the uncertainty is expected to be resolved within one year or more.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 
15
%. Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions where the Company operates. The Pillar Two legislation is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024. The Company has performed an assessment of its potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes based on the Company’s most recent tax filings, country-by-country reporting, and financial statements for the constituent entities within the Company. Based on the assessment performed, the Company qualifies for the transitional safe harbor in all jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 subjects a U.S. stockholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. An entity can make an accounting policy election, per the FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, 
Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income
, either to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense only. The Company has elected to account for GILTI as a period cost in the year the tax is incurred.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was passed into law on August 16, 2022. The provisions of the IRA were effective beginning with fiscal year 2023, with certain exceptions. The IRA had several new provisions including a 
15
% corporate alternative minimum tax for certain large corporations that have at least an average of $
1.0
 billion of adjusted financial statement income over a consecutive 
three
-tax-year period. The IRA also introduced a 
1
% excise tax imposed on certain stock repurchases by publicly traded U.S. corporations made after December 31, 2022. The Company has appropriately considered the impacts of the 
1
% excise tax on its income tax provision and cash taxes in 2024. Based on the Company’s evaluation, the Company concludes that the IRA has not had a material impact on its income tax provision and cash taxes.
The Company will continue to monitor the changes in tax laws and regulations to evaluate their potential impact on its business.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company measures eligible assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in value recognized in earnings. Fair value treatment may be elected either upon initial recognition of an eligible asset or liability or, for an existing asset or liability, if an event triggers a new basis of accounting. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not elect to remeasure any of its existing financial assets and did not elect the fair value option for any financial assets transacted.
ASC Topic 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 (“ASC 820”), establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for instruments measured at fair value that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and the Company’s own assumptions (unobservable inputs). Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
ASC 820 identifies fair value as the exchange price or exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company uses valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized as follows:
Level 1 — Quoted unadjusted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2 — Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all observable inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
Level 3 — Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable, including assumptions developed by the Company.
The Company has evaluated the estimated fair value of financial instruments using available market information. The use of different market assumptions, estimation methodologies, or both could have a significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

As of December 31, 2024, the carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. As of December 31, 2023
, the carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

Debt
The 
Company may obtain access to capital via credit facilities. The amount of borrowings outstanding on credit facilities are recognized within other current liabilities or other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, depending on the borrowing base. Costs for unutilized revolving commitments and interest for outstanding borrowings are recognized as interest expense within other (expense) income, net in the consolidated income statements. Interest payments are recognized within operating activities in the

85

Table of Contents

consolidated 
statements of cash flows, and repayments of principle amounts are recognized within financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Deferred Financing Costs
The Company capitalizes certain legal and other third-party fees that are directly associated with obtaining access to capital via credit facilities. Deferred financing costs incurred in connection with obtaining access to capital are recognized within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and within financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable credit facility and recognized as interest expense within other (expense) income, net in the consolidated income statements and as an adjustment to consolidated net income in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Foreign Currency Translation
The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the local currency of each subsidiary. All assets and liabilities in the balance sheets of entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates as follows: (i) asset and liability accounts at period‑end rates; (ii) income statement accounts at weighted‑average exchange rates for the period; and (iii) stockholders’ equity accounts at historical exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are excluded from consolidated net income and are recognized within accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the consolidated balance sheets.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in consolidated net income for the period. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries have intercompany transactions that are eliminated upon consolidation, and these transactions expose the Company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations on short‑term intercompany transactions are recognized in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated income statements. Exchange rate fluctuations on long-term intercompany transactions are recognized within accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets.
Revenue Recognition

Sources of Revenue
The Company derives its revenue from marketplace revenue, wholesale revenue, and product revenue. Marketplace revenue is included in the U.S. Marketplace segment and Other category of segment reporting. Wholesale revenue and product revenue are included in the Digital Wholesale segment. The Company generates marketplace revenue from (i) dealer subscriptions to the Company’s Listings packages and Real-time Performance Marketing (“RPM”), digital advertising suite, Digital Retail, and Sell My Car – Top Dealer Offers, (ii) advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto‑related brand advertisers, and (iii) revenue from partnerships with financing services companies. The Company generates wholesale revenue primarily from (x) transaction fees earned from the purchase and sale of vehicles between dealers (“Dealer-to-Dealer transactions”), (y) transaction fees earned from the sale of vehicles to dealers that it acquires at other marketplaces, and (z) transaction fees earned from performing inspection and transportation services, inclusive of Dealer-to-Dealer transactions, other marketplace-to-dealer transactions, and Instant Max Cash Offer transactions (as defined below). The Company generates product revenue primarily from (A) aggregate proceeds received from the sale of vehicles to dealers that were acquired directly from customers or Sell My Car – Instant Max Cash Offer (“Instant Max Cash Offer transactions”), and (B) proceeds received from the sale of vehicles that were acquired through arbitration.
Revenue Recognition
ASC 606 outlines a comprehensive five-step revenue recognition model based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following five steps:
1)
Identify the contract with a customer 
2)
Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3)
Determine the transaction price

4)
Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract
5)
Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation 
Marketplace Revenue – Description
The Company offers multiple types of marketplace Listings packages to its dealers for its CarGurus U.S. platform (availability varies on the Company’s other marketplaces): Restricted Listings, which is free; and various levels of Listings packages, which each require a paid subscription under a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual subscription basis.

The Company’s subscriptions for customers generally auto-renew on a monthly basis and are cancellable by dealers with 30 days’ advance notice prior to the commencement of the applicable renewal term. Subscription pricing is determined based on a dealer’s inventory size, region, and the Company’s assessment of the connections and return on investment (“ROI”) the platform will provide them and is subject to discounts and/or fee reductions that the Company may offer from time to time. The Company also offers all dealers on the platform access to its Dealer Dashboard, which includes a performance summary, Dealer Insights tool, and user review management platform. Only dealers subscribing to a paid Listings package have access to the Pricing Tool, Market Analysis tool, and Instant Market Value Scan tool.

The Company also offers paid Listings packages for the Autolist and PistonHeads websites.

In addition to displaying inventory in the Company’s marketplace and providing access to the Dealer Dashboard, the Company offers dealers subscribing to certain of its Listings packages other subscription advertising and customer acquisition products and enhancements marketed under the Company’s RPM and digital advertising suite. Through RPM, dealers can buy advertising that appears in the Company’s marketplace, on other sites on the internet, and/or on high-converting social media platforms. Such advertisements can be targeted by the user’s geography, search history, CarGurus website activity, and a number of other targeting factors, allowing dealers to increase their visibility with in-market consumers and drive qualified traffic for dealers.
The Company also offers dealer advertising products for the PistonHeads website.
The Company also offers dealers subscribing to certain of its Listings packages other subscription advertising and customer acquisition products and enhancements such as Digital Retail, which allows shoppers to complete much of the vehicle-purchase process online through the Dealers’ Listings page. Digital Retail is comprised of (i) the Digital Deal Platform, which gives dealers higher quality leads through upfront consumer-provided information; (ii) Geo Expansion, which expands the visibility of a dealer’s inventory in the search results beyond its local market; and (iii) Hard Pull Financing, which provides loan information.

The Company also offers dealers subscribing to certain of its Listings packages other subscription advertising and customer acquisition products and enhancements such as Top Dealer Offers, which allows dealers to pay for leads to receive direct access to shoppers actively looking to sell their vehicles. Dealers can acquire inventory from shoppers who are looking to sell directly through the CarGurus Sell My Car page.

Marketplace revenue also consists of non-dealer advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers sold on a cost per thousand impressions basis (“CPM basis”). An impression is an advertisement loaded on a web page. In addition to advertising sold on a CPM basis, the Company also has advertising sold on a cost-per-click basis. Pricing is primarily based on advertisement size and position on the Company’s websites and mobile applications. Auto manufacturers and other brand advertisers can execute advertising campaigns that are targeted across a wide variety of parameters, including demographic groups, behavioral characteristics, specific auto brands, categories such as Certified Pre-Owned, and segments such as hybrid vehicles. The Company does not provide minimum impression guarantees or other types of minimum guarantees in its contracts with customers. Advertising is also sold indirectly through revenue sharing arrangements with advertising exchange partners.

The Company also offers non-dealer advertising products for the Autolist and PistonHeads websites.
Marketplace revenue also includes revenue from partnerships with certain financing services companies pursuant to which the Company enables eligible consumers on the CarGurus U.S. website to pre-qualify for financing on cars from dealerships that offer financing through such companies. The Company primarily generates revenue from these partnerships based on the number of funded loans from consumers who pre-qualify with its lending partners through its site.

Marketplace Revenue – Revenue Recognition
For Listings, Digital Retail, RPM, and Top Dealer Offers, the Company provides a single similar service each day for a period of time. Each time increment (i.e., one day), rather than the underlying activities, is distinct and substantially the same and, therefore, the performance obligation of the Company is to provide a series of daily activities over the contract term. Similar to the dealer listings, the dealer advertising is considered a promise to provide a single similar service each day. Each time increment is distinct and substantially the same and, therefore, the performance obligation of the Company is to provide a series of daily activities over the contract term.

Total consideration for marketplace revenue is stated within the contracts. There are no contractual cash refund rights, but credits may be issued to a customer at the sole discretion of the Company. Dealer customers do not have the right to take possession of the Company’s software. At the portfolio level, there is also variable consideration that needs to be included in the transaction price. Variable consideration consists of sales allowances, usage fees, and concessions that change the transaction price of the unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligation. The Company recognizes that there are times when there is a customer satisfaction issue or other circumstances that will lead to a credit. Due to the known possibility of future credits, a monthly sales allowance review is performed to defer revenue at a portfolio level for such future adjustments in the period of incurrence. The Company establishes sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on its history of adjustments and credits provided to its customers. In assessing the adequacy of the sales allowance, the Company evaluates its history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. Sales allowances are recognized as a reduction to revenue in the consolidated income statements.
Performance obligations are satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the service. Revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the Company starts providing services to the customer under the contract. Revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers. Customers are billed in advance on the first day of each calendar month with payment terms generally due upon receipt or 
30 days
 from the date invoiced. Billings are recognized as accounts receivable or short-term deferred revenue when payment is received in advance of services being delivered to the customers.
For non-dealer advertising revenue from auto manufacturers and other auto-related brand advertisers, the performance obligation is to publish the agreed upon campaign on the Company’s websites and load the related impressions.

Advertising contracts state the transaction price within the agreement with payment generally being based on the number of clicks or impressions delivered on the Company’s websites. Total consideration is based on output and deemed variable consideration constrained by an agreed upon delivery schedule and is allocated to the period in which the service was rendered. Additionally, there are generally no contractual cash refund rights. Certain contracts do contain the right for credits in situations in which impressions are not displayed in compliance with contractual specifications. At an individual contract level, the Company may give a credit for a customer satisfaction issue or other circumstance. Due to the known possibility of future credits, a monthly review is performed to defer revenue at an individual contract level for such future adjustments in the period of incurrence.
Performance obligations for Company-sold advertising revenue and partner-sold advertising revenue are satisfied over time as impressions are delivered. Revenue is recognized based on the total number of impressions delivered within the specified period. Revenue from advertising sold directly by the Company is recognized based on the gross amount charged to the advertiser because the Company is the principal in the arrangement as it controls the ad placement and timing of the campaign, establishes the selling price, and is directly responsible for the fulfillment of the contractual terms including any remedy for issues with such fulfillment. Revenue from advertising sold by partners is recognized based on the net amount of revenue received from the content partners because the Company is the agent in the arrangement as the advertising partner is responsible for fulfillment, including the acceptability of the services delivered. In partner-sold advertising arrangements, the advertising partner has a direct contractual relationship with the advertiser. There is no contractual relationship between the Company and the advertiser for partner-sold transactions. Additionally, for auction-based partner agreements, the Company has latitude in establishing the floor price, but the final price established by the exchange server is at market rates. Revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers. Customers are billed monthly in arrears with payment terms generally 30, 60, or 90 days from the date invoiced. Unbilled accounts receivable generally relate to services rendered in the current period, but not invoiced until the subsequent period.

Other marketplace revenue includes revenue from contracts for which the performance obligation is a series of distinct services with the same level of effort daily. For these contracts, primarily related to the Company’s partnerships with financing services companies, the Company estimates the value of the variable consideration in determining the transaction price and allocates it to the performance obligation. Revenue is estimated and recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual term. The Company reassesses the estimate of variable consideration at each reporting period.

Wholesale Revenue – Description
The CarOffer Matrix enables buying dealers to create standing buy orders and provides instant offers to selling dealers. Wholesale revenue includes transaction fees earned from Dealer-to-Dealer transactions, where the Company collects fees from both the buying and selling dealers. The Company also sells vehicles to dealers that it acquires at other marketplaces, where it collects a transaction fee from the buying dealers.

Wholesale revenue also includes fees earned from performing inspection and transportation services, where it collects fees from the buying dealer. Inspection and transportation service revenue is inclusive of Dealer-to-Dealer transactions, other marketplace to dealer transactions, and Instant Max Cash Offer transactions.
Wholesale revenue also includes arbitration in which the vehicle is rematched to a new buyer and not acquired by the Company. Arbitration is the process by which the Company investigates and resolves claims from buying dealers.

Wholesale revenue also includes fees earned from certain guarantees offered to dealers (which include 
45
-Day Guarantee and OfferGuard products), where the Company collects fees from the buying dealer or selling dealer, as applicable. Guarantee revenue is not accounted for under ASC 606 and is accounted for under ASC Topic 460, 
Guarantees 
(“ASC 460”), as discussed further in Note 2 of these consolidated financial statements.
Wholesale Revenue – Revenue Recognition

When facilitating Dealer-to-Dealer transactions and for vehicles sold to dealers that are acquired at other marketplaces, the Company does not control the vehicle and, therefore, acts as an agent in the transaction. Revenue earned from the fees for facilitating these transactions is recognized at a point in time when the vehicle is sold on a net basis.
For inspection and transportation services, the Company leverages a network of third-party inspection service providers and transportation carriers. The Company controls both inspection and transportation services as it is primarily responsible for fulfillment and, therefore, acts as a principal in the transaction. Revenue from fees for inspection services is recognized at the point in time when the inspection is performed and revenue from fees for transportation services is recognized over time as delivery is completed. Revenue from both inspection and transportation services is recognized on a gross basis. Unearned revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations is recognized as deferred revenue.
Wholesale revenue also includes arbitration in which the vehicle is rematched to a new buyer and not acquired by the Company. Arbitration is the process by which the Company investigates and resolves claims from buying dealers. In these rematch situations, the Company does not control the vehicle and, therefore, acts as an agent in the transaction. Revenue from a rematch transaction is recognized in line with fee revenue relating to the facilitation of the transaction, inspection services, and transportation services.
Within wholesale transactions, there are typically no contractual cash refund rights, but credits may be issued to a customer at the sole discretion of the Company and refunds may be required by law in the case of a vehicle defect. At the portfolio level, there is also variable consideration that needs to be included in the transaction price. Variable consideration consists of sales allowances and concessions that change the transaction price of the unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligation. The Company recognizes that there are times when there is a customer satisfaction issue or other circumstance that will lead to a credit or arbitration. The Company establishes sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on its history of adjustments and credits provided to its customers. In assessing the adequacy of the sales allowance, the Company evaluates its history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. Upon recognizing a sales transaction, the Company estimates the amount of transaction price that will be reversed in a subsequent period and records a reserve for returns and cancellations in other current liabilities and accounts receivable, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Sales allowances are recognized as a reduction to revenue in the consolidated income statements and an increase to other current liabilities or a reduction to accounts receivable, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Wholesale revenue is also offset by concessions. Concessions are

89

recognized as a reduction to revenue in the consolidated income statements and an increase in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets.
Wholesale revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers.

Customers are billed upon successful matching of a buyer and seller, with payment due upon receipt.
Product Revenue – Description
The CarOffer Matrix enables consumers who are selling vehicles to be instantly presented with an offer. Product revenue includes the aggregate proceeds received from the sale of vehicles through Instant Max Cash Offer transactions, including vehicle sale price and transaction fees collected from the buying dealers. Product revenue also includes proceeds received from the sale of vehicles acquired through arbitration, including vehicle sale price and transaction fees collected from buying dealers. Arbitration is the process by which the Company investigates and resolves claims from buying dealers. The Company controls the vehicle in these transactions and, therefore, acts as the principal.

Product – Revenue Recognition
For vehicles sold to dealers that are acquired through Instant Max Cash Offer transactions, the Company controls the vehicle and, therefore, acts as a principal in the transaction. Revenue earned from proceeds received on the sale of vehicles through Instant Max Cash Offer transactions, including vehicle sale price and transaction fees collected from the buying dealers, is recognized at a point in time when the vehicle is sold on a gross basis.
In certain situations across all transactions, during an arbitration process the Company acquires vehicles in transactions in which it controls the vehicle and, therefore, acts as a principal in the transaction. Revenue earned from the sale of vehicles acquired through arbitration, including vehicle sale price and transaction fees collected from buying dealers, is recognized at a point in time on a gross basis.
Within product transactions, there are typically no contractual cash refund rights, but credits may be issued to a customer at the sole discretion of the Company and refunds may be required by law in the case of a vehicle defect. At the portfolio level, there is also variable consideration that needs to be included in the transaction price. Variable consideration consists of sales allowances and concessions that change the transaction price of the unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligation. The Company recognizes that there are times when there is a customer satisfaction issue or other circumstance that will lead to a credit or arbitration. The Company establishes sales allowances at the time of revenue recognition based on its history of adjustments and credits provided to its customers. In assessing the adequacy of the sales allowance, the Company evaluates its history of adjustments and credits made through the date of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. Upon recognizing a sales transaction, the Company estimates the amount of transaction price that will be reversed in a subsequent period and records a reserve for returns and cancellations in other current liabilities and accounts receivable, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Sales allowances are recognized as a reduction to revenue, as well as a reduction to cost of revenue as applicable for returned vehicles, in the consolidated income statements and an increase to other current liabilities or a reduction to accounts receivable, as well as an increase to other current assets as applicable for returned vehicles, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Product revenue is also offset by concessions. Concessions are recognized as a reduction to revenue in the consolidated income statements and an increase in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
Product revenue is presented net of any taxes collected from customers.
Customers are billed upon successful matching of a buyer and seller, with payment due upon receipt.
Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations
The Company periodically enters into arrangements that include Listings and/or dealer advertising product subscriptions within marketplace revenue. These contracts include multiple promises that the Company evaluates to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations. Performance obligations are identified based on services to be transferred to a customer that are distinct within the context of the contractual terms. Once the performance obligations have been identified, the Company determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. If

90

Table of Contents

required, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative standalone selling price method as the performance obligation is being satisfied. For the Company’s arrangements that include Listings and/or dealer advertising product subscriptions, the performance obligations were satisfied over a consistent period of time and, therefore, the allocations did not impact the revenue recognized.
For wholesale and product arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates revenue based on fair value. Vehicle and inspection revenues are recognized at a point in time and transportation revenue is recognized over time.
Costs to Obtain a Contract
Commissions paid to sales representatives and payroll taxes are considered costs to obtain a contract. Under ASC 606, the costs to obtain a contract require capitalization and amortization of those costs over the period of benefit. Although the guidance specifies the accounting for an individual contract with a customer, as a practical expedient, the Company has opted to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics. The Company has opted to apply another practical expedient to immediately expense the incremental cost of obtaining a contract when the underlying related asset would have been amortized over one year or less. As such, the Company applied this practical expedient to advertising contracts and wholesale and product transactions as the term is one year or less and these contracts do not renew automatically. The practical expedient is not applicable to marketplace subscription contracts as the period of benefit including renewals is anticipated to be greater than one year. The assets are periodically assessed for impairment.
For marketplace subscription customers, the commissions paid on contracts with new customers, in addition to any commission amount related to incremental sales, are capitalized and amortized over the estimated benefit period of the customer relationship taking into account factors such as peer estimates of technology lives and customer lives as well as the Company’s own historical data. Commissions paid that are not directly related to obtaining a new contract are expensed as incurred.
Additionally, the Company allocates employer payroll tax expense to the commission expense in proportion to the overall payroll taxes paid during the respective period. As such, capitalized payroll taxes are amortized in the same manner as the underlying capitalized commissions.
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue primarily consists of payments received in advance of revenue recognition from the Company’s marketplace revenue and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company generally invoices its customers monthly. Accordingly, the deferred revenue balances do not represent the total contract value of annual or multiyear subscription agreements. Deferred revenue that is expected to be recognized during the succeeding 12‑month period is recognized as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recognized as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets. All deferred revenue was recognized as current for all periods presented.
Marketplace Cost of Revenue
Marketplace cost of revenue includes expenses related to supporting and hosting marketplace service offerings. These expenses include personnel and related expenses for the Company’s customer support team, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation; third-party service provider expenses such as advertising, data, and hosting expenses; amortization of developed technology; amortization of capitalized website development; amortization and impairment of capitalized hosting arrangements; and allocated overhead expenses. The Company allocates overhead expenses, such as rent and facility expenses, software expense, and employee benefit expense, to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category.

Wholesale Cost of Revenue
Wholesale cost of revenue includes expenses related to supporting and hosting Digital Wholesale service offerings, including Dealer-to-Dealer transactions and vehicles sold to dealers acquired at other marketplaces on the CarOffer Matrix. These expenses include vehicle transportation and inspection expenses; net losses on vehicles related to guarantees offered to dealers through Dealer-to-Dealer transactions; personnel and related expenses for employees directly involved in the fulfillment and support of transactions, including salaries, benefits, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation; third-party service provider expenses;

91

Table of Contents

amortization of developed technology; amortization and impairment of capitalized website development; and allocated overhead expenses. The Company allocates overhead expenses, such as rent and facility expenses, software expense, and employee benefit expense, to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category.
Product Cost of Revenue
Product cost of revenue includes expenses related to vehicles sold to dealers through Instant Max Cash Offer transactions and vehicles sold to dealers acquired through arbitration. These expenses include the cost of the vehicle and transportation expenses.
Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into agreements with its customers, partners, and service providers that include commercial provisions with respect to licensing, infringement, guarantees, indemnification, and other common provisions.

The Company provides certain guarantees to dealers through products such as its 
45
-Day Guarantee and OfferGuard service offerings on the CarOffer platform, which are accounted for under ASC 460.

45-Day Guarantee is an arrangement through which a selling dealer lists a car on the CarOffer platform, and the Company provides an offer to purchase the vehicle listed at a specified price at any time over a 45-day period. This provides the seller with a put option, where they have the right, but not the obligation, to require the Company to purchase the vehicle during this window. OfferGuard is an arrangement through which a buying dealer purchases a car on the CarOffer platform, and the Company provides an offer to purchase the vehicle at a specified price between days 1 and 3, and days 42 and 45 if the dealer is not able to sell the vehicle after 42 days.

A guarantee liability is initially measured using the amount of consideration received from the dealer for the purchase of the guarantee. The initial liability is released, and guarantee income is recognized, upon the earliest of the following: the vehicle sells during the guarantee period, the seller exercises its put option during the guarantee period, or the option expires unexercised at the end of the guarantee period. Guarantee income is recognized within wholesale revenue in the 
consolidated income statements
. When it is probable and reasonably estimable that the Company will incur a loss on a vehicle that it is required to purchase, a liability and a corresponding charge to wholesale cost of revenue is recognized for the amount of the loss in the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated income statements. Gains and losses resulting from the dealers exercise of guarantees are recognized within wholesale cost of revenue, as appropriate, in the consolidated income statements.
Stock‑Based Compensation
For stock‑based awards granted under the Company’s stock‑based compensation plans, the fair value of each award is determined on the date of grant.
For restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted subject to service-based vesting conditions, the fair value is determined on the date of grant using the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $
0.001
 per share (the “Class A common stock”), as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. RSUs granted subject to service-based vesting conditions generally vest over a 
four-year
 requisite service period.
For RSUs granted subject to market-based vesting conditions, the fair value is determined on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation lattice model. The determination of the fair value using this model is affected by the Company’s stock price performance relative to the companies listed on the S&P 500, and a number of assumptions including volatility, correlation coefficient, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. RSUs previously granted subject to market-based vesting conditions vest upon achievement of specified levels of market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company modified its market-based performance awards to contain only service-based vesting conditions in line with the Company’s other RSU awards. 
As a result, there were 
no
 market-based RSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, or December 31, 2022.
For stock options granted, the fair value is determined on the date of grant using the Black‑Scholes option‑pricing model. The determination of the fair value is affected by the Company’s stock price and a number of assumptions including expected dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected term. For expected volatility, the Company uses a blended volatility to

92

Table of Contents

combine the historical volatility of trading with the volatility for a peer group of companies as the Company does not have historical stock prices for a period that is at least equal to the expected term. 
Stock options granted generally have a term of 
ten years
 from the date of grant and generally vest over a 
four-year
 requisite service period. 
There were 
no
 stock options granted during the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The weighted average assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 
2022, were as follows:

The Company issues shares of Class A common stock upon the vesting of RSUs and the exercise of stock options out of its shares available for issuance. During the year ended December 31, 2023, prior to the redemption of all awards in connection with the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, the Company would issue CO Incentive Units and Subject Units (as each term is defined below) out of CarOffer’s units available for issuance.

The Company accounts for forfeitures when they occur.
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, with the amount of compensation expense recognized at any date at least equaling the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date.
The tax effect of differences between tax deductions related to stock compensation and the corresponding financial statement expense compensation are recognized as an income tax benefit or expense within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated income statements. The permanent differences, including excess tax benefits and expenses, are recognized within accrued expenses, accrued income taxes, and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The temporary differences are recognized within deferred tax assets in the consolidated balance sheets and classified as deferred taxes in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
CarOffer
On 
January 14, 2021
, the Company acquired a 
51
% interest in CarOffer (the “2021 CarOffer Transaction”) pursuant to the terms of a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “2021 Purchase Agreement”) dated as of December 9, 2020 (the “2021 Agreement Date”), as amended, by and among the Company, CarOffer, CarOffer Investors Holding, LLC (“TopCo”), each of the Members of TopCo (each a “Member” and collectively, the “Members”), and Bruce T. Thompson, an individual who resided in Texas.

Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the 2021 Purchase Agreement (the “2021 Closing”), the Company acquired a 
51
% interest in CarOffer for an aggregate consideration of $
173,155
 (the “2021 Total Consideration”), such 2021 Total Consideration consisting of (a) shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate amount of $
103,645
 (the “2021 Stock Consideration”) and (b) $
69,510
 in cash (the “2021 Cash Consideration”). The number of shares of Class A common stock issued following the 2021 Closing in connection with the 2021 Stock Consideration was 
3,115,282
, which was calculated by reference to a value of $
22.51
 per share, which equals the volume-weighted average closing price per share of Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the 28 consecutive trading days ending on the third Business Day (as defined in the 2021 Purchase Agreement) preceding the 2021 Agreement Date. Pursuant to the 2021 Purchase Agreement, the remaining equity in CarOffer (the “Remaining Equity”) was retained by the then-current equity holders of CarOffer and subject to certain call and put arrangements discussed below.
Pursuant to the 2021 Purchase Agreement, the Company established a retention pool in an aggregate amount of $
8,000
 in the form of RSUs to be issued pursuant to the Company’s standard form of RSU agreement under the Company’s Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2017 Plan”), (i) $
6,000
 of which was granted to certain CarOffer employees following the 2021 Closing in accordance with the terms of the 2021 Purchase Agreement and (ii) $
2,000
 of 
which was available for issuance to future CarOffer

employees 
in accordance with the terms of the 2021 Purchase Agreement. RSUs issued from the retention pool would have been subject to vesting based on rendering of future services.
In addition, the Company, TopCo, each Member, and CarOffer MidCo, LLC entered into the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, dated as of December 9, 2020 (the “2020 CarOffer Operating Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other matters, the Company secured the right to appoint a majority of the members of the Board of Managers of CarOffer, other rights customary for a transaction of this nature, and the put and call rights described below. On November 23, 2021, the 2020 CarOffer Operating Agreement was amended and restated for administrative purposes, including principally to recapitalize certain of the membership units thereunder without changing overall consideration payable by the Company thereunder (the “2021 CarOffer Operating Agreement”).
In the second half of 2022, the Company had a call right (the “2022 Call Right”), exercisable in its sole discretion, to acquire a portion of the Remaining Equity representing up to 
25
% of the fully diluted capitalization of CarOffer (such acquired Remaining Equity, the “2022 Acquired Remaining Equity”) at an implied CarOffer value (the “2022 Call Right Value”) of seven times CarOffer’s trailing twelve months gross profit as of June 30, 2022 (calculated in accordance with the defined terms and subject to the adjustments set forth in the 2021 CarOffer Operating Agreement). 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company determined not to exercise the 2022 Call Right.
Prior to the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, in the second half of 2024, (a) the Company had a call right (the “2024 Call Right”), exercisable in its sole discretion, to acquire all, and not less than all, of the Remaining Equity that it had not yet acquired pursuant to the 2022 Call Right and the 2021 Closing, at the greater of (i) (x) $
100.0
 million, and (y) the 2022 Call Right Value, whichever was less, and (ii) an implied CarOffer value of 12 times CarOffer’s trailing 12 months EBITDA as of June 30, 2024 (in each case calculated in accordance with the defined terms and subject to the adjustments set forth in the 2021 CarOffer Operating Agreement), and (b) the representative of the holders of the Remaining Equity had a put right (the “2024 Put Right”), exercisable in his, her or their sole discretion, to have the holders of the Remaining Equity sell to the Company, all, and not less than all, of the Remaining Equity at an implied CarOffer value of 12 times CarOffer’s trailing 12 months EBITDA as of June 30, 2024 (calculated in accordance with the defined terms and subject to the adjustments set forth in the 2021 CarOffer Operating Agreement). In connection with the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, the 2024 Call Right and the 2024 Put Right were terminated.
In connection with the 2021 CarOffer Transaction, the then-outstanding unvested incentive units (“CO Incentive Units”) of CarOffer and unvested Class CO CarOffer units (the “Subject Units”) remained outstanding and would have vested over the requisite service periods as discussed below.

Grants of the CO Incentive Units were subject to the CarOffer 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, adopted effective November 24, 2020 (the “2020 CO Plan”), the applicable award agreement, and the 2021 CarOffer Operating Agreement. Following the 2021 CarOffer Transaction, remaining unvested CO Incentive Units vest over a period of three years, 
with one-third having vested on each of January 14, 2022, and January 14, 2023, and one-third vesting on January 14, 2024, provided that a grantee’s continuous service to CarOffer has not terminated on the applicable vesting date.
 As a result of the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, the vesting on January 14, 2024, was accelerated and the CO Incentive Units were accelerated and redeemed.
In addition to the 2020 CO Plan, on December 9, 2020, CarOffer entered into a Vesting Agreement (the “Vesting Agreement”) regarding the vesting of Subject Units beneficially owned by Bruce Thompson, the founder and CEO of CarOffer, and certain affiliated persons (collectively, the “T5 Holders”) in connection with the Company’s then-anticipated acquisition of a 
51
% interest in CarOffer. Pursuant to the Vesting Agreement, 
432,592
 Subject Units beneficially owned by the T5 Holders vest in three approximately equal installments, 
with one-third having vested on each of January 14, 2022, and January 14, 2023, and one third vesting on January 14, 2024, subject to the terms of the Vesting Agreement.
 As a result of the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, the vesting on January 14, 2024, was accelerated and the Subject Units were accelerated and redeemed.

In connection with the 2021 Closing, CarOffer reserved 
228,571
 incentive 
units (the “2021 Incentive Units”) for purposes of establishing an employee incentive equity plan. Thereafter, CarOffer formed CarOffer Incentive Equity, LLC (“CIE”), a Delaware manager-managed limited liability company managed by the Company, and established the CIE 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 CO Plan”). The 2021 CO Plan and related documentation, including the applicable award agreement, a vesting agreement between CarOffer and CIE, and the 2021 CarOffer Operating Agreement, provided for an incentive equity grant structure whereby 2021 Incentive Units would be granted to CIE and 2021 CO Plan grantees would receive an associated equity interest in CIE (the “CIE Interest”), with back-to-back vesting between the 2021 Incentive Units and the associated CIE Interest. Subject to any modifications

that 
may have been approved by the CarOffer Board of Managers in its discretion, grants under the 2021 CO Plan would vest over a period of three years from the grant date, one-third each on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the applicable grant date, provided that a grantee’s continuous service to CarOffer had not terminated on the applicable anniversary of the grant date. Upon termination of a grantee’s continuous service to CarOffer, all of such grantee’s unvested 2021 Incentive Units were forfeited. As of December 31, 2022, there were no grants of 2021 Incentive Units under the 2021 CO Plan.

CO Incentive Units, Subject Units, and 2021 Incentive Units were liability-classified awards because the awards could be put to the Company at a formula price such that the holders did not bear the risks and rewards associated with equity ownership. For liability-classified awards, the fair value was determined on the date of issuance using a Least Square Monte Carlo simulation model. Liability-classified awards were remeasured to fair value each period until settlement. Until March 31, 2022, the Least Square Monte Carlo simulation model was used for remeasurement. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company refined its model for determining the fair value of liability-classified awards as a result of obtaining gross profit actuals through the trailing twelve-months ended June 30, 2022, measurement period for the first call option. From March 31, 2022, the fair value was typically determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company determined not to exercise the 2022 Call Right. The valuation of these liability-classified awards was previously derived from the 2024 Call Right and the 2024 Put Right. The determination of the fair value was affected by CarOffer’s equity value, EBITDA, and Excess Parent Capital (as defined in the 2021 CarOffer Operating Agreement) that drove the exercise price of future call/put rights, as well as a number of assumptions including market price of risk, volatility, correlation, and risk-free interest rate. As a result of the EBITDA and Excess Parent Capital projections for CarOffer as of December 31, 2022, a Monte Carlo simulation model was not required as of December 31, 2022.
On December 1, 2023, the Company completed the 2023 CarOffer Transaction. Pursuant to the 2023 Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired the remaining minority equity interests in CarOffer for the 2023 Consideration, consisting of an aggregate consideration of $
75.0
 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the 2023 Purchase Agreement. A portion of the 2023 Consideration was held in escrow to secure certain payment and indemnification obligations of the Indirect Members in accordance with the terms of the 2023 Purchase Agreement.
Upon completion of the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, the Company recorded an approximately $
50
 million stock-based compensation charge, which consisted of payments for CO Incentive Units and Subject Units, and payments made to holders of noncontrolling interest (
“Noncontrolling Interest Units”
), resulting from the modification of the 2021 Purchase Agreement. As a result of the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, the liability-classified awards were accelerated and redeemed as of December 31, 2023. The completion of the 2023 CarOffer Transaction additionally relieved the redeemable noncontrolling interests on its consolidated balance sheets, reducing the remaining redeemable noncontrolling interest on its consolidated balance sheets to 
zero
 and recording excess cash paid to these unit holders as a deemed dividend of $
5,838
. See Note 11 of these consolidated financial statements for further disclosure on impact of the modifications that resulted from the 2023 CarOffer Transaction.
Following the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, CarOffer is a wholly-owned subsidiary and the Company entered into the 2023 CarOffer Operating Agreement, pursuant to which, among other matters, the existing put and call rights were terminated.
Common Stock Share Repurchases
Repurchases of the Company’s Class A common stock that are retired are recognized as a reduction to common stock at par value and the remainder is recognized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. If additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, repurchases of the Company’s Class A common stock in excess of the par value are recognized as a reduction to retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets.
If there is a difference between the trade date and the settlement date for shares repurchased as of period end, a liability is recognized within accrued expenses, accrued income taxes, and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
As a result of the IRA, effective on January 1, 2023, the Company is required to pay a 
1
% excise tax on certain stock repurchases. Based on the Company’s evaluation, the Company has concluded that the IRA has not had a material impact on its income tax provision and cash taxes. The excise tax is considered a direct and incremental cost of the share repurchase and is recognized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. Other direct and incremental costs, such as commissions and legal expenses, are recognized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, capitalized website development decreased

 impairment of capitalized website development costs and a $
4,901
 disposal of fully depreciated assets, due to the end of the CG Buy Online pilot, which allowed consumers to purchase vehicles online, within the Digital Wholesale segment. Additionally, the decrease was driven by a $
3,470
 disposal of fully depreciated assets for the Company’s peer-to-peer product, which the Company is no longer offering, within the U.S. Marketplace segment. The decrease was also due in part to a $
180
 impairment related to certain developed technology that the Company decided to cease investment, within the Digital Wholesale segment. For further discussion of impairments, see Note 6 of these consolidated financial statements. These decreases were offset in part by $
23,853
 gross capitalized website development costs.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, capitalized equipment, furniture and fixtures, and leasehold improvements increased 
$

374
, $
2,005
, and $
4,508
, for capitalized equipment, furniture and fixtures, and leasehold improvements, respectively, related to fully depreciated assets for leases of space which the Company no longer occupies, within the U.S. Marketplace segment. The Company additionally disposed of $
480
 in leasehold improvements related to the disposal of building plans for CarOffer, within the Digital Wholesale segment. The Company also 
impaired
 $

 of furniture and fixtures due to the end of the CG Buy Online pilot, within the Digital Wholesale segment. For further discussion of impairments, see Note 6 of these consolidated financial statements.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, capitalized internal-use software increased

6. Impairments of Goodwill and Other Assets
CarOffer Impairment
Background
During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company identified a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test at the CarOffer reporting unit due to recent organizational changes and Transaction volume declines, which resulted in revisions to the Company’s financial projections for the CarOffer reporting unit. The Company performed the interim impairment test as of June 30, 2024.
Prior to testing the goodwill and other long-lived assets included in the CarOffer reporting unit for impairment, the Company first evaluated current assets, inclusive of the cash and cash-equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, and other current assets allocated to the CarOffer reporting unit, under applicable guidance and identified no impairment.

The Company then evaluated other long-lived assets included in the CarOffer reporting unit under ASC 360, 
Property, Plant, and Equipment
 (“ASC 360”). Other long-lived assets were tested for impairment at the asset group level. The Company identified the asset group as the entire CarOffer reporting unit, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. As the CarOffer asset group did not pass the step one recoverability test on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the Company then compared the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value. To estimate the fair value of the asset group, the Company utilized an income-based valuation approach by means of a discounted cash flow method, based on market participant assumptions. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value using a discounted cash flow method included forecasted revenue and EBITDA, long term expectations for growth rates and operating profit margin, expected needs for annual capital expenditure and net working capital, and a market-participant discount rate derived via the capital asset pricing model. The excess of the carrying value of the asset group over the fair value was first allocated amongst the long-lived asset group (excluding goodwill), noting each individual long-lived asset within the group may not be impaired below its individual fair value.
As discussed below, the Company recognized impairments of CarOffer right-of-use assets of $
4,731
 and the CarOffer brand intangible asset of $
7,538
 to bring the long-lived assets’ carrying value to fair value. All other long-lived assets’ carrying value were at or below fair value. Subsequent to performing the impairment assessment of its long-lived assets, the Company then assessed goodwill included in the CarOffer reporting unit, resulting in an impairment charge of $
115,206
, inclusive of the deferred tax impact of $
28,437
 due to the goodwill being tax deductible. See below for further details of each impairment charge.
Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized a $
127,475
 impairment to the CarOffer reporting unit, reducing its carrying value to its fair value.

Due to the partial impairment of the CarOffer reporting unit goodwill and other long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2024, in which the CarOffer reporting unit was reduced to its fair value, there remains a risk for future impairment charges if projected future operating results further decline, including as a result of economic conditions or operational challenges, which could be material and negatively affect its operations.
Right-of-Use Asset
In connection with the triggering event discussed above, the Company recognized an impairment to the right-of-use asset associated with CarOffer’s Addison, Texas lease included within the CarOffer asset group as of June 30, 2024, to reduce the carrying value of the right-of-use asset to fair value.
The fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as there were significant unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation technique. The Company estimated fair value using the discounted cash flow method, with key inputs including the selected market rental rates based upon similar office spaces, the discount rate, and other estimated replacement costs.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, a non-cash impairment charge of 
$
4,731
 was allocated to the right-of-use assets in the CarOffer asset group, which was recognized within impairment operating expenses in the consolidated income statements in the Digital Wholesale segment.

In connection with the triggering event discussed above, the Company recognized an impairment to the brand intangible asset included within the CarOffer asset group as of June 30, 2024, to reduce the carrying value of the brand intangible asset to fair value.

The fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as there were significant unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation technique. The Company estimated fair value using market participant assumptions and the relief from royalty method, with key inputs including forecasted revenue, royalty rate, discount rate, and the useful life.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, a non-cash impairment charge of $
7,538
 was allocated to the brand intangible asset in the CarOffer asset group, which was recognized within impairment operating expenses in the consolidated income statements in the Digital Wholesale segment.
For further information on the Company’s intangible assets, see Note 7 of these consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill
The Company determined that there were no indicators of impairment for the U.S. Marketplace or U.K. Marketplace reporting units and, therefore, an interim impairment assessment was not performed as of June 30, 2024.
In connection with the triggering event discussed above, the Company recognized an impairment to the CarOffer reporting unit goodwill as of June 30, 2024, to reduce the carrying value of the CarOffer reporting unit goodwill to fair value.

The fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as there were significant unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation technique. The Company estimated the fair value of the CarOffer reporting unit using an income-based valuation approach by means of a discounted cash flow method. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit included forecasted revenue and EBITDA, long term expectations for growth rates and operating profit margin, expected needs for annual capital expenditure and net working capital, and a market-participant discount rate derived via the capital asset pricing model.
As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value for the CarOffer reporting unit (after adjustments for other long-lived asset impairments discussed above) exceeded its fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2024, a non-cash impairment charge of $
86,769
 was recognized within impairment operating expenses in the consolidated income statements in the Digital Wholesale segment. As the goodwill for the CarOffer reporting unit is tax deductible, the Company calculated the deferred tax effect of the goodwill impairment charge using the simultaneous equation method. This resulted in additional goodwill impairment and deferred tax assets of $
28,437
, for a total goodwill impairment of $
115,206
 recognized within impairment operating expenses in the consolidated income statements in the Digital Wholesale segment.
For further information on the Company’s goodwill, see Note 7 of these consolidated financial statements.
CG Buy Online Impairment
During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company decided to end its CG Buy Online pilot in order to redirect those resources toward other investment opportunities, including continued product innovation and development across the business. The CG Buy Online pilot was one of the initiatives that allowed consumers to purchase vehicles online. The pilot ended on October 31, 2024.

This was identified as a triggering event for long-lived asset impairment testing under ASC 360. Other long-lived assets were tested for impairment at the asset group level. The Company identified the asset group as the CG Buy Online Pilot assets, which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. These assets were included in the CG Buy Online reporting unit. As the asset group did not pass the step one recoverability test on an undiscounted cash flow basis, the Company then compared the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value. As the Company decided to end this pilot, the estimated future cash flows and related fair value were both $
0
. There was no goodwill associated with the CG Buy Online reporting unit.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023

 long-term debt outstanding.
Revolving Credit Facility
On September 26, 2022, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent and an L/C Issuer (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and the other lenders, L/C Issuers, and parties thereto from time to time (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement consists of a revolving credit facility (the “2022 Revolver”), which allows the Company to borrow up to $
400.0
 million, $
50.0
 million of which may be comprised of a letter of credit sub-facility (the “2022 Revolver Sub-facility”). The borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement may be increased in accordance with the terms and subject to the adjustments as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Specifically, the borrowing capacity may be increased by an amount up to the greater of $
250.0
 million or 
100
% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) if certain criteria are met and subject to certain restrictions. Any such increase requires lender approval. Proceeds of any borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. The 2022 Revolver is scheduled to mature on 
September 26, 2027
.

The applicable interest rate is, at the Company’s option, based on a number of different benchmark rates and applicable spreads, based on the ratio of the outstanding principal amount of the Company’s secured indebtedness to the trailing four quarters of consolidated EBITDA (as determined under the Credit Agreement, the “Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio”). The Credit Agreement also requires the Company to pay a commitment fee to the lenders with respect of the unutilized revolving commitments at a rate ranging from 
0.125
% to 
0.175
% per annum based on the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as determined on a quarterly basis.
The 2022 Revolver is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all tangible and intangible property of the Company, as well as any future guarantors, and pledges of the equity of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, in each case subject to certain exceptions, limitations, and exclusions from the collateral. The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default and requires the Company to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant requiring that the Company not exceed certain Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio ranges at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2024.

1001 Boylston Street
On September 20, 2024, the Company began occupying 1001 Boylston Street and all assets capitalized through that date were placed into service. As of December 31, 2024, the Company completed its buildout and all remaining assets associated with the 1001 Boylston Street lease were placed into service.
On April 12, 2024 and May 3, 2024, the Company entered into various change orders regarding the 1001 Boylston Street lease and related buildout. The change orders modify the responsibilities outlined in the 1001 Boylston Street lease and reallocate the responsibility of certain buildout costs from the landlord to the Company. The costs related to this work are reimbursable by the landlord, effectively increasing the tenant improvement allowance from the 1001 Boylston Street lease by $
456
. The Company accounted for these change orders as a remeasurement of the 1001 Boylston Street lease, using an incremental borrowing rate as of the modification date. The lease remeasurement resulted in a decrease in the lease liability and right-of-use asset on the consolidated balance sheets of $
1,493
. There was not a material impact on the consolidated income statements or future minimum lease payments.

On March 19, 2024, the Company entered into a letter agreement regarding the 1001 Boylston Street lease (the "2024 Letter Agreement"). The 2024 Letter Agreement memorializes the Substantial Completion Date, Commencement Date, Fixed Rent Commencement Date (as each term is defined in the 1001 Boylston Street lease), and the rental credits and holdover compensation owed to the Company per the 1001 Boylston Street lease. The 2024 Letter Agreement also modifies the parking privileges and payments, which commenced on June 1, 2024, and provides reimbursement from the landlord to the Company for additional unexpected costs incurred. The Company accounted for the 2024 Letter Agreement as a remeasurement of the 1001 Boylston Street lease, using an incremental borrowing rate as of the modification date. The lease remeasurement resulted in a decrease in the lease liability and right-of-use asset on the consolidated balance sheets of $
3,536
. There was not a material impact on the consolidated income statements or future minimum lease payments.

Lease Expenses
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized 
$
33,498
, 
$
34,218
, and 
$
16,732
, 
respectively, of lease costs, which includes operating lease costs, finance lease costs, and variable lease payments. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $
6,699
 of variable lease payments. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, variable lease payments were immaterial.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized 
$
2,011
, 
$
1,897
, and $
1,809
, respectively, of sublease income.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average remaining lease term was 
12.8
 years and 
13.1
 years, respectively, and the weighted average discount rate was 
6.2
%
 and 
5.7
%
, respectively. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow a similar amount on a collateralized basis over a similar term. The Company has no historical debt transactions and a collateralized rate is estimated based on a group of peer companies. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate on January 1, 2019, for leases that commenced prior to that date.

Tax Contingencies
We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate, which could include sales and use tax, value added tax, excise tax, gross receipts tax, and property tax. State, local, and foreign jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value added, and other taxes. These rules and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations that may change over time due to new court interpretations and newly enacted rules and regulations. As a result, we could face the possibility of tax assessments and audits, and our liability for these taxes and associated penalties could exceed our original estimates, which could be material.
Legal Matters
From time to time, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. The Company recognizes a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. The Company is not presently subject to any pending or threatened litigation that it believes, if determined adversely to the Company, individually or taken together, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its business or financial results. However, litigation is inherently unpredictable and the future outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies may be unexpected or differ from the Company’s estimated liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future financial results.

11. Stock‑based Compensation
CarGurus Equity Incentive Plans
The Company’s Amended and Restated 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) provided for the issuance of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, and stock awards to the Company’s employees, officers, directors, and consultants. The 2006 Plan authorized up to an aggregate of 
3,444,668
 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock for such issuances. In conjunction with the effectiveness of the Company’s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”), the Board voted that 
no
 further stock options or other equity-based awards may be granted under the 2006 Plan.
In 2015 the Board adopted the 2015 Plan, which became effective on June 26, 2015. The 2015 Plan provided for the issuance of stock-based incentives to employees, consultants, and non-employee directors. As of the effective date of the 2015 Plan, up to 
603,436
 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan was amended and restated effective August 6, 2015, to permit the granting of RSUs under the 2015 Plan, to remove Class B common stock from the pool of shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan, and to make certain other desired changes. The 2015 Plan was further amended and restated at October 15, 2015, to add a 
ten-year
 term and to make certain other desired changes.
The 2015 Plan was further amended and restated effective August 22, 2016, to merge the 2006 Plan into the 2015 Plan, to increase the number of shares of Class A common stock that may be issued under the 2015 Plan, and to lengthen the term of the 2015 Plan to expire on 
August 21, 2026
. In addition, pursuant to this amendment and restatement of the 2015 Plan, prior to giving effect to the recapitalization that occurred on June 21, 2017, there were (i) 
618,691
 shares of Class A common stock, plus (ii) 
802,562
 shares of Class B common stock authorized under the 2015 Plan; provided, however, that

In connection with the recapitalization that occurred on June 21, 2017, the 2015 Plan was further amended and restated to account for each outstanding common stock option being adjusted such that each share of common stock underlying such option became 
two
 shares of Class A common stock and 
four
 shares of Class B common stock underlying such option, and each outstanding RSU being adjusted such that each share of common stock issuable upon settlement of such RSU became 
two
 shares of Class A common stock and 
four
 shares of Class B common stock issuable upon settlement of such RSU. Pursuant to the 2015 Plan as further amended in connection with the recapitalization, there were (i) 
3,181,740
 shares of Class A common stock and (ii) 
5,161,644
 shares of Class B common stock authorized for issuance under the 2015 Plan.
In connection with the Company’s initial public offering, in October 2017 the Board adopted, and the Company’s stockholders approved, the 2017 Plan for the purpose of granting incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock awards, stock units, other share-based awards, and cash awards to employees, advisors, and consultants to the Company and its subsidiaries and non-employee members of the Board. The 2017 Plan is the successor to the 2015 Plan. The 2017 Plan authorizes the issuance or transfer of the sum of: (i) 
7,800,000
 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, plus (ii) the number of shares of Class A common stock (up to 
4,500,000
 shares) equal to the sum of (x) the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock of the Company subject to outstanding awards under the 2015 Plan as of October 10, 2017, that terminate, expire, or are canceled, forfeited, exchanged, or surrendered on or after October 10, 2017, without having been exercised, vested, or paid prior to October 10, 2017, including shares tendered or withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to outstanding grants under the 2015 Plan, plus (y) the number of shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan that remained available for grant under the 2015 Plan as of October 10, 2017. The aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock that may be issued or transferred under the 2017 Plan pursuant to incentive stock options will not exceed 
12,300,000
 shares of Class A common stock. Any shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations return to the authorized, but unissued, pool under the 2017 Plan and can be reissued by the Company. In conjunction with the adoption of the 2017 Plan, options and RSUs that were outstanding at that time under the 2015 Plan remained outstanding but no additional grants may be made from the 2015 Plan.
Unless determined otherwise by the Compensation Committee of the Board, as of the first trading day of January of each calendar year during the term of the 2017 Plan (excluding any extensions), eligible beginning with calendar year 2019, an additional number of shares of Class A common stock will be added to the number of shares of Class A common stock authorized to be issued or transferred under the 2017 Plan and the number of shares authorized to be issued or transferred pursuant to incentive stock options, equal to 
4
% of the total number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding on the last trading day in December of the immediately preceding calendar year, or 
6,000,000
 shares, whichever is less, or such lesser amount as determined by the Board (the “Evergreen Increase”).

12. Earnings Per Share
The Company has two classes of common stock authorized: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to 
one
 vote per share
 and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 
ten
 votes per share
. 
Each share of Class B common stock is convertible into 
one
 share of Class A common stock
 at the option of the holder at any time or automatically upon certain events described in the Company’s fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including upon either the death or voluntary termination of the Company’s Executive Chair.
 The Company allocates undistributed earnings attributable to common stock between the common stock classes on a 
one‑to‑one
 basis when computing net income per share. As a result, basic and diluted net income per share of Class A common stock and per share of Class B common stock are equivalent.
During the year ended December 31, 2024
, 
1,012,428
 shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
no
 shares of Class B common stock were converted into Class A common stock.
Basic net income per share (“Basic EPS”) is computed by dividing consolidated net income adjusted for net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, deemed dividends on redemption of noncontrolling interest, and changes in the redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interest, if applicable, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. The Company computes the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period using the total number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding as of the last day of the previous year plus the weighted-average of any additional shares issued and outstanding during the reporting period, less the weighted-average of any shares repurchased during the period.
Diluted net income per share (“Diluted EPS”) gives effect to all potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing consolidated net income adjusted for net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest, deemed dividends on redemption of noncontrolling interest, and changes in the redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interest, if applicable and dilutive, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period using (i) the number of shares of common stock used in the Basic EPS calculation as indicated above, (ii) if dilutive, the incremental weighted-average common stock that the Company would issue upon the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs, and (iii) if dilutive, market-based performance awards based on the number of shares that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period assuming the end of the reporting period was also the end of the contingency period. The dilutive effect of these common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the if-converted method was used to calculate the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the 2024 Put Right, inclusive of CarOffer noncontrolling interest and CO Incentive and Subject Units, that would have been issuable as of the end of the reporting period assuming the end of the reporting period was also the end of the contingency period.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the effective tax rate attributable to CarGurus, Inc. was

, which is lower
 than the statutory tax rate of 
21
%, principally due to federal and state research and development credits and the tax benefits of CarOffer acquisition related adjustment, partially offset by state and local income taxes, non-deductible meals, entertainment, and transportation expenses, and the Section 162 (m) excess officer compensation limitation.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the effective tax rate attributable to CarGurus, Inc. was 
44.5
%
, which is greater than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes inclusive of the impact from the recently passed Massachusetts apportionment tax rule, shortfalls on the taxable compensation of share-based awards, the Section 162(m) excess officer compensation limitation, and tax impact associated with the 2023 CarOffer Transaction, partially offset by federal and state research and development tax credits.

For the year ended December 31, 2022
, the effective tax rate attributable to CarGurus, Inc. was 
27.7
%, which is greater than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes, the exclusion of loss from investment in partnership, shortfalls on the taxable compensation of share-based awards, and the Section 162(m) excess officer compensation limitation, partially offset by federal and state research and development tax credits.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, valuation allowances were immaterial. Based upon the level of historical U.S. earnings and future projections over the period in which the net deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, with the exception of the deferred tax asset related to intangible assets in Ireland. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the change in the valuation allowance was 
$
19
 and $
47
, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
no
 federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and had state NOL carryforwards of 
$
3,099
. The federal NOL carryforward, subject to an annual limitation of 
80
% of taxable income, does not expire. The state NOL carryforwards expire at various dates through 
2040
. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of 
$
660
 and 
$
322
, respectively, available to reduce future tax liabilities. The federal tax credit carryforward expires in 2040. The state tax credit carryforwards indefinitely as it is related to California. Utilization of the NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future, as provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 382”), as well as similar state provisions. Ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL or tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, 
an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions that increase the ownership of 5% stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than 
50
% in the aggregate over a 
three-year
 period.

The Company permanently reinvests the earnings, if any, of its foreign subsidiaries and, therefore, does not provide for U.S. income taxes that could result from the distribution of those earnings to the Company. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these earnings was immaterial.
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and in various foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s tax filings remain subject to audits by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time following the tax year to which those filings relate. Tax years 
2021
 and forward generally remain open for examination for federal and state tax purposes. Tax years 
2020
 and forward generally remain open for examination for foreign tax purposes.

14. Segment and Geographic Information
Effective as of the fourth quarter of 2022 the Company revised its segment reporting from 
one
 reportable segment to 
two
 reportable segments, U.S. Marketplace and Digital Wholesale. The change in segment reporting was a triggering event for an evaluation of goodwill impairment. As such, the Company evaluated for goodwill impairment on December 31, 2022, and did not identify any impairment to its goodwill. The change in segment reporting was made to align with financial reporting results regularly provided to the Company’s CODM, Jason Trevisan, 
Chief Executive Officer
, to assess the business. 
Segment information is presented in the same manner as the CODM reviews the Company’s operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM reviews segment revenue and segment income (loss) from operations as a proxy for the performance of the Company’s operations. The CODM uses segment income (loss) from operations in the annual budgeting and monthly forecasting process. The CODM considers segment income (loss) from operations in analyses of the actual amounts against budgeted and forecasted values to evaluate the performance of each segment and to make decisions for the allocation of capital and other resources to each segment.
The U.S. Marketplace segment derives revenue from marketplace services from customers within the U.S. The Digital Wholesale segment primarily derives revenue from Dealer-to-Dealer and Instant Max Cash Offer services and products which are sold on the CarOffer platform. The Company also has two operating segments which are individually immaterial and, therefore, aggregated into the Other category to reconcile reportable segments to the consolidated income statements. The Other category derives revenue from marketplace services from customers outside of the U.S.
Revenue and costs discretely incurred by reportable segments, including depreciation and amortization, are included in the calculation of reportable segment income (loss) from operations. Digital Wholesale segment loss from operations also reflects certain Instant Max Cash Offer marketing and lead generation fees allocated from the U.S. Marketplace segment.

The Company’s significant segment expenses consist of cost of revenue and sales and marketing expense. The Company’s other segment items consist of product, technology, and development expense and general and administrative expense. The Company has disclosed depreciation and amortization expense separately from other segment items to meet disclosure requirements.
Asset information by reportable segment is not provided to the CODM as asset information is assessed and reviewed on a consolidated basis.

Item 9A. Controls 
and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report.

The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As described below, based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, management has remediated the material weakness initially identified in 2022. As a result, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported as and when required.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has concluded that our financial statements included in this Annual Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with GAAP.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;

122

Table of Contents

(ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and

(iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).

Based on this assessment and those criteria, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024, and that our previously reported material weakness at our CarOffer subsidiary for the prior fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, has been remediated.

Previously Identified Material Weakness

We previously concluded that this material weakness existed at our CarOffer subsidiary as CarOffer did not have the necessary business and information technology, or IT, processes, personnel, and related internal controls to operate in a manner to satisfy the accounting and financial reporting requirements of a public company.

The deficiencies at our CarOffer subsidiary were the result of operating deficiencies related to certain controls over IT systems that are relevant to the preparation of our financial statements.

This material weakness did not result in a known material misstatement to our financial statements. However, the material weakness could have resulted in material misstatements in our interim or annual financial statements and disclosures which then may not have been prevented or detected.

Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weakness

We and our Board of Directors are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. Management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, evaluated the material weakness initially identified during the second quarter of 2022 and implemented a remediation plan to address the material weakness and enhance our control environment.

Management has implemented changes to strengthen our internal controls since the period when the material weakness was identified. These changes were intended to address the unremediated material weakness from 2022 that remained during the year ended December 31, 2023. During 2023 our remediation efforts were focused on continued employee training related to internal control over financial reporting and confirming sustained operation of effectively designed control activities, including IT general controls.

As of December 31, 2024, all remediation efforts have been completed by management and applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time. Management concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. As a result, management concluded that the prior year’s material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting has been remediated as of December 31, 2024.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Except as noted in the preceding paragraphs, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Di
rectors of CarGurus, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited CarGurus, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, CarGurus, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the finan
cial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
