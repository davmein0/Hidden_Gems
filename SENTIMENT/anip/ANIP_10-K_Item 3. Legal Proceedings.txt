Executive Overview
ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (together, “ANI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a diversified bio-pharmaceutical company committed to its mission of “Serving Patients, Improving Lives” by developing, manufacturing, and commercializing innovative and high quality therapeutics. 
On September 16, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Alimera Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 21, 2024 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Alimera and ANIP Merger Sub INC., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Alimera, with Alimera surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger, the Company added a growing and durable franchise, ILUVIEN® (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.19 mg, which has received marketing authorization and reimbursement in the United States (“U.S.”) and 24 countries for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (“DME”) and YUTIQ® (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.18 mg, available in the U.S. for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye (“NIU-PS”). In connection with the acquisition of Alimera, the Company has assessed its strategic goals and aligned its operational initiatives into two reportable segments, and the discussion of the historical results of operations below has been revised, as applicable, to be consistent with the presentation of the revised reportable segments (see Note 19 "Segment Reporting in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).  
Our three pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, of which two are located in Baudette, Minnesota, and one is located in East Windsor, New Jersey, are together capable of producing oral solid dose products, as well as semi-solids, liquids and topicals, controlled substances, and potent products that must be manufactured in a fully-contained environment. We ceased operations at our subsidiary in Oakville, Ontario, Canada as of March 31, 2023. This action was part of ongoing initiatives to capture operational synergies following our acquisition of Novitium Pharma LLC (“Novitium”) in November 2021. We have fully completed the transition of the products manufactured or packaged in Oakville to one of our three U.S. based manufacturing sites. In February 2024, our Canadian subsidiary entered into an agreement for the purchase and sale of the Oakville site, for a purchase price of $19.2 million Canadian Dollars, or approximately $14.2 million, based on the current exchange rate. The sale closed on March 28, 2024 (see Note 4 "Restructuring Canada Operations" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). 
On August 13, 2024, the Company entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the financial institutions party thereto as lenders, (the "New Credit Agreement") which provides for aggregate principal commitments consisting of (i) a senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $325.0 million, and (ii) a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate commitment amount of $75.0 million, which may be used for revolving credit loans, swingline loans and letters of credit.
On September 16, 2024, ANI drew the full $325.0 million of New Credit Agreement principal, with proceeds used to finance the acquisition of Alimera, including fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition. As of December 31, 2024, the revolving credit facility remains undrawn, and $75.0 million is available for borrowing, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The New Credit Agreement and the revolving credit facility mature on September 16, 2029.

On August 13, 2024, the Company completed an offering of $316.25 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The Notes are due September 1, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted. After deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions of approximately $9.5 million, but before deducting the Company’s offering expenses, the net proceeds to the Company from the offering of the Notes was approximately $306.8 million. In connection with the offering of Notes, on August 7, 2024 and August 8, 2024, the Company entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (“Capped Calls”). After payment of the cost of entering into the Capped Calls transactions, of approximately $40.6 million, the Company used the remainder of the net proceeds from the Notes offering, together with cash on hand, to repay the Company’s existing senior secured credit agreement with Truist Bank, dated as of November 19, 2021.
In May 2023, through a public offering, the Company completed the issuance and sale of 2,183,545 shares of ANI common stock, resulting in net proceeds after issuance costs of $80.6 million. 
Strategy
Our objective is to build a sustainable and growing biopharmaceutical company serving patients in need and creating long-term value for our investors. Our overall strategy is enabled by an empowered, collaborative, and purposeful team with high performance-orienta
tion that seeks to deliver on our purpose of “Servin
g Patients, Improving Lives.”
Our strategy is driven by the following key growth drivers:
Building a successful Rare Disease and Brands Segment 
We have spent significant time, effort and resources in establishing and expanding our Rare Disease and Brands segment which consists of our Rare Disease and Brands portfolio of products. We plan to continue to expand our Rare Disease business, through a combination of organic growth and acquisition. While we execute against our strategic initiatives that we believe will result in the long-term, sustainable growth and value to our stockholders, we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions of businesses that we believe complement our existing portfolio, infrastructure and capabilities or provide us with the opportunity to expand our existing capabilities. The Brands portion of the segment is comprised of various branded products.
The acquisition of Alimera is anticipated to strengthen our Rare Disease business and expand our footprint beyond the U.S. with the addition of Alimera’s direct marketing operations located in Germany, the United Kingdom, Portugal, and Ireland, as well as its partnerships in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. ILUVIEN and YUTIQ are a durable franchise with high barriers to genericization which the Company believes have a clear role for patients in need of alternative therapeutic options. ANI sees the potential to unlock significant additional growth for the ILUVIEN and YUTIQ franchise through commercial synergies and execution.
Purified

Cortrophin
®
 Gel 
We acquired the NDAs for Purified Cortrophin® Gel (Repository Corticotropin Injection USP) (“Cortrophin Gel”) and Cortrophin-Zinc
TM 
in January 2016 and executed long-term supply agreements with 
a supplier of our primary raw material for corticotrophin API, a supplier of corticotrophin API with whom we have advanced the manufacture of commercial scale batches of API, and a Cortrophin Gel fill/finish contract manufacturer. 
On October 29, 2021, the FDA approved the Company’s Supplemental New Drug Application ("sNDA") for Cortrophin Gel for the treatment of certain chronic autoimmune disorders, including acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis (“MS”) and rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), in addition to excess urinary protein due to nephrotic syndrome. Cortrophin Gel is an adrenocorticotropic hormone (“ACTH”), also known as purified corticotropin. 
On January 24, 2022, we announced the commercial launch of Cortrophin Gel in the U.S. as our foundational Rare Disease asset. 
Throughout 2023 and 2024, we continued to build and invest in our infrastructure to support growth in new areas of opportunity, such as pulmonology, ophthalmology, and gout in the ACTH market. On October 2, 2023, we announced FDA approval and commercial availability of a 1-mLvial of Cortrophin Gel, appropriate for adjunctive treatment of certain patients with acute gouty arthritis flares. 
During the first quarter of 2024, ANI launched a targeted ophthalmology-focused sales force for Cortrophin Gel. The team has continued to gain momentum in ophthalmology, driving significant growth in the number of new patient starts during 2024. Importantly, the addition of Alimera expands the reach of the ophthalmology sales team and we believe there will be significant overlap between high potential prescribers of Cortrophin Gel, ILUVIEN, and YUTIQ.

ILUVIEN and YUTIQ
ILUVIEN (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.19 mg, was developed in the U.S. and internationally for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (“DME”), a leading cause of severe vision loss and blindness, and certain international markets for chronic non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye (“NIU-PS”). We acquired exclusive commercialization rights to YUTIQ (fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant) 0.18 mg, in May 2023 from EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“EyePoint”) for the treatment and prevention of NIU-PS worldwide except for Europe, the Middle East, Africa, (known as ILUVIEN in Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and certain Asian countries including China. ILUVIEN and YUTIQ are state-of-the-art sustained release intravitreal implants that respectively help patients maintain vision longer and reduce disease recurrence. ILUVIEN is being evaluated as baseline therapy in naïve or near naïve patients with early DME in combination with the current standard of care, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (“VEGF”) therapy in the NEW DAY 
clinical trial
. YUTIQ is being further studied in the SYNCHRONICITY Clinical Trial, a prospective, open-label clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of YUTIQ for the treatment and prevention of chronic NIU-PS and related intraocular inflammation. 
Both ILUVIEN and YUTIQ treat patients by delivering a continuous microdose of the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide (“FAc”) in the eye, for up to 36 months. ILUVIEN was developed internally and initially to treat DME, a disease of the retina that affects individuals with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. ILUVIEN is sold to treat DME only in the U.S. YUTIQ is sold to treat NIU-PS only in the U.S. In certain European and Middle Eastern countries, ILUVIEN is approved and commercialized to treat DME and to prevent relapse in recurrent NIU-PS, an inflammatory disease of the uveal tract, which is comprised of the iris, ciliary body and choroid, that can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. We also have rights to commercialize ILUVIEN for NIU-PS in Africa. 
ILUVIEN and YUTIQ are both intravitreal implants that are inserted into the back of the patient’s eye in non-surgical procedures employing devices with 25-gauge needles, which allow for a self-sealing wounds. “Intravitreal” refers to the space inside the eye behind the lens that contains the jelly-like substance called vitreous. The implants, which are non-bioerodible, provide consistent delivery as a result of their constant surface area, permitting elution of FAc to the vitreous. We call this CONTINUOUS MICRODOSING™. This delivery mechanism provides lower daily and aggregate exposure to corticosteroids than any other intraocular dosage forms currently available, which we believe mitigates the typical risks associated with corticosteroid therapy. CONTINUOUS MICRODOSING delivery makes ILUVIEN and YUTIQ the only approved drug therapies for DME and NIU-PS that are designed to deliver consistent daily therapeutic levels of corticosteroid and reduce the recurrence of DME and uveitis for up to three years. Other therapies that physicians currently use to treat DME, such as anti-VEGF treatments and other corticosteroids, are acute (short-acting) therapies that provide a higher initial daily dose but then rapidly decline, requiring frequent reinjection by the physician to maintain an effective dose or reestablish the therapeutic effect after the disease has recurred.
FAc is a non-proprietary corticosteroid and the active compound in ILUVIEN (0.19mg) and YUTIQ (0.18mg). We believe that corticosteroids provide the best option in the treatment of DME and NIU-PS because they reduce the inflammatory aspects of both diseases. ILUVIEN and YUTIQ deliver continuous daily sub-microgram levels of FAc in in vivo release kinetic studies for up to 36 months. ILUVIEN and YUTIQ are the only single injection therapies available to treat retinal diseases consistently every day for up to three years, which may allow patients to see better, longer, with fewer injections. 
Brands
We have grown our brands portfolio of products through acquisition. We have acquired the NDAs for and market Atacand, Atacand HCT, Arimidex, Casodex, Lithobid, Vancocin, Inderal LA, Inderal XL, InnoPran XL, Oxistat, and Veregen. We are innovating in our go-to-market strategy through creative partnerships and a sales force for these products.
Strengthening our Generics and Other segment through continued investment in our generic research and development capability and increased focus on niche opportunities
We have grown our generics business through a combination of market share gains on existing products and new product launches. We have also successfully acquired numerous ANDAs through business and asset acquisitions. Our most recent business acquisition in the Generics and Other segment was the acquisition of Novitium in 2021, which included its portfolio of commercial and pipeline generic products, manufacturing and development facilities and expert workforce. The Novitium acquisition significantly increased our generic pharmaceutical research and development and manufacturing capabiliti
es. We have begun to increase our focus on niche lower competition opportunities such as injectables, Paragraph IV, and competitive generic therapy (“CGT”) designation filings.

Ta
b
l
e
 of Contents
Additionally, we will continue to seek opportunities to enhance our capab
ilities through strategic partnerships and acquisitions of assets and businesses. D
uring 2023, we acquired two ANDAs and one pipeline product from the Chapter 7 Trustee for the estates of Akorn Holding Company and certain of its affiliates, acquired an ANDA and registered patents and pending patent applications from Slayback Pharma Limited Liability Company, and acquired additional ANDAs and product rights for two products in the second half of 2023. 
During 2022, we completed an asset acquisition of four ANDAs from Oakrum Pharma, including two that were co
mmercial at the time of acquisition. 
Generic Product Development Considerations
We consider a variety of criteria in determining which products to develop. These criteria include:
•
Formulation Complexity
. Our development and manufacturing capabilities enable us to manufacture pharmaceuticals that are differentiated

and include high potency, modified release, combination, and hormonal products. This ability to manufacture a variety of differentiated products is a competitive strength that we intend to leverage in selecting products to develop and commercialize.
•
Market Size and Patient Need
. When determining whether to develop or acquire an individual product, we review the current and expected market size for that product and competitive environment. We endeavor to pursue products with sufficient market size to enable us to enter the market with a strong likelihood of serving patients in need and thus being able to price our products both competitively and at a profit.
•
Profit Potential.
 In determining the potential profit of a product, we forecast our anticipated market share, pricing, competitive environment and the estimated cost to manufacture the products.
•
Manufacturing. 
We generally seek to develop and manufacture products at our own manufacturing plants to ensure quality control of our products, supply chain reliability and to more closely control the economic inputs and outputs of our products. 
•
Competition. 
When determining whether to develop or acquire a product, we research existing and expected competition. We seek to develop products for which we can obtain sufficient market share and may decline to develop a product if we anticipate significant competition. Our manufacturing facilities provide a means of entering niche markets, such as hormone therapies, in which fewer generic companies typically compete.
Fiscal 2024 Developments
Acquisition of Alimera Sciences, Inc. 
On September 16, 2024, the Company completed our previously announced merger with Alimera (the “Closing”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Alimera (the “Alimera Common Stock”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time including each Alimera RSA, Alimera PSU, Alimera RSU, and Alimera Warrant (as defined below), but excluding any treasury shares or shares owned by the Company, Merger Subs or any other subsidiary of the Company or Alimera), was canceled and ceased to exist and was converted into the right to receive (i) $5.50 in cash (“Closing Cash Consideration”), and (ii) one contingent value right (a “CVR”), which represents the right to receive the milestone payments (as defined below) subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the CVR Agreement entered into on September 16, 2024 (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the “Merger Consideration”). The Company also repaid $72.5 million of Alimera debt.
Each CVR entitles the holder to receive milestone payments for 2026 and 2027. The milestone payments for each CVR equals the product (rounded to the nearest 1/100 of $0.01) of $0.25 multiplied by a fraction (which is no case will exceed one), and (i) for 2026, equals the amount, if any, by which the 2026 Net Revenue exceeds $140.0 million, divided by $10.0 million (subject to adjustment for the exercise price of eligible options), and (ii) for 2027, equals the amount, if any, by which the 2027 Net Revenue exceeds $160.0 million, divided by $15.0 million (subject to adjustment for the exercise price of applicable Alimera Options).

In addition to the amounts payable to the holders thereof in connection with the Closing, all of the outstanding awards of restricted stock with respect to shares of Alimera Common Stock (each, an “Alimera RSA”), each Alimera Performance Stock Unit (“Alimera PSU”), each Alimera Restricted Stock Unit (“Alimera RSU”) and each Alimera Warrant that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time were automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive one (1) CVR per share of Alimera Common Stock then underlying the applicable instrument.
Each stock option previously granted by Alimera to purchase Alimera Common Stock (each, an “Alimera Option”) that was outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time and which had a per share exercise price that was less than the Closing Cash Consideration was, in addition to the amounts payable to the holders thereof in connection with the Closing, automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive one (1) CVR per share of Alimera Common Stock then underlying such Alimera Option. No other Alimera Options were cancelled and converted into the right to receive a CVR, provided that each Alimera Option with a per share exercise price greater than or equal to the Closing Cash Consideration but less than the Total Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) may receive a payment in connection with the payout of the CVRs (if any).
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company incurred approximately 
$12.4
 million in transaction costs related to the Merger Agreement, all of which were expensed. See Note 3 “Business Combination” to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the acquisition.
New Capital Structure
Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion of changes to our capital structure during 2024.
Restructuring 
On February 15, 2024, ANI Pharmaceuticals Canada, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with 1540700 Ontario Limited (“Buyer”) for the sale of ANI’s Oakville, Ontario former manufacturing site (the “Property”) for a total purchase price of 
$19.2
 million Canadian Dollars, or approximately 
$14.2 million
, based on the exchange rate at closing. During February 2024, and in accordance with the Agreement, the Buyer deposited a total of approximately $1.9 million Canadian Dollars, or approximately $1.4 million in refundable deposits in escrow as part of the total purchase price. 
On March 28, 2024 the Company completed the sale of the Property. After payment of commissions, taxes, and other related costs of approximately 
$0.7
 million, the Company received a net cash amount of approximately 
$13.5
 million at closing. The gain on the sale of the Property was approximately 
$5.3
 million, recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.

We derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of rare disease, brands portfolio of pharmaceutical products, generics, and other sources of revenue such as royalties on net sales of certain products, and other pharmaceutical services. Essentially all of our generic products face competition from other generic products, as do many of our brands products, and we expect them to continue to face competition from generic products in the future. The primary means of competition among generic manufacturers are pricing, contract terms, service levels, and reliability. Increased competition generally results in decreased average selling prices of generic and brands products over time. In addition, 
due to strategic partnerships between wholesalers and pharmacy chains, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increases in net sales to the wholesalers, with corresponding decreases in net sales to the pharmacy chains.
Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $614.4 million compared to $486.8 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of $127.6 million, or 26.2%, primarily as a result of the following:
•
Net revenues from Rare Disease and Brands, includes rare disease and brands portfolio of pharmaceutical products was $294.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $96.8 million, compared to $197.5 million, for the same period in 2023.

Net revenues for rare disease pharmaceutical products, include Cortrophin Gel and a full quarter contribution from ILUVIEN and YUTIQ, were $229.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $117.5 million from $112.1 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by increased volume in this third year of launch of Cortrophin Gel (product was launched in late January 2022) from overall ACTH market growth and share growth, and a full quarter of sales from ILUVIEN and YUTIQ, as a result of the acquisition of Alimera on September 16, 2024.

Net revenues for brands 
portfolio of 
pharmaceutical products were $64.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $20.6 million compared to $85.4 million for the same period in 2023, driven by a net decrease in volume. During portions of the prior year and the first quarter and portions of the fourth quarter of 2024, we were successful in supplying incremental volume in markets that were experiencing supply chain disruptions for competing products. This incremental volume was not a significant factor in the second and third quarter of 2024. Incremental volume achieved toward the end of 2024 continued into the first half of the first quarter of 2025. The timing, magnitude and persistence of such market share gains are inherently difficult to predict and they may not persist in future reporting periods.

hes. The Company launched a total of 17 new products in 2024.  From a product perspective, the increase was principally driven by revenues from year over year increases in products such as Baclofen OS, Candesartan, Colestipol, Estradiol, Ketoconazole, L-Glutamine, Pentoxyifylline, Pirfenidone, Prednisone, Vancomycin, among others.

Cost of sales consists of direct labor, including manufacturing and packaging, active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients, freight costs, packaging components, royalties payable related to profit-sharing arrangements, and amortization of the inventory fair value step-up recognized in connection with the acquisition of Alimera. Cost of sales does not include depreciation and amortization expense, which is reported as a separate component of operating expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, cost of sales increased to $250.2 million from $181.5 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of $68.7 million or 37.8%. The increase is primarily due to significant net growth in sales volumes of pharmaceutical products, significant growth of royalty bearing products, including Cortrophin Gel, and the amortization of the inventory step up related to the acquisition of Alimera of approximately $13.6 million.
Cost of sales, as a percentage of net revenues, increased from 
37.3%
 to 40.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a shift in product mix year over year, and increase in sales of products that bear a royalty payable.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, 12% of our raw material inventory purchases were from one domestic supplier. During the year ended December 31, 2023, no single vendor represented at least 10% of our raw material inventory purchases. During the year ended December 31,

•
R
esearch and development expenses increased from $34.3 million to $44.6 million, an increase of 30.0%, primarily due to a higher level of activity associated with ongoing and new projects, including expenses related to the New Day and Synchronicity clinical trials during the year ended December 31, 2024.
•
Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased from $161.7 million to $249.6 million, an increase of 54.4%, due to increased employment related costs, including incentive based compensation tied to record 2024 financial performance, investment in Rare Disease sales and marketing infrastructure and activities, legal expenses, transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisition of Alimera of approximately $18.2 million, severance expense of approximately $5.3 million and the settlement of all outstanding equity awards held by Alimera employees of approximately $9.2 million, and an overall increase in activities to support revenue growth in our Rare Disease and Brands segment.
•
Depreciation and amortization expense was $67.7 
million f
or the year ended 
December 31, 2024, compared to $59.8 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of approximately 
$7.9 million, 
primarily related to th
e amortization expense of the acquired intangible assets of ILUVIEN and YUTIQ of approximately $9.6 million. These assets were acquired on September 16, 2024 from Alimera.
•
We recognized a gain of 
$0.6 million and loss of $1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for the contingent consideration fair value adjustment. This financial statement line item consists of three components; the changes in fair value of (1) the Novitium contingent consideration; (2) the Alimera contingent value rights; and (3) the accrued Alimera licensor payments. 
•
We recorded a gain of approximately $0.6 million related to the the decrease in the expected future payments related to Novitium contingent consideration, and a decrease in fair value of $0.3 million related to the decrease in expected future payments of the accrued licensor payments. The gain was offset by a loss related to the increase in fair value of $0.3 million related to the Alimera contingent value rights.
•
We recognized restructuring activities expenses of 
$1.1

Interest expense, for the year ended December 31, 2024 consists primarily of coupon interest expense on borrowings under our outstanding debt and amortization of deferred financings costs on these debt instruments, interest income earned on our bank balances, and interest earned on our interest rate swap. During 2023 and for the first 8 months of 2024, only the Credit Facility with Truist was outstanding, however, in Q3 2024 we entered into a New Credit Facility and Convertible Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $641.3 million. The decrease in interest expense, net, of $9.3 million is primarily attributable to favorable interest rates on the New Credit Facility, Convertible Notes, and favorable bank interest rates during 2024.
•
Interest expense decreased approximately $2.0 million compared to prior year primarily due to the favorable interest rates on the New Credit Facility. Interest expense related to our debt during 2024 was $33.6 million, as compared to $35.6 million in the prior year.  
•
Interest income increased approximately $7.3 million compared to prior year, primarily due to interest and dividends earned on our bank balances and interest rate swap which increased to $16.0 million during 2024 from $8.7 million during 2023. 
•
Other expense, net, increased to approximately $4.0 million, primarily due to the fees paid to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Blackstone Credit & Insurance of $2.8 million pursuant to the terms of the debt commitment letter, dated June 21, 2024, entered into in connection with the acquisition of Alimera.
•
We recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $7.5 million, comprised of the write-off unamortized deferred financing fee
s related to the Credit Facility. 
On August 13, 2024, the Company entered into the 
2.25%

We are focused on expanding our business and product pipeline through collaborations, 
and also through acquisitions of products and companies. We are continually evaluating potential asset acquisitions and business combinations. To finance such acquisitions, we might raise additional equity capital, incur additional debt, or both.
Our working capital ratio, defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities, is 2.7 as of December 31, 2024
. We believe that our financial resources, consisting of net current working capital of approximately $334.0 million, anticipated future operating revenue and corresponding collections from customers, and our New Credit Agreement, under which $75.0 million remains available for borrowing as of December 31, 2024, 
will be sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital requirements, debt obligations, and other liability obligations for at least the next 12 months from the date of filing of this report, and for the foreseeable future thereafter. If our assumptions underlying estimated revenue and expenses are wrong, or if our cash requirements change materially as a result of shifts in our business or strategy, we could require additional financing. If we are not able to continue to be profitable in future years or are not able to continue to generate cash from operations as anticipated and additional capital is needed to support operations, we may be unable to obtain such financing, or obtain it on favorable terms, in which case we may be required to curtail development of new products, limit expansion of operations, or accept financing terms that are not as attractive as desired.
Consolidation among wholesale distributors, chain drug stores, and group purchasing organizations has resulted in a smaller number of companies each controlling a larger share of pharmaceutical distribution channels. Our net revenues were concentrated among four customers representing 25%, 16%, 12%, and 11% of net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024 accounts receivable from these four customers totaled approximately 70% of accounts receivable, net. Our net revenues were concentrated among four customers representing 31%, 13%, 13%, and 12% of net revenues during the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, accounts receivable from these four customers totaled approximately 
81%
 of accounts receivable, net. As a result, negotiated payment terms with these customers have a material impact on our liquidity and working capital.
Our Cortrophin Gel product accounted for approximately 32% and 23% of our net revenues in 2024 and 2023, respectively. We pay to Merck Sharpe & Dohme B.V. ("Merck") quarterly contingent consideration in the form of a perpetual, tiered royalty expressed as a percentage of Cortrophin Gel net sales. During the initial two years of commercialization (2022 and 2023) this royalty approximated 10% of net sales. During 2024, the blended Merck royalty rate was in the upper teens, and we currently anticipate the blended royalty rate to be in in the low 20 percent range in 2025.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Term Loan A 
On August 13, 2024, the Company, as lead borrower, entered into a delayed-draw credit agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and other financial institutions (together, the “Lenders”), which provides for aggregate principal commitments consisting of (i) a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 
$325.0 million
 (the “Term Loan A” or “TLA”), and (ii) a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate commitment amount of 
$75.0
 million, which may be used for revolving credit loans, swingline loans and letters of credit (the “TLA Revolver” and together with the TLA, the “New Credit Facility”).
The facilities are secured by a lien on substantially all of the personal property owned by the Company and its material wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and is guaranteed by all of the Company’s material wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The New Credit Facility matures on the date that is five years following the closing date of the New Credit Agreement, provided that if any of the Notes (defined below) remain outstanding on the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Notes, the New Credit Facility will mature on such date unless certain terms are met. 
At the Company’s option, loans under the New Credit Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to (i) the alternate base rate or (ii) the adjusted term SOFR rate for an interest period of one, three or six months, plus a spread depending on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio, between 1.25% and 2.00% in the case of ABR loans and between 2.25% and 3.00% in the case of adjusted term SOFR rate loans. A commitment fee accrues on the unutilized commitments under the TLA Revolver and, from and after the date that is two months after the closing date of the New Credit Agreement, the TLA at a per annum rate equal between 0.25% and 0.40% depending on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio.

The New Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations and warranties of the parties for credit facilities of this type, subject to customary exceptions and materiality standards. In addition, the Company is required to maintain a first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 3.00:1.00 (provided, that the lead borrower under the New Credit Agreement may elect to increase the ratio to 3.50:1.00 for four consecutive fiscal quarters following the consummation of a material acquisition) and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00.
The New Credit Agreement also contains certain customary covenants including but not limited to restrictions on the amount of debt the Company and its restricted subsidiaries may incur and payments the Company and its restricted subsidiaries may make, and events of default, as well as, in the event of an occurrence of an event of default, customary remedies for the Lenders, including the acceleration of any amounts outstanding under the New Credit Agreement. 
On September 16, 2024 (the “Closing Date”) the Company drew the full $325.0 million of Term Loan A principal on September 16, 2024, with proceeds used to finance the acquisition of Alimera, including fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction. As of December 31, 2024, the TLA Revolver remains undrawn, and $75.0 million is available for borrowing, subject to certain conditions. The TLA and the TLA Revolver mature on September 16, 2029. The New Credit Facility contains certain contingent acceleration clauses, none of which have been triggered as of December 31, 2024. The cash interest rate and effective rate under the Term Loan A was approximately 6.98% at December 31, 2024. 
2.25%
 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029
On August 07, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the initial purchasers (the “Initial Purchasers”) relating to the issuance of the $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company granted the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $41.25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes (the “Option”) for settlement at any time during the thirteen days beginning on, and including, August 7, 2024, which Option was exercised in full on August 8, 2024.
On August 13, 2024 (the “Closing Date” or “Issue Date”), the Company completed an offering of $316.25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the “Indenture”) dated as of August 13, 2024 between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (“Trustee”). The Notes are due September 1, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted. The Notes will accrue interest at a rate of 2.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2025. After deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions of approximately $9.5 million, but before deducting the Company’s offering expenses, the net proceeds to the Company from the offering of the Notes was approximately $306.8 million. After payment of the cost of entering into the Capped Call Transactions (as defined below), the Company used the remainder of the net proceeds from the Notes offering, together with cash on hand, to repay the Company’s existing senior secured credit agreement, dated as of November 19, 2021, by and among the Company, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, as guarantors, Truist Bank, as administrative agent and other parties thereto, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”).
The Notes are the Company’s senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with the Company’s existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company’s subsidiaries.

Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2029, holders of the Notes will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth in the Indenture. All or any portion of the Notes may be converted prior to June 1, 2029 at the holders’ option upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2024, if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price of the Notes for each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (ii) during the five consecutive business days immediately after any ten consecutive trading day period (such ten consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate of the Notes on such trading day; (iii) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on the Company's common stock, as described in the Indenture; or (iv) if the Company calls such Notes for redemption.
On or after June 1, 2029 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date of the Notes, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at any time at their election. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 13.4929 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $74.11 per share of the Company’s common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for holders that convert their Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, as described in the Indenture.
Upon conversion of the Notes, the Company will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company's conversion obligation.
Capped Call Transactions 
In connection with the offering of Notes, on August 7, 2024 and August 8, 2024, the Company entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (“Capped Calls”). The Capped Calls each have an initial strike price of 
$114.02
, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on August 7, 2024. The Company used approximately 
$40.6
 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to pay premiums on the Capped Calls. 
The Capped Calls are expected to generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reductions and/or offset subject to a cap, based on the cap price of the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments
, approximately 
4.3 million
 shares of the Company's common stock. 
The Capped Calls will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. The Capped Calls are separate transactions entered into by the Company with the financial institution counterparties thereto, the Capped Calls are not part of the terms of the Notes and the Capped Calls do not change the holders’ rights under the Notes. The Capped Calls do not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as they meet the criteria for equity classification, and the capped call transaction premiums are recorded as a reduction to Additional Paid-In Capital within Shareholders’ Equity, net of deferred income taxes.

Debt Extinguishment 
On November 19, 2021, the Company, as borrower, entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Truist Bank and other lenders, which provided for credit facilities consisting of (i) a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million (the “Term Facility”) and (ii) a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate commitment amount of $40.0 million, which may be used for revolving credit loans, swingline loans and letters of credit (the “Revolving Facility,” and together with the Term Facility, the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility was secured by substantially all our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries. On August 13, 2024, the Company entered into the 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029. The proceeds of the Convertible Senior Notes were used to repay the Credit Facility in its entirety, approximately $294.0 million, comprised of $292.5 million of unpaid principal, $1.2 million in accrued and unpaid interest, and $0.3 million of legal fees. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, amounting to approximately $7.5 million, comprised of the write-off unamortized deferred financing fees related to the Credit Facility as of August 13, 2024.
Accrued Licensor Payments
On May 17, 2023, Alimera entered into the Product Rights Agreement with EyePoint which granted Alimera an exclusive and sublicensable right and license under EyePoint’s and its affiliates’ interest in certain of EyePoint’s and its affiliates’ intellectual property to develop, manufacture, sell, commercialize and otherwise exploit certain products, including YUTIQ, for the treatment and prevention of uveitis in the entire world, except Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where the Company already has such rights pursuant to the New Collaboration Agreement, and except for China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Brunei, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, where Ocumension holds a license from EyePoint. Pursuant to the agreement, Alimera paid EyePoint an upfront payment of 
an upfront payment of $75.0 million and has also made four quarterly guaranteed payments to EyePoint totaling $7.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.

The Company will also pay royalties to EyePoint from 2025 to 2028 at a percentage of mid-to-low double digits of annual U.S. net sales of certain products (including YUTIQ and ILUVIEN) in excess of certain thresholds, beginning at $70.0 million in 2025, increasing annually thereafter. Upon making the quarterly payments in the aggregate amount of $7.5 million in 2024, the licenses and rights granted to the Company will automatically become perpetual and irrevocable. 
Equity Fin
ancing
In May
 2023, through a public offering, we completed the issuance and sale of 
2,183,545
 shares of ANI common stock, resulting in net proceeds after issuance costs of approximately 
$80.6 million, which was used to acquire and invest in additional businesses, technologies, products or assets, to fund our commercialization efforts, including, but not limited to, sales and marketing and consulting expenses related thereto, and for general corporate purposes. 
Uses of Cash
Our primary cash requirements are to fund operations of the rare disease portion of our Rare Disease and Brands segment, research and development programs and collaborations, to support general and administrative activities, to purchase equipment and machinery to expand our manufacturing capabilities as our product lines grow, and to expand our business and product pipeline through acquisitions of products and companies. We are continually evaluating potential asset acquisitions and business combinations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
product mix and pricing for product sales and contract manufacturing; 
•
pricing and payment terms with customers; 
•
costs of raw materials and payment terms with suppliers; 
•
capital expenditures and equipment purchases to support product launches; and 
•
business and product acquisitions.

Net Cash Provided by Operations
Net cash provided by operating activities was $64.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $119.0 million used in operating activities during the same period in 2023, a decrease of $54.9 million. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from our net loss of $18.5 million adjusted for non-cash items, and an increase in working capital driven by the growth of our business, resulting in incremental accounts receivable and inventory.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $404.7 million, principally due to the acquisition of Alimera of approximately $401.3 million and capital expenditures of approximately $16.2 million. These cash outflows were offset by proceeds received from the sale of Oakville, Ontario manufacturing site in March 2024 of approximately $13.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $18.5 million, principally due to $8.9 million of capital expenditures and the consideration paid for asset acquisitions of ANDAs and other product rights totaling $9.6 million.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $264.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, principally resulting from proceeds from the New Credit Facility of $325.0 million, proceeds from the offering of the Convertible Senior Notes of $316.3 million, tempered by the repayment of the Truist Credit Facility of $292.5 million, purchase of the capped calls of $40.6 million, payments of debt issuance costs related to the Convertible Senior Notes and New Credit Facility of $17.4 million, $12.5 million paid the the Company Members of Novitium, and $11.0 million of treasury stock purchase, and other items. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $67.4 million, principally due to the $80.6 million in net proceeds from the May 2023 public offering and $9.0 million from proceeds from stock option exercises and ESPP purchases. This was offset by cash used in financing activities related to $12.5 million to Company Members of Novitium, $3.0 million maturity payments on the Term Facility, $5.0 million of treasury stock purchased in relation to restricted stock vests, and $1.6 million convertible preferred stock dividends paid.

Contractual Obligations
We believe our available cash and cash equivalents along with our ability to generate operating cash flow and continued access to debt markets are sufficient to fund existing and planned cash requirements. Our contractual obligations and commitments as of 
December 31, 2024
 are comprised of principal payments on debt, interest payments on debt, operating leases, purchase obligations, dividends, and contingent consideration.
New Credit Agreement
Our largest contractual obligation relates to our principal payments on our interest payments on our debt. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the principal amount of our New Credit Agreement was approximately $323.0
 million
. 
At the Company’s option, loans under the New Credit Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to (i) the alternate base rate or (ii) the adjusted term SOFR rate for an interest period of one, three or six months, plus a spread depending on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio, between 1.25% and 2.00% in the case of ABR loans and between 2.25% and 3.00% in the case of adjusted term SOFR rate loans. A commitment fee accrues on the unutilized commitments under the TLA Revolver and, from and after the date that is two months after the closing date of the New Credit Agreement, the TLA at a per annum rate equal between 0.25% and 0.40% depending on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio.
 The cash interest rate under the Term Loan A was approximately 6.98% at December 31, 2024. See Note 6 "New Credit A
greement" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K 
for additional information and timing on our principal payments on debt. 
An interest rate swap is used to manage changes in SOFR-based variable interest rates underlying a portion of the borrowing under the New Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the swap agreement, ANI pays the counterparty an effective fixed rate of 2.313%. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the notional value of the interest rate swap was $139.4 million. See 
Note 8 "Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activity" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in 
Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
2.25% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029
On August 13, 2024, the Company completed an offering of $316.25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the “Indenture”) dated as of August 13, 2024 between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (“Trustee”). The Notes are due September 1, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted. The Notes will accrue interest at a rate of 2.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2025. 
See Note 7 "2.25% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information and timing on our principal payments on debt. 
Leases 
Our operating leases are primarily for warehouse, office space, and office equipment. As leases
 expire, we do not anticipate difficulty in negotiating renewals or finding other satisfactory space if the premise becomes unavailable. See Note 17 "Commitments and Contingencies" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion and timing of payments related to these operating lease obligations.
PIPE Shares
Our convertible preferred stock (“PIPE Shares”) accrue dividends at 6.50% per year on a cumulative basis, payable in cash or in-kind. Dividends are payable until the preferred stock is converted, either at the option of the PIPE investor, at any time, or the option of ANI, beginning two years after the November 19, 2021 issuance provided ANI’s stock price reaches a certain level. See Note 13 "Mezzanine and Stockholders’ Equity" in the notes to the con
solidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of dividends.

Novitium Contingent Consideration
Consideration of the Novitium acquisition included $46.5 million in contingent future earn-out payments. The contingent consideration is based on the achievement of certain milestones, including milestones on gross profit of Novitium portfolio products over a 24-month period, regulatory filings completed during this 24-month period, and a percentage of net profits on certain products that are launched in the future. Pursuant to the terms of the Novitium Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 8, 2021, on December 12, 2023, the Company paid $12.5 million of cash consideration to the Company Members, defined as the holders of Novitium ownership interests in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, of Novitium for the achievement of the "ANDA Filing Earn-Out," as defined in the Agreement
. On February 22, 2024, the Company paid $12.5 million to Novitium related to the achievement of the milestone. See Note 12 "Fair Value" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item
 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our contingent consideration.
Alimera Contingent Value Rights
In connection with the acquisition of Alimera, purchase consideration included $8.7 million in contingent value rights which provided for future contingent payments, based on the achievement of Net Revenue milestones in 2026 and 2027. 
The fair value of the contingent value rights as of December 31, 2024 was approximately 
$9.0 million

Accrued Licensor Payments 
The Company will also pay royalties to EyePoint from 2025 to 2028 at a percentage of mid-to-low double digits of annual U.S. net sales of certain products (including YUTIQ and ILUVIEN) in excess of certain thresholds, beginning at $70.0 million in 2025, increasing annually thereafter. Upon making the quarterly payments in the aggregate amount of $7.5 million in 2024, the licenses and rights granted to the Company will automatically become perpetual and irrevocable. The present value of the remaining payments to EyePoint for years 2025 to 2028 will continue to be revalued at an appropriate discount rate for the Company at each reporting date until they are settled. The fair value of the remaining future payments as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $21.0 million.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, "Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and assumptions, including those described below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the estimation processes involved, the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding our business operations, financial condition, and operating results.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are primarily derived from sales of generic, rare disease, and brands 
portfolio of 
pharmaceutical products, royalties, and other pharmaceutical services. Revenue is recognized when our obligations under the terms of our contracts with customers are satisfied, which generally occurs when control of the products we sell is transferred to the customer. 
81

 of Contents
Variable consideration is estimated after the consideration of applicable information that is reasonably available. The Company generally does not have incremental costs to obtain contracts that would otherwise not have been incurred. 
The Company does not adjust revenue for the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component because our customers generally pay us within 100 days.
The Company's gross product revenue is subject to a variety of deductions, which are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenue is recognized, and primarily represent chargebacks, rebates, prompt payment (cash) discounts, Medicaid and other government pricing programs, price protection and shelf stock adjustments, sales returns, and other potential adjustments. Those deductions represent estimates of rebates and discounts related to gross sales for the reporting period and, as such, knowledge and judgment of market conditions and practice are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.
Historically, the Company's changes of estimates reflecting actual results or updated expectations have not been material to our overall business. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate predictors of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program, type of customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated with governmental allowances, Medicaid and other performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual and its ultimate settlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Because of this time lag, in any given quarter, our adjustments to actual can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters.
Chargebacks
If actual results were not consistent with our estimates, the Company could be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, as changes to chargeback estimates could cause an increase or decrease in revenue recognized during the year and increase or decrease accounts receivable. If there were a 1% change in the chargeback estimates throughout the year, our net revenues would be affecte
d by $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Government Rebates
If actual results were not consistent with our estimates as related to government rebates, the Company could be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, as changes to government rebate estimates could cause an increase or decrease in revenue recognized during the year and decrease or increase the government rebate reserve. If there were a 10% change in the government rebate estimates throughout the year, our net revenues would be affected by $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Returns
If actual results were not consistent with our estimates, the Company could be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, as changes to returns estimates could cause an increase or decrease in revenue recognized during the year and decrease or increase the returned goods reserve. If there were a 10% change in the returns estimates throughout the year, our net revenues would be affected by $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Administrative Fees and Other Rebates
If actual results were not consistent with our estimates, the Company could be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, as changes to these estimates could cause an increase or decrease in revenue recognized during the year and increase or decrease accounts receivable. If there were a 10% change in the administrative fees estimates throughout the year, our net revenues would be affected by $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Prompt Payment Discounts
If customers do not take 100% of available discounts as we estimate, the Company could need to re-adjust our methodology for calculating the prompt payment discount reserve. If there were a 10% decrease in the prompt payment discounts estimates throughout the year, our net revenues would increase by $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill
The Company allocates goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. The Company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (October 31) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. 
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. 
The carrying value of goodwill at December 31, 2024 was approximately 
$60.0
 million. As part of the Novitium acquisition on November 19, 2021, we acquired goodwill of $24.6 million in the Generics and Other reporting unit. 
As a result of the acquisition of Alimera, on September 16, 2024, the Company recorded goodwill of $31.8 million in the Rare Disease reporting unit. The Company
 believes it is unlikely that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to test for impairment losses on goodwill. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we could be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.
Impairments of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company evaluates assets for potential impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and fair value which is generally an expected present value cash flow technique. The Company's policy in determining whether an impairment indicator exists comprises measurable operating performance criteria as well as other qualitative measures. Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a product in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. If the Company's assumptions are not correct, there could be an impairment loss in subsequent periods or, in the case of a change in the estimated useful life of the asset, a change in amortization expense.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives, including IPR&D, are tested for impairment if impairment indicators arise and, at a minimum, annually. However, an entity is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. Further testing is only required if the entity determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. Otherwise, no further impairment testing is required. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test consists of a one-step analysis that compares the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We consider many factors in evaluating whether the value of its intangible assets with indefinite lives may not be recoverable, including, but not limited to the discount rate, terminal growth rates, general economic conditions, our outlook and market 
performance of our industry and recent and forecasted financial performance. We recognized an impairment loss of $4.0 million during the three months ended December 31, 2024 related to IPR&D which was acquired as part of the Novitium acquisition during 2021, and also recorded an impairment loss of $3.6 million on a basket of definite-lived intangible assets.

Contingent Consideration
Accrued Licensor Payments 
The terms of the Product Rights Agreement between the Company and EyePoint include the potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement o
f annual U.S. net sales of certain products (including YUTIQ and ILUVIEN) in excess of certain thresholds, beginning at $70.0 million in 2025, increasing annually thereafter. The fair value of the Accrued Licensor Payments was approximately 
$21.0 million
 at December 31, 2024. 
Significant inputs used in the measurement of the fair value include discount rates and probabilities of achievement of net revenue. Changes in fair value, which incorporate changes in assumptions and the passage of time, are recognized as an operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Novitium Contingent Consideration
The fair value of the Novitium contingent consideration was 
$10.9 million
 and 
$24.0 million
 at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured to the estimated fair value each reporting period with the change recognized as an operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Changes in fair value can result from changes in assumptions such as discount rates, probabilities or estimates of revenue and profits, and probability of achieving regulatory milestones, as well as the passage of time. These changes resulted in a decrease of the fair value of the liability of approximately 
$0.6
 million and an increase of the fair value of the liability of 
$1.4
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Alimera Contingent Value Rights 
The fair value of the Alimera Contingent Value Rights c
onsideration was $9.0 million at December 31, 2024. The fair value of Alimera Contingent Value Rights is remeasured to the estimated fair value each reporting period with the change recognized as an operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Changes
 in fair value can result from 
changes in assumptions such as discount rates, probabilities or estimates of future revenue and profits, as well as the passage of time. These changes resulted in charges of $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation c
ost for stock options is determined at the grant date using an option pricing model and stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock is based on the closing market price of the stock at the grant date. The value of the award is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the employee’s requisite service period. Awards may also be issued in the form of Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”) to certain employees of the Company. PSUs represent the right to receive an amount of cash, a number of shares of common stock or a combination of both, contingent upon the achievement of specified performance and market objectives during a specified performance period. The related share-based compensation expense is determined based on the estimated fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant and is recognized straight-line over the vesting term.
Valuation of stock awards requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of the awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price and dividend yields. Changes in these assumptions can affect the fair value estimate.
The following table summarizes stock-based compensation and ESPP expense included in our consolidated statements of operations:

These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price and dividend yields. Changes in these assumptions can affect the fair value estimate.
Changes in estimates could affect compensation expense within individual periods. If there were to be a 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense for the year, our (Loss) Income Before (Benefit) Expense for Income Taxes would be affected by $2.9 million
 for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted.
The Company uses a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company has not identified any uncertain income tax positions that could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company is subject to taxation in various U.S. jurisdictions, Canada, India, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal, and Germany and all of its income tax returns remain subject to examination by tax authorities due to the availability of net operating loss carryforwards. To the extent the Company is required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
The Company considers potential tax effects resulting from discontinued operations and gains and losses included in 
other comprehensive (loss) income 
and record intra-period tax allocations, when those effects are deemed material. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, our level of earnings, and the results of tax audits.
Although the Company believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
Legal and Other Contingencies 
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market risks include interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, and other relevant market rate or price risks. Of these risks, interest rate risk, equity risk, and foreign currency exchange rate risk could have a significant impact on our results of operations.
Interest Rate Risk
On August 13, 2024, the Company entered into a New Credit Agreement, which is secured by substantially all of the personal property and certain material real property owned by ANI and our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, and obligations under the New Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The Term Loan A proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of Alimera, including fees, costs, and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition. Proceeds from the TLA Revolver are expected to be used, subject to certain limitations, for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
 As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $323.0 million of debt outstanding under our New Credit Agreement, bearing interest at variable rates, tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Accordingly, our earnings and cash flows will be affected by changes in interest rates to the extent the principal balance is unhedged. Assuming no change in the amount of debt outstanding, a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate under these borrowings would have increased the interest expense related to our variable rate debt by approximately 
$1.8 million
 based upon our unhedged portion of principal debt outstanding as of December 31, 2024. Actual results may vary due to changes in the amount of variable rate debt outstanding.
A commitment fee accrues on the unutilized commitments under the TLA Revolver and, from and after the date that is two months after the closing date of the New Credit Agreement, the TLA at a per annum rate equal between 0.25% and 0.40% depending on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio.
The returns from certain of our cash and cash equivalents will vary as short-term interest rates change. A 100 basis-point adverse movement (decrease) in short-term interest rates would decrease the interest income earned on our cash balance in the year ended December 31, 2024 by approximately $1.4 million.
Foreign Currency Risk
In connection with our recent acquisition of Alimera, we have increased our international operations, exposing us to increased risk of foreign currency exchange fluctuations as compared to prior periods. In particular, we are now exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in British Pounds and Euros in addition to the Indian rupee. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively impact our revenue, income, assets, liabilities, and equity. We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis. Currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our revenue, income, assets, liabilities, or equity during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Equity Investment Risk
Our equity investment is held in the marketable equity security of one publicly traded company (CG Oncology, Inc.). As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our marketable equity security was approximately $6.3 million. This security is subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holding. A decline in financial condition or operating results of this investment could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our carrying value in this company.

Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), mezzanine equity and stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
Evaluation of the Chargeback Accrual
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records variable consideration estimated at the time of sale, for chargebacks. The amount accrued for chargebacks as of December 31, 2024, is approximately $105.6 million. Management’s estimate of the chargeback accrual is based on inventory levels in the distribution channel of wholesalers, impacted by the actual average selling price for each product and the wholesaler acquisition cost, utilized to estimate the expected chargeback provision and accrual.
We identified the chargeback accrual as a critical audit matter as there is especially challenging auditor judgment required with respect to the calculation of the chargeback accrual given certain assumptions used including purchasing trends of distributors and historical product sales used to predict future sales.

Ta

e
 of Contents
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included assessing the design and testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the chargeback accrual, including management’s control over the assumptions used to estimate the accrual. We evaluated the inventory levels in the distribution channel of wholesalers and considered the underlying contracts for the actual average selling price. We also validated the wholesaler acquisition costs for a selection of products. We evaluated the accrual for chargebacks by comparing historically recorded accruals to the actual amount that was ultimately claimed by the wholesalers. We analyzed year over year trends in the accrual in comparison with revenue trends to further evaluate reasonableness of the estimate and consistency with expectations.
Acquisition of Alimera – Valuation of Intangible Assets
As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired Alimera Sciences, Inc. (“Alimera”) on September 16,2024 and the transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The acquisition of Alimera was complex due to the significant estimates required by management to determine the fair value of identified intangible assets of $400.0 million. The determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired required management, to utilize the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist and to make significant estimates and assumptions including the estimated net revenue growth rate, gross profit margin, economic life and discount rate.
We identified the valuation of intangible assets resulting from the Alimera acquisition as a critical audit matter given the especially challenging auditor judgment required in evaluating the inputs and assumptions used in determining fair value off the intangible assets. The key assumptions include discount rates, projected revenues and gross profit margins. Changes in these significant assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the intangible assets.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included assessing the design and testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the third-party valuation report which included management’s review of the third-party valuation report for the completeness and mathematical accuracy of the data, and evaluating the reasonableness of assumptions used in the calculation such as economic life and discount rate. We utilized a valuation specialist to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the Company’s valuation models developed for acquired intangible assets and evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used including the estimated net revenue growth rate, gross margin percentages, economic life and discount rate as compared to industry and market data. We also examined the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates used in the third-party valuation report, including historical and projected financial information.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
We have audited ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Alimera Sciences, Inc. (“Alimera”), which was acquired on September 16, 2024, and whose financial statements represent approximately 5% of the Company’s consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 and assets associated with Alimera’s operations represent approximately 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets as of December 31, 2024. Accordingly, our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Alimera.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), mezzanine equity and stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024 and the related notes and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
An entity’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. An entity’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
89

 of Contents
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
1. 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Business
ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (together, “ANI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a diversified bio-pharmaceutical company. The Company's mission is “Serving Patients, Improving Lives” by developing, manufacturing, and commercializing high-quality therapeutics.
On September 16, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Alimera Sciences, Inc. ("Alimera"), a Delaware corporation, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of June 21, 2024, by and among the Company, Alimera and ANIP Merger Sub INC., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Alimera, with Alimera surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the acquisition, the Company added two new products, ILUVIEN® and YUTIQ®, both of which are indicated for the treatment of chronic retinal diseases. See Note 3 "Business Combination" in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the acquisition.
The Company owns and operates 
three
 pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, of which two are located in Baudette, Minnesota, and one is located in East Windsor, New Jersey, are together capable of producing oral solid dose products, as well as semi-solids, liquids and topicals, controlled substances, and potent products that must be manufactured in a fully-contained environment. The Company has ceased operations at the Oakville, Ontario, manufacturing facility as of March 31, 2023. This action was part of ongoing initiatives to capture operational synergies following the acquisition of Novitium Pharma LLC (“Novitium”) in November 2021. The Company has fully completed the transition of the products manufactured or packaged at Oakville to one of the 
three
 U.S.-based manufacturing sites. In February 2024, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale of the Oakville site, for a price of $
19.2
 million Canadian Dollars, or approximately $
14.2
 million, based on the exchange rate at closing of such transaction. The sale closed on March 28, 2024 (Note 4).
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”).
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Foreign Currency
The Company currently has subsidiaries located in India, Ireland, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The India-based subsidiary generally conducts its transactions in Indian Rupees, which is also its functional currency. The Ireland and Germany locations generally conduct their transactions in Euros, which is also their functional currency. The United Kingdom subsidiary conducts its transactions in Euros and British Pounds, and their functional currency is Euros. The Company has ceased operations at its subsidiary in Oakville, Ontario, Canada as of March 31, 2023. The Canada-based subsidiary conducted its transactions in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars, but its functional currency was the U.S. dollar.

ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
The results of any non-U.S. dollar transactions and balances are remeasured in U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates during the period and resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net (loss) income. The gain or loss on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the translation impact of local currencies to U.S. dollars was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. Unless otherwise noted, all references to “$” or “dollar” refer to the U.S. dollar. The Company’s asset and liability accounts are translated using the current exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, except for shareholders’ equity accounts, which are translated using historical rates. Net revenues and expense accounts are translated using an average exchange rate over the period ended on the balance sheet date. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In the consolidated financial statements, estimates are used for, but not limited to, variable consideration determined based on accruals for chargebacks, administrative fees and rebates, government rebates, returns and other allowances, income tax provision or benefit, deferred taxes and valuation allowance, stock-based compensation, revenue recognition, allowance for inventory obsolescence, valuation of financial instruments and intangible assets, accruals for contingent liabilities, including contingent consideration and contingent value rights in acquisitions, fair value of long-lived assets, determination of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, allowance for credit losses, and the depreciable lives of long-lived assets. Because of the uncertainties inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from those estimates. Management periodically evaluates estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness.
Business Combination and Goodwill
The Company accounted for its acquisition of Alimera using the acquisition method of accounting prescribed by ASC 805,
 Business Combinations
, whereby the results of operations, including the revenues and earnings of Alimera, are included in the financial statements from the date of acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition are recognized at their fair values based on widely accepted valuation techniques in accordance with ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements
. Goodwill is recognized for the excess of the consideration transferred over the net fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Management’s assessment of qualitative factors affecting goodwill for each acquisition includes estimates of market share at the date of purchase, ability to grow in the market, synergy with existing Company operations and the payor profile in the markets. The fair value assigned to the intangible assets was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings methodology. The process for estimating fair values requires the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgments, including determining the timing and estimates of future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. The estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable using the best information available. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ materially from estimates.
ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
, establishes a measurement period to provide the Company with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure various items in a business combination and cannot extend beyond one year from the acquisition date. Measurement period adjustments are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined and calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of acquisition date. The Company expects to complete the final fair value determination of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as soon as practicable within the measurement period, but not to exceed one year from the acquisition date.
Investment in Equity Securities 
The Company accounts for its investment in equity securities with a readily determinable fair value in accordance with the guidance in ASC 321, 
Investments – Equity Securities
. The Company presents unrealized gains and losses related to the equity securities, within Unrealized gain on investment in equity securities in its consolidated statements of operations. Fair values are obtained from quoted prices on the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. (“NASDAQ”).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
Restructuring Activities
The Company defines restructuring activities to include costs directly associated with exit or disposal activities. Such costs include cash employee contractual severance and other termination benefits, one-time employee termination severance and benefits, contract termination charges, impairment and acceleration of depreciation associated with long-lived assets, and other exit or disposal costs. In general, the Company records involuntary employee- related exit and disposal costs when there is a substantive plan for employee severance and related payments are probable and estimable. For one-time termination benefits, including those with a service requirement, expense is recorded when the employees are entitled to receive such benefits and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Expense related to one-time termination benefits with a service requirement is recorded over time, as the service is completed. Contract termination fees and penalties, and other exit and disposal costs are generally recorded as incurred. Restructuring activities are recognized as an operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. Revenue is recognized using the following steps:
•
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•
Determination of the transaction price, including the identification and estimation of variable consideration;
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•
Recognition of revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company derives its revenues primarily from sales of generic, rare disease, and brands 
portfolio 
pharmaceutical products, royalties, and other pharmaceutical services. Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of contracts with customers are satisfied, which generally occurs when control of the products sold is transferred to the customer. Generally, the Company does not incur incremental costs to obtain contracts that would otherwise not have been incurred. The Company has not identified any agreements or arrangement that would qualify as a significant financing component.
Sales of pharmaceutical products are subject to variable consideration due to chargebacks, government rebates, returns, administrative and other rebates, and cash discounts. Estimates for these elements of variable consideration require significant judgment. 
Revenue from Distribution Agreements
From time to time, the Company may enter into marketing and distribution agreements with third parties in which products are sold under Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”) or New Drug Applications (“NDAs”) owned or licensed by third parties. These products are sold under the ANI label. The Company controls the products sold under these marketing and distribution agreements and therefore are the principal for sales under each of these marketing and distribution agreements. As a result, revenue is recognized on a gross basis when control has passed to the customer and the performance obligation has been satisfied. Under these agreements, the Company pays third parties a specified percentage of the gross profit earned on sales of the products. These profit-sharing percentages are recognized in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations and are accrued in accrued royalties in the consolidated balance sheets until payment has occurred.

ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
Contract Manufacturing Product Sales Revenue
Contract manufacturing arrangements consist of agreements in which pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the Company on behalf of a third party. The performance obligation is to manufacture and provide pharmaceutical products to customers, typically pharmaceutical companies. The products are sold at predetermined standalone selling prices and the performance obligation is considered to be satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Control is transferred to the customer when the product leaves the shipping dock to be shipped to the customer, as contract manufactured pharmaceutical products are sold on an FOB shipping point basis and the inventory risk and risk of ownership passes to the customer at that time. Payment terms for these sales are generally fewer than two months. Typically, there are no material returns for contract manufactured products.
Royalties from Licensing Agreements
From time to time, the Company enters into licensing agreements, under which the Company licenses to the seller the right to sell the acquired products. Because these royalties are sales-based, the Company recognizes the revenue when the underlying sales occur, based on sales and gross profit information received from the sellers. The Company may enter into agreements which include profit-sharing percentages on gross profits. The profit-sharing percentages are recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations when the associated revenue is recognized and are recorded in accrued royalties in the consolidated balance sheets when the associated revenue is recognized and until payment has occurred.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash deposited in checking accounts, time deposits with original maturities of less than three months, and money market accounts with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on-hand and money market funds which invest exclusively in high-quality, short-term securities that are issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Due to the short-term maturity of the funds invested in the money market accounts, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value. The majority of the Company's cash balances are held in interest bearing and non-interest bearing accounts in U.S.-based financial institutions which are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $
250
 thousand. The majority of the Company's cash balances are in excess of FDIC coverage, which the Company considers to be a normal business risk. In addition, the Company has cash and cash equivalents held in international bank accounts that are denominated in various foreign currencies, specifically in the UK, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, and India.
Accounts Receivable
The Company extends credit to customers on an unsecured basis. Expected credit losses are measured at amortized cost, including trade and unbilled receivables, on a collective basis, based on their similar risk characteristics. Expected credit losses are based on historical credit loss experience, review of the current aging or status of accounts receivable and current and forward-looking views from an economic and industry perspective. Receivables are written off when it is determined that amounts are uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses was immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Inventories
Inventories consist of raw materials, packaging materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value. The Company periodically reviews and adjusts standard costs, which generally approximate weighted average cost.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. 
Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives as follows:
Classification
Years
Buildings and improvements
20
-
40
years
Leasehold improvements 
Shorter of asset's useful life or remaining life of lease 
Machinery, furniture, and equipment
3
-
10
years
Construction in progress consists of multiple projects, primarily related to new equipment and expansion of laboratory and manufacturing facilities to expand manufacturing capability as product lines grow. Construction in progress includes the cost of construction and other direct costs attributable to the construction, along with capitalized interest. Depreciation is not recorded on construction in progress until such time as the assets are placed in service.
The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the long-lived asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets.

No
 impairment loss related to property and equipment was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. 
Assets Held-for-Sale 
The Company classifies assets held-for-sale if all held-for-sale criteria is met pursuant to ASC 360-10, 
Property, Plant and Equipment
. Criteria include management commitment to sell the disposal group in its present condition and the sale being deemed probable of being completed within one year. Assets classified as held-for-sale are not depreciated and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The Company assesses the fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, each reporting period it remains classified as held-for-sale and reports any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the initial carrying value of the disposal group. The Company determined that the Oakville, Ontario, Canada property met the held-for-sale criteria.
 As of December 31, 2023, approximately $
8.0
 million of assets held for sale were recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. S
ee Note 4 "Restructuring Canada Operations" in the notes to the con
solidated financial statements for additional information. 
Leases
Operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, and the Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts. There are no material residual guarantees associated with any of the Company’s leases, and there are no significant restrictions or covenants included in the Company’s lease agreements. Operating lease ROU assets are included in other non-current assets and operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had finance leases that consist of leases for automobiles. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized based on their pattern of economic benefit over their estimated useful lives, or the straight-line amortization method if not materially different, and reviewed periodically for impairment. The definite-lived ANDAs, NDAs and product rights, marketing and distribution rights, customer relationships, and non-compete agreement are stated at cost, net of amortization, and generally amortized over their remaining estimated useful lives, ranging from 
seven
 to 
twelve years
, based on the straight-line amortization method. In the case of certain NDA and product rights, an accelerated amortization method is used to better match the anticipated economic benefits expected to be provided. Management reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, in a manner similar to that for property and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2024, $
3.6
 million of 
impairment charges
 were recognized on intangible assets. During the year ended  December 31, 2023, 
no
 impairment charges were recognized on intangible assets.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $
0.1
 million related to a definite-lived ANDA intangible asset.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill include in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) projects. IPR&D intangible assets represent the fair value of technology acquired in a business combination for which the technology projects are incomplete but have substance. When an IPR&D project is completed (generally upon receipt of regulatory approval), the asset is then accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset. Indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might not be recoverable. Judgment is used in determining when these events and circumstances arise. During the year ended December 31, 2024, $
4.0
 million of 
impairment charges
 were recognized on indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. During the year ended  December 31, 2023, 
no
 impairment charges were recognized on indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, is carried at cost, using the purchase method of accounting, and is related to past business combinations with BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc., WellSpring, Novitium, and Alimera. The Company is organized in 
three
 reporting units, Generics and Other, Brands, and Rare Disease. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to periodic review for impairment. All of the Company's goodwill is recorded in the Generics and Other reporting unit, except for goodwill recorded as a result of the Alimera acquisition, which is recorded in the Rare Disease reporting unit.
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually, on October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. Under the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, the Company has the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test is performed. The goodwill impairment test requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, then no impairment is recognized. If the carrying amount recorded exceeds the fair value calculated, then an impairment charge is recognized for the difference. The judgments made in determining the projected cash flows used to estimate the fair value can materially impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. 
The Company assessed the assets qualitatively, and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units are greater than their carrying value as of October 31, 2024 and 2023, and therefore no quantitative testing for impairment was required.

No
 impairment loss related to goodwill was recognized in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Collaborative Arrangements 
The Company may enter into collaborative arrangements with various commercial partners to further business opportunities. In collaborative arrangements revenues and costs generated by collaborative arrangements may be presented on a gross or net basis depending on the specific facts of the collaborative arrangement.

Research and Development Expenses
Research and development ("R&D") activities are expensed as incurred. R&D expenses primarily consist of direct and allocated expenses incurred with the process of formulation, clinical research, and validation associated with new product development.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company issues stock options and restricted stock awards, which are awarded in exchange for employee and non-employee director services. From time to time, the Company may grant awards through an inducement grant outside of the incentive plan to induce prospective employees to accept employment with the Company. These grants are made pursuant to inducement grants outside of the shareholder approved equity plan as permitted under the Nasdaq Stock Market listing rules. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options is determined at the grant date using an option pricing model and stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock awards is based on the closing market price of the stock at the grant date. The value of the award is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the employee’s requisite service period and classified where the underlying salaries are classified. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. Excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies are recognized as a component of the current period provision for income taxes.  
Awards may also be issued in the form of Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”) to certain employees of the Company. PSUs represent the right to receive a number of shares of Company common stock, contingent upon the achievement of specified performance objectives during a specified performance period. PSUs granted vest over a 
three-year
 performance period. Currently, the PSU’s vesting is contingent upon the Company meeting certain total shareholder return (“TSR”) levels as compared to a select peer group over the over 
three years
, and contingent upon the Company meeting certain adjusted non-GAAP year-on-year 
earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”)
 growth rates over the vesting term. The related share-based compensation expense is determined based on the estimated fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant and is recognized straight-line over the vesting term.
The Company also administers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The estimated fair value of stock-based compensation awards are recognized and classified in the expense where the underlying salaries are classified. 
Valuation of stock awards requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of the awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of the Company's stock price and dividend yields. Changes in these assumptions can affect the fair value estimate.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted. The measurement of a deferred tax asset is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
The Company is subject to taxation in various U.S. jurisdictions, Canada, Europe, and India, and all of our income tax returns remain subject to examination by tax authorities due to the availability of net operating loss carryforwards.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
The Company uses a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company has not identified any uncertain income tax positions that could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax exposures as a component of income tax expense.
Derivative Instruments and Hedge Accounting
The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to interest rate risk, as well as benefit from favorable conditions. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value. For all of the Company’s derivative positions that are designated and qualify as part of a cash flow hedging relationship, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivatives is reported as a component of 
other comprehensive (loss) income 
and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. Gains and losses on derivatives representing any ineffective component of the hedge are recognized in current earnings. All of the Company’s cash flow hedges have been deemed effective as of December 31, 2024 and 2023

for both accounting and tax purposes. The Company has elected hedge accounting for both U.S. GAAP and tax purposes. The Company maintains formal documentation through a periodic memo and accounting analysis that cover what is being hedged, how it is being hedged, hedge effectiveness, the nature of the risk being hedged, among other required analyses. Company policy further includes a quarterly probability analysis covering hedge effectiveness.
Contingent Consideration
The terms of the acquisition agreement between ANI and Novitium Pharma LLC include the potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain regulatory and financial performance milestones. At the acquisition date, contingent consideration is recorded at fair value based on the additional consideration expected to be transferred, which is based on the estimate of probability-weighted future cash flows as discounted to present value. Significant inputs used in the measurement of the fair value include discount rates, probabilities of achievement of regulatory-based milestones and payments, and projected revenues and gross profits. The discount rates are derived using accepted valuation methodologies. The probability of achievement of regulatory milestones is based on historical and projected success rates. The projected revenues and gross profits are based on internal forecasts and long-term plans. The contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs. Changes in fair value, which incorporate changes in assumptions and the passage of time, are recognized as an operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. As payments are not expected to be made shortly after the acquisition, any future payment of contingent consideration will be reported as a financing cash flow for amounts paid up to the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration, and as an operating cash outflow for any amounts in excess of the acquisition-date fair value in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Accrued Licensor Payments 
The terms of an agreement between the Company and 
EyePoint Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“EyePoint”)
 include the potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement o
f annual U.S. net sales of certain products (including YUTIQ and ILUVIEN) in excess of certain thresholds, beginning at $
70.0
 million in 2025, increasing annually thereafter. 
Significant inputs used in the measurement of the fair value include discount rates and probabilities of achievement of net revenue. The discount rates are derived using accepted valuation methodologies. 
T
he projected net sales are based on internal forecasts and long-term plans. The contingent payments are remeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs. Changes in fair value, which incorporate changes in assumptions and the passage of time, are recognized as an operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Contingent Value Rights
In connection with the acquisition of Alimera, the Company issued Contingent Value Rights ("CVRs"), which provided for the holders to receive future contingent milestone cash payments based on certain net revenue thresholds established for 2026 and 2027. See Note 12 "Fair Value" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to CVR obligations. The contingent value rights are remeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs. Changes in fair value, which incorporate changes in assumptions and the passage of time, are recognized as an operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no amounts due and payable during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Fair Value Measurements 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability assuming an orderly transaction in the most advantageous market at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include:
•
Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.
•
Level 2—Observable market-based inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 3—Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.
The consolidated balance sheets include certain financial instruments (primarily cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities)
 that are carried at cost and that approximate fair values as of December 31, 2024, 2023 due to their short term nature. 
See Note 12 "Fair Value" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, which includes guidance to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. These amendments are effective for all public entities for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. These amendments apply on a prospective basis, but entities have an option to apply it retrospectively for all periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures and will adopt in the 2025 annual report on Form 10-K.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,
 Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (DISE)
, which specifies additional disclosure requirements. The new guidance requires additional disclosures, including the composition of certain income expense line items (such as purchases of inventory, employee compensation, and "other expenses") and a separate disclosure for selling expenses. This change is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, however, early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2024-03 will have on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures and anticipate adoption in the 2027 annual report on Form 10-K.

REVENUE RECOGNITION AND RELATED ALLOWANCES 
 Revenue Recognition
Revenues are primarily derived from sales of generic, rare disease, and brands portfolio pharmaceutical products, royalties, and other pharmaceutical services. Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of contracts with customers are satisfied, which generally occurs when control of the products is transferred to the customer. Variable consideration is estimated after the consideration of applicable information that is reasonably available. The Company generally does not have incremental costs to obtain contracts that would otherwise not have been incurred. The Company does not adjust revenue for the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component because our customers generally pay us within 100 days.
All revenue recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations is considered to be revenue from contracts with customers. The following table depicts the disaggregation of revenue:

ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
The Company recognized a decrease of 
$
3.0
 million of net revenue from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods during the year ended December 31, 2024, 
consisting primarily of

revised estimates for variable consideration, including chargebacks, rebates, returns, and other allowances, related to prior period sales. 
As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations for all open contract manufacturing customer contracts was 
$
0.7
 million, which consists of firm orders for contract manufactured products. ANI will recognize revenue for these performance obligations as they are satisfied, which is anticipated within 
six months
.
Variable Consideration
Sales of pharmaceutical products are subject to variable consideration due to chargebacks, government rebates, returns, administrative and other rebates, and cash discounts. Estimates for these elements of variable consideration require significant judgment.
Chargebacks
Chargebacks, primarily from wholesalers, result from arrangements with indirect customers establishing prices for products which the indirect customer purchases through a wholesaler. Alternatively, the Company may pre-authorize wholesalers to offer specified contract pricing to other indirect customers. Under either arrangement, the Company provides a chargeback credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler’s invoice price, typically Wholesale Acquisition Cost (“WAC”).
Prior period chargebacks claimed by wholesalers are analyzed to determine the actual average selling price (“ASP”) for each product. This calculation is performed by product by wholesaler. ASPs can be affected by several factors such as:
•
A change in customer mix
•
A change in negotiated terms with customers
•
A change in the volume of off-contract purchases
•
Changes in WAC
As necessary, ASPs are adjusted based on anticipated changes in the factors above.
The difference between ASP and WAC is recorded as a reduction in both gross revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets, at the time revenue is recognized from the product sale. The Company continually monitors chargeback activity and adjusts ASPs when the Company believes that actual selling prices will differ from current ASPs.
Government Rebates
Government rebates reserve consists of estimated payments due to governmental agencies for utilization of our products by beneficiaries under such governmental programs. The two largest government programs are Medicaid and Medicare.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
The Company participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and pays rebates to the states related on Medicaid beneficiary utilization of the Company's products. Medicaid rebates are billed within 60-90 days of the end of the quarter in which the product was dispensed to a Medicaid beneficiary. Medicaid rebate amounts per product unit are established by law, based on the Average Manufacturer Price (“AMP”), which is reported on a monthly and quarterly basis, and, in the case of branded products, best price, which is reported on a quarterly basis. Medicaid reserves are based on expected claims from state Medicaid programs. Estimates for expected claims are driven by patient usage, sales mix, calculated AMP or best price, as well as inventory in the distribution channel that will be subject to a Medicaid rebate. As a result of the delay between selling the products, dispensing the products and rebate billing, the Medicaid rebate reserve includes both an estimate of outstanding claims for end-customer sales that have occurred but for which the related claim has not been billed, as well as an estimate for future claims that will be made when inventory in the distribution channel is sold through to plan participants.
Many of the products are also covered under Medicare. ANI participates in the Coverage Gap Discount Program in order for its branded drugs to be covered by Medicare Part D and must provide a rebate for any products sold under NDAs dispensed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries while the beneficiaries are in the Coverage Gap phase of the benefit. This applies to all products sold under NDAs, regardless of whether the products are marketed as branded or generic. Estimates for these discounts are based on historical experience with Medicare rebates for products. Medicare rebates are billed quarterly for drugs dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries in the prior quarter, which is typically 120 days after the product is shipped. As a result of the delay between selling the products, dispensing the products and rebate billing, Medicare rebate reserve includes both an estimate of outstanding claims for end-customer sales that have occurred but for which the related claim has not been billed, as well as an estimate for future claims that will be made when inventory in the distribution channel is sold through to Medicare Part D participants.
To evaluate the adequacy of the government rebate reserves, reserves are reviewed on a quarterly basis against actual claims data to ensure the liability is fairly stated. The Company continually monitors the government rebate reserve and adjusts estimates if it is expected that actual government rebates may differ from established accruals. Accruals for government rebates are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and as an increase to accrued government rebates in the consolidated balance sheets.
Returns
A returns policy is in place that allows customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Generally, product may be returned for a period beginning 
six months
 prior to its expiration date to up to 
one year
 after its expiration date. Product returns are settled through the issuance of a credit to the customer. The estimate for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns. While such experience has allowed for reasonable estimation in the past, history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns. The Company continually monitors estimates for returns and make adjustments when it is expected that actual product returns may differ from the established accruals. Accruals for returns are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and as an increase to the return goods reserve in the consolidated balance sheets. Generally, the Company does not accept product returns in international markets, however, there is a limited history of returns in such areas.
Administrative Fees and Other Rebates
Administrative fees or rebates are offered to wholesalers, group purchasing organizations, and indirect customers. Fees and rebates are accrued, by product by wholesaler, at the time of sale based on contracted rates and ASPs.
To evaluate the adequacy of the administrative fee accruals, on-hand inventory counts are obtained from the wholesalers. The Company continually monitors administrative fee activity and adjust accruals when it is expected that actual administrative fees may differ from the accruals. Accruals for administrative fees and other rebates are recorded as a reduction in both gross revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and accounts receivable or accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets.

Prompt Payment Discounts
Sales discounts may be granted to customers for prompt payment. The reserve for prompt payment discounts is based on invoices outstanding. Based on past experience, it is assumed that all available discounts will be taken. Accruals for prompt payment discounts are recorded as a reduction in both gross revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets.

BUSINESS COMBINATION
Summary
On September 16, 2024 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of Alimera pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 21, 2024 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, Alimera and ANIP Merger Sub INC., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Alimera, with Alimera surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $
0.01
 per share, of Alimera (the “Alimera Common Stock”) outstanding, including each Alimera RSA (as defined below), but excluding any treasury shares or shares owned by the Company, Merger Subs or any other subsidiary of the Company or Alimera, was canceled and ceased to exist and was converted into the right to receive (i) $
5.50
 in cash (“Closing Cash Consideration”), and (ii) 
one
 contingent value right (a “CVR”), which represents the right to receive the milestone payments (as defined below) subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the CVR Agreement entered into on September 16, 2024 (collectively, the “Merger Consideration”). The CVRs have been remeasured to fair value as of December 31, 2024, see Note 12 “Fair Value” in the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements.
In addition to the amounts payable to the holders thereof in connection with the Closing, all of the outstanding awards of restricted stock with respect to shares of Alimera Common Stock (each, an “Alimera RSA”), each Alimera Performance Stock Unit (“Alimera PSU”), each Alimera Restricted Stock Unit (“Alimera RSU”) and each Alimera Warrant that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time were automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive 
one
 (1) CVR per share of Alimera Common Stock then underlying the applicable instrument.
Each stock option previously granted by Alimera to purchase Alimera Common Stock (each, an “Alimera Option”) that was outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time and which had a per share exercise price that was less than the Closing Cash Consideration was, in addition to the amounts payable to the holders thereof in connection with the Closing, automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive 
one
 (1) CVR per share of Alimera Common Stock then underlying such Alimera Option. No other Alimera Options were cancelled and converted into the right to receive a CVR, provided that each Alimera Option with a per share exercise price greater than or equal to the Closing Cash Consideration but less than the Total Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) may receive a payment in connection with the payout of the CVRs (if any).

The cash payment was funded through the New Credit Facility, see Note 6 “New Credit Agreement” in the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements, and also cash on-hand from the Company's balance sheet.
As part of the purchase consideration the Company paid approximately $
78.5
 million for the repayment of the outstanding term loan Alimera had with SLR Investment Corp., including interest payable, prepayment and end of term fees. Furthermore, the Company repaid $
20.2
 million of transaction costs incurred by Alimera.
In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company settled all outstanding equity awards held by Alimera employees, for a total cash amount of $
19.3
 million, of which, $
1.3
 million was paid in cash at the close of the Merger. Of the $
19.3
 million, $
9.5
 million was determined to be related to the pre-Merger services provided and as a result was allocated to the purchase consideration transferred. The remaining amounts were attributed to the post-Merger period and deemed to be for the benefit of the Company. As a result, $
8.8
 million was recognized as selling, general, and administrative and $
1.0
 million as research and development expense, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
The CVRs represent a form of contingent consideration and are included as part of the purchase consideration transferred. The CVRs represent the right to future cash payments for the former Alimera shareholders based on certain 2026 and 2027 revenue targets. Management determined the contingent consideration to be liability classified and will measure the liability at fair value each reporting period. The fair value of the CVRs have been estimated using a monte carlo simulation under an option pricing framework, $
8.3
 million of the total $
8.7
 million was related to the pre-combination period and recognized as consideration transferred. The remaining $
0.4
 million of the fair value of the CVR was allocated to post-merger period and recognized as selling, general, and administrative for the year ended December 31, 2024. The CVRs have been remeasured to fair value as of December 31, 2024, see Note 12 “Fair Value” in the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The preliminary purchase price allocation, measurement period adjustments, and updated purchase price allocation of the fair value of the Alimera acquisition is shown in the table below. 
The allocation of the fair value will be finalized when the valuation is completed, and the differences will be trued up for the final allocated amounts.

The net assets were recorded at their estimated fair value. In valuing acquired assets and liabilities, fair value estimates were based primarily on future expected cash flows, market rate assumptions for contractual obligations, and appropriate discount rates. 
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company updated its inventories fair value, accounts receivable, returned goods reserve, accrued government rebates, and accrued expenses and other based upon new information that was not available to the Company at the acquisition date. The Company determined that the adjustments would be considered measurement period adjustments under the accounting guidance. The Company recorded a net decrease to goodwill of approximately $
0.4
 million, as a result of the adjustments identified in the table above. 
The fair value of finished goods inventory utilizes a sales comparison approach which estimates the selling price of the inventory in completed condition less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort.
As part of the Merger, the Company acquired the product rights to ILUVIEN and YUTIQ. The fair value of the acquired intangible assets was determined using an income approach, and more specifically, the multi-period excess earnings methodology. 
The identifiable intangible assets acquired are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their remaining amortization period (in years):

The estimated deferred tax liability, recognized based on the estimated tax impact of the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of the assets and liabilities acquired, is included in Deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowance in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the preliminary aggregate purchase consideration and the values assigned to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill represents the workforce acquired, as well as future operating efficiencies and cost savings. The actual amount of goodwill will depend upon the final determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and may differ materially from this preliminary determination. Goodwill established as a result of the acquisition is tax deductible in the U.S.

% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES
Offering of Convertible Senior Notes 
On August 7, 2024, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the initial purchasers (the “Initial Purchasers”) relating to the issuance of the $
275.0
 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company granted the Initial Purchasers an option to purchase up to an additional $
41.25
 million aggregate principal amount of Notes (the “Option”) for settlement at any time during the 
thirteen days
 beginning on, and including August 7, 2024, which Option was exercised in full on August 8, 2024.
On August 13, 2024 (the “Closing Date” or “Issue Date”), the Company completed an offering of $
316.25
 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the “Indenture”) dated as of August 13, 2024 between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association (“Trustee”). The Notes are due September 1, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted. The Notes will accrue interest at a rate of 
2.25
% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2025. After deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions of approximately $
9.5
 million, but before deducting the Company’s offering expenses, the net proceeds to the Company from the offering of the Notes was approximately $
306.8
 million. After payment of the cost of entering into the Capped Call Transactions (as defined below), the Company used the remainder of the net proceeds from the Notes offering, together with cash on hand, to repay the Company’s existing senior secured credit agreement, dated as of November 19, 2021, by and among the Company, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, as guarantors, Truist Bank, as administrative agent, and other parties thereto, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”). Refer to Note 5 “Truist Credit Facility” to the notes to consolidated financial statements for the details of the extinguishment of the Credit Agreement.
The Notes are the Company’s senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with the Company’s existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company’s subsidiaries.

Conversion Options
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2029, holders of the Notes will have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events as set forth in the Indenture. All or any portion of the Notes may be converted prior to June 1, 2029 at the holders’ option upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2024, if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price of the Notes for each of at least 
20
 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (ii) during the 
five
 consecutive business days immediately after any 
ten
 consecutive trading day period (such 
ten
 consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate of the Notes on such trading day; (iii) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on the Company's common stock, as described in the Indenture; or (iv) if the Company calls such Notes for redemption.
On or after June 1, 2029 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date of the Notes, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at any time at their election. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 13.4929 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $
74.11
 per share of the Company’s common stock. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for holders that convert their Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, as described in the Indenture.
Upon conversion of the Notes, the Company will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company's conversion obligation.
The Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations described below), at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after September 1, 2027 and on or before the 61st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if (i) the notes are “Freely Tradable” (as defined in the Indenture) as of the date the Company sends the related redemption notice and all accrued and unpaid additional interest, if any, has been paid in full as of the first interest payment date occurring on or before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price on (1) each of at least 
20
 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such redemption notice; and (2) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such redemption notice. However, the Company may not redeem less than all of the outstanding Notes unless at least $
75.0
 million aggregate principal amount of Notes are outstanding and not called for redemption as of the time the Company sends the related redemption notice. The redemption price will be a cash amount equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, calling any Note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted with a conversion date that is on or after the date the Company sends the related redemption notice and on or before the second business day immediately before the related redemption date.
If certain corporate events that constitute a “Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then, subject to a limited exception for certain cash mergers, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company’s common stock.

The Notes include customary provisions relating to the occurrence of “Events of Default” (as defined in the Indenture), including breaches of covenants, breaches of warranty, change of control, nonpayment, bankruptcy, assignment, foreclosure, cessation of business, and defaults under ancillary documents. Certain of the Events of Default are subject to notice and cure periods. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants associated with the Notes.
Debt issuance costs related to the Notes totaled $
11.2
 million at inception and were comprised of discounts and commissions payable to the initial purchasers and third-party offering costs and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term. As of December 31, 2024, the unamortized debt discount and debt issuance cost of the Notes was approximately $

 million on the consolidated balance sheets. The effective interest rate during the year ended December 31, 2024 was 
3.01
%
.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Notes did not meet any of the circumstances that would allow for a conversion. The Notes were therefore not convertible as of December 31, 2024, and were classified as long-term debt on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
As of December 31, 2024, the total estimated fair value (which represents a Level 2 valuation) of the Notes is approximately $
317.6

 million of interest expense related to the amortization of deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Capped Call Transactions
In connection with the offering of Notes, on August 7, 2024 and August 8, 2024, the Company entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (“Capped Calls”). The Capped Calls each have an initial cap price of $
114.02
, which represents a premium of 
100
% over the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock on August 7, 2024. The Company used approximately $
40.6
 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to pay premiums on the Capped Calls. 
The Capped Calls are expected to generally reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 
4.3
 million
 shares of the Company's common stock. 
The Capped Calls will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. The Capped Calls are separate transactions entered into by the Company with the financial institution counterparties thereto, the Capped Calls are not part of the terms of the Notes and the Capped Calls do not change the holders’ rights under the Notes. The Capped Calls do not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as they meet the criteria for equity classification, and the capped call transaction premiums are recorded as a reduction to Additional Paid-In Capital within Shareholders’ Equity, net of deferred income taxes.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT AND HEDGING ACTIVITY
In April 2020, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with Citizens Bank, N.A. to manage its exposure to changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)LIBOR-based interest rates underlying total borrowings under term facilities related to the prior credit agreement, and the interest rate swap matures in December 2026. The Company amended its Credit Agreement to transition from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) due to the cessation of LIBOR in the third quarter of 2023, and accordingly, the interest rate swap transitioned from LIBOR to SOFR. The interest rate swap is used to manage changes in SOFR-based interest rates underlying a portion of the borrowing under the Term Facility. Concurrent with the termination of the prior credit agreement and entry into the Credit Agreement with Truist Bank, the interest rate swap with a notional value of 
$
168.6
 million
 at origin on November 21, 2021 was novated and Truist Bank became the new counterparty.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
On August 30, 2024, in connection with the New Credit Facility, the interest rate swap with a notional value of $
139.4
 million was transferred from Truist Bank to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as the new counterparty. The interest rate swap is used to manage changes in SOFR-based interest rates underlying a portion of the borrowing under the New Term Facility. The interest rate swap provides an effective fixed interest rate of 
2.313
% and is designated as an effective cash flow hedge and therefore qualifies for hedge accounting. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the notional amount of the interest rate swap was $
139.4
 million, and will remain static until maturity in December 2026. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the fair value of the interest rate swap asset recorded in other 
non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets is 
$
4.9
 million
. As of December 31, 2024, 
$
6.1
 million
 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income , net of tax in the consolidated balance she
ets.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the loss on fair value of the interest rate swaps, net of tax recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income was approximately $
2.9
 million. 
Differences between the hedged SOFR rate and the fixed rate are recorded as interest expense in the same period that the related interest is recorded for the Term Facility based on the SOFR rat
e. In the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a reduction in interest expense of $
6.3
 million and $
2.6
 million in relation to the interest rate swaps, respectively. Included in these amounts for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of $
0.8
 million of interest income and 
$
2.8
 million of interest
 expense, respectively, related to terminated and de-designated cash flow hedges.

Vendor Concentration
Raw materials are sourced for products, including API, from both domestic and international suppliers. Generally, only a single source of API is qualified for use in each product due to the costs and time required to validate a second source of supply. As a result, the Company is dependent upon current vendor
s to reliably supply the API required for on-going product manufacturing. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 
12
%, of our raw material inventory purchases were from one domestic supplier. During the year ended December 31, 2023, 
no
 single vendor represented more than 10% of our raw material inventory purchases. During the year ended December 31,

(1) Weighted average amortization period as of December 31, 2024.
Definite-lived intangible assets arising from business combinations and other asset acquisitions include intangibles such as Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”), New Drug Applications (“NDAs”) and product rights, marketing and distribution rights, customer relationships, and non-compete agreements. Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that these asset might be impaired.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company acquired Alimera, and as a result, acquired two intangible assets for ILUVIEN and YUTIQ, in the amount of $
170.0
 million and $
230.0
 million, respectively, which will be amortized over 
twelve
 years.
The Company recorded approximately $
3.6
 million of impairment losses during the three months ended December 31, 2024 related to definite-lived intangibles. There were 
no
 impairment losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, impairment losses of approximately $
0.1
 million, were recognized in relation to ANDA assets.
Amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets was 
$
60.3
 million
, $
52.3
 million, and $
49.5
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively
. See Note 12 "Fair Value" in the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements
 for more details on acquired definite-lived and in
definite-lived intangible assets.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill include primarily In-Process Research & Development (“IPR&D”) projects. IPR&D intangible assets represent the fair value of technology acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition for which the technology projects are incomplete but have substance or alternative future use. When an IPR&D project is completed (generally upon receipt of regulatory approval), then the IPR&D will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, and the Company tests for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 31, 2024, as well as with definite-lived intangibles when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company performed qualitative assessments to determine whether it was more likely than not that the assets were impaired in order to determine the necessity of performing a quantitative impairment test, under which management would calculate the asset’s fair value. When performing the qualitative assessments, the Company evaluated events and circumstances that would affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the assets. 
The Company recorded $
4.0
 million of impairment losses on indefinite-lived intangible assets, more specifically, IPR&D during the three months ended December 31, 2024. 
No
 impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
During 2023, definite-lived intangibles increased approximately $
16.4
 million, which includes $
6.8
 million which was reclassified from indefinite-lived IPR&D to acquired ANDA intangible assets upon completion of projects and launch of related products, and the Company added approximately $
9.6
 million of intangible assets, comprised of $
7.1
 million of ANDA intangible assets related to asset acquisitions with Slayback Pharma Limited Liability Company and Akorn Holding Company, $
2.0
 million in product rights related to the transaction with Alvogen, Inc., and other asset acquisitions. No amounts were reclassified from indefinite-lived IPR&D to intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2024.

FAIR VALUE
Fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability assuming an orderly transaction in the most advantageous market at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in measuring fair value.
The inputs used in measuring the fair value of cash and cash equivalents are considered to be Level 1 in accordance with the three-tier fair value hierarchy. The fair market values are based on period-end statements supplied by the various banks and brokers that held the majority of our funds. The fair value of short-term financial instruments (primarily accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities) approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. The Term Facility, which was extinguished on August 13, 2024, and the New Credit Facility bear interest rates that fluctuates with the changes in SOFR and because the variable interest rates approximate market borrowing rates available to us, the Company believes the carrying values of these borrowings approximated their fair values at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Alimera Contingent Value Rights Agreement 
On September 16, 2024, prior to consummation of the Alimera Acquisition, the Company entered into a CVR pursuant to which holders of Alimera Common Stock, as well as holders of Alimera Warrants, Alimera Options, Alimera PSUs, Alimera RSAs and Alimera RSUs, may become entitled to contingent cash payments per CVR (each, a “Milestone Payment”), such payments being contingent upon, and subject to, the achievement of: (i) $
140.0
 million in net revenue (the “2026 Milestone”) on third party sales of ILUVIEN and YUTIQ for the Company’s 2026 fiscal year (the “2026 Net Revenue”) and/or (ii) $
160.0
 million in net revenue (the “2027 Milestone” and together with the 2026 Milestone, the “Milestones”) on third party sales of ILUVIEN and YUTIQ for the Company’s 2027 fiscal year (the “2027 Net Revenue”). Each CVR entitles the holder (the “Holder”) to receive a Milestone Payment upon satisfaction of the applicable Milestones. The Milestone Payment for each CVR will equal the product (rounded to the nearest 1/100 of $0.01) of (i) $
0.25
 multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding one), the numerator of which is the amount, if any, by which the 2026 Net Revenue exceeds $
140.0
 million and the denominator of which is $
10.0
 million (subject to adjustment for the exercise price of applicable Alimera Options) and/or (ii) $
0.25
 multiplied by a fraction (not exceeding one), the numerator of which is the amount, if any, by which the 2027 Net Revenue exceeds $
160.0
 million and the denominator of which is $
15.0
 million (subject to adjustment for the exercise price of applicable Alimera Options).
If Milestones are met, the distributions in respect of the CVRs will be made on or prior to the date that is fifteen (
15
) business days following the filing by the Company of its audited financial statements with the SEC on Form 10-K in respect of the applicable year in which such Milestones have been achieved, and will be subject to a number of deductions, exceptions and limitations, including, but not limited to, certain taxes. 
The fair value of the CVR liability is based on significant unobservable inputs, which represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The Company utilized a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of the CVR liability. For each simulated path of future revenue, the payments to the CVR holders were calculated based on the contractual terms of the rights. The average payments from all simulated paths were then discounted to present value at an estimated cost of debt. 
The CVR liability had an estimated fair value of approximately 
$
9.0
 million
 as of December 31, 2024, and is classified as non-current contingent consideration in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.

Money Market Funds
Money market funds are readily convertible into cash and the net asset value of each fund on the last day of the reporting period is used to determine its fair value. Money market funds are included in Cash and cash equivalents within the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. The Company does not adjust the quoted market price for such financial instruments. The fair value of the money market funds as of 
December 31, 2024
 was approximately $
84.3
 million.

Interest Rate Swap
The fair value of the interest rate swap is estimated based on the present value of projected future cash flows using the SOFR forward rate curve. The fair value of the interest rate swap is estimated based on the present value of projected future cash flows using the SOFR forward rate curve (see Note 6 "New Credit Agreement" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements). The model used to value the interest rate swap includes inputs of readily observable market data, a Level 2 input. As described in further detail in Note 8 “Derivative Financial Instrument and Hedging Activity” to the notes to consolidated financial statements. As described in detail in Note 8, the fair value of the interest rate swap was a $
4.9
 million and $
6.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was classified as a non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
CG Oncology Equity Securities
The Company currently holds 
219,925
 shares of common stock in CG Oncology (Nasdaq: CGON). The Company accounts for its investment in CG Oncology equity securities as an equity investment with a readily determinable fair value, as the securities are publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The fair value of the equity securities is based on its closing price on the Nasdaq and is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because the equity securities are valued using quoted market prices. The Company does not adjust the quoted market price for such financial instruments. The fair value of the CG Oncology equity securities as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $
6.3
 million based on a closing market price of $
28.68
 on December 31, 2024. This amount is classified on the consolidated statements of operations as Unrealized gain on investment in equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2024. Between 2013 and 2023, CG Oncology securities held by the Company were valued at zero under U.S. GAAP.
Novitium Contingent Consideration
In connection with the acquisition of Novitium, the Company may pay up to $
46.5
 million in additional consideration related to the achievement of certain milestones, including milestones on gross profit of Novitium portfolio products over a 
24-month
 period, regulatory filings completed during this 
24-month
 period, and a percentage of net profits on certain products that are launched in the future.
The discounted cash flow method used to value this contingent consideration includes inputs of not readily observable market data, which are Level 3 inputs. As of the November 19, 2021 acquisition date, the contingent consideration had a fair value of $
30.8
 million. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, on December 12, 2023, the Company paid $
12.5
 million of cash consideration to the Company Members, defined as the holders of Novitium ownership interests in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, as the holders of Novitium ownership interests, for the achievement of the "ANDA Filing Earn-Out," as defined in the Agreement (see Note 18 "Related Party Transactions" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements). Furthermore, on February 22, 2024, the Company paid $
12.5
 million to Company Members of Novitium upon the achievement of the "Gross Profit Earn-Out," as defined in the Agreement.
The fair value of the contingent consideration was approximately $
10.9
 million and $
24.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is reflected as a current and non-current accrued contingent consideration liability in the consolidated balance sheets.

Accrued Licensor Payments
On May 17, 2023, Alimera entered into the Product Rights Agreement with EyePoint which granted Alimera an exclusive and sublicensable right and license under EyePoint’s and its affiliates’ interest in certain of EyePoint’s and its affiliates’ intellectual property to develop, manufacture, sell, commercialize and otherwise exploit certain products, including YUTIQ, for the treatment and prevention of uveitis in the entire world, except Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where the Company already has such rights pursuant to the New Collaboration Agreement, and except for China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Brunei, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, where Ocumension holds a license from EyePoint. Pursuant to the agreement, Alimera paid EyePoint an upfront payment of $
75.0
 million and has also made 
four
 quarterly guaranteed payments to EyePoint totaling $
7.5
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.
The Company will also pay royalties to EyePoint from 2025 to 2028 at a percentage of mid-to-low double digits of annual U.S. net sales of certain products (including YUTIQ and ILUVIEN) in excess of certain thresholds, beginning at $
70.0
 million in 2025, increasing annually thereafter. Upon making the quarterly payments in the aggregate amount of $
7.5
 million in 2024, the licenses and rights granted to the Company will automatically become perpetual and irrevocable. 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company paid the final quarterly payment of $
1.9
 million. The present value of the remaining payments to EyePoint for years 2025 to 2028 will continue to be revalued at an appropriate discount rate for the Company at each reporting date until they are settled. The fair value of the remaining future payments as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $

Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, ROU assets, intangible assets, and goodwill, are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 there were $
7.6
 million and $
0
 of impairment charges recognized related to non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, respectively.  During the year ended December 31, 2022, impairment losses of approximately $
0.1
 million, were recognized in relation to ANDA assets.
Acquired Non-Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value
On September 16, 2024, the Company acquired ILUVIEN and YUTIQ in connection with the acquisition of Alimera. See Note 3 “Business Combination” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
On December 27, 2023, the Company acquired from Alvogen, Inc. the rights to certain pharmaceutical products for total cash consideration of $
2.0
 million (Note 8), which launched commercially in early 2024. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition and there were no transaction costs directly related to the acquisition. Intangible assets amounted to $
2.0
 million as NDAs and product rights. The payment was allocated to the acquired intangible assets based on relative fair value, which was determined using Level 3 unobservable inputs. The intangible asset will be amortized in full over its useful life of 
seven years
 and will be tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. No such triggering events were identified during the period from the date of acquisition to December 31, 2024.
On August 14, 2023, the Company acquired 
one
 ANDA and registered patents and pending patent applications from Slayback Pharma Limited 
Liability Company for total consideration of $
3.0
 million. The Company also acquired an NDA which has yet to be filed. The transaction was funded from cash on hand. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition and the transaction costs directly related to the acquisition were capitalized. Intangible assets amounted to $
2.8
 million as acquired ANDA intangible assets. The payment was allocated to the acquired intangible assets based on relative fair value, which was determined using Level 3 unobservable inputs. The ANDA will be amortized in full over its useful life of 
seven years
 and will be tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. No such triggering events were identified during the period from the date of acquisition to 
December 31, 2024
, and therefore 
no
 impairment loss was recognized for the year ended 
December 31, 2024
.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company acquired 
two
 ANDAs and 
one
 pipeline product from the Chapter 7 Trustee for the estates of Akorn Holding Company and certain of its affiliates for total consideration of $
4.8
 million. The transaction was funded from cash on hand. This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition and the transaction costs directly related to the acquisition were capitalized. The product portfolio included 
two
 commercial products and 
one
 pipeline product. The Company recognized $
4.3
 million as acquired ANDA intangible assets. The payment was allocated to the acquired intangible assets and in-process research and development based on relative fair value, which was determined using Level 3 unobservable inputs. The ANDAs will be amortized in full over its useful life of 
seven years
 and will be tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. No such triggering events were identified during the period from the date of acquisition to December 31, 2024, and therefore 
no
 impairment loss was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
On July 21, 2022, ANI acquired 
four
 ANDAs from Oakrum Pharma, LLC for total consideration of $
8.0
 million plus an immaterial amount for the purchase of finished goods inventory. The transaction was funded from cash on hand. ANI accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and capitalized the transaction costs directly related to the acquisition. The product portfolio included 
one
 commercial product, 
one
 approved product with a launch completed in September 2022 and 
two
 filed products, with approval pending. ANI recognized $
7.2
 million as acquired ANDA intangible assets and $
1.2
 million as research and development expense because certain of the generic products have significant remaining work required in order to be commercialized and the products do not have an alternative future use. The payment was allocated to the acquired intangible assets and in-process research and development based on relative fair value, which was determined using Level 3 unobservable inputs. ANI used the present value of the estimated cash flows related to the products, using a discount rate of 
13
% to determine the fair value of the acquired intangible assets and in-process research and development. The inventory acquired was immaterial. Contingent liabilities are accrued when they are both estimable and probable. ANI accrued $
0.2
 million in contingent payments due to a third party upon the launch of a product completed in September 2022. This was accrued and recorded in the fair value of acquired intangible assets as it was probable at the acquisition date and has been paid in 2023. The ANDAs will be amortized in full over its useful life of 
seven years
 and will be tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. No such triggering events were identified during the period from the date of acquisition to December 31, 2024, and therefore 
no
 impairment loss was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Mezzanine Equity
PIPE Shares
Concurrently with the acquisition of Novitium, and as financing for a portion of the acquisition, on March 8, 2021, the Company entered into an Equity Commitment and Investment Agreement with Ampersand 2020 Limited Partnership (the “PIPE Investor”), pursuant to which the PIPE Investor agreed to purchase, 
25,000
 shares of 
the Company's
 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “PIPE Shares”), for a purchase price of $
1,000
 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $
25.0
 million on November 19, 2021. The PIPE Shares are classified as mezzanine equity because the shares are mandatorily redeemable for cash upon a change in control, an event that is not solely in 
the Company's
 control. The Company incurred $
0.2
 million in issuance costs associated with the transaction.
The PIPE Shares accrue dividends at 
6.50
% per year on a cumulative basis, payable in cash or in-kind, and will also participate, on a pro-rata basis, in any dividends that may be declared with respect to the Company's common stock. The PIPE Shares are convertible into the Company's common shares at the conversion price of $
41.47
 (i) beginning 
two years
 years after their issuance date, at the election of ANI (in which case the PIPE Investor must convert all of the PIPE Shares), if the volume-weighted average price of the Company's common stock for any 
20
 trading days out of 
30
 consecutive trading days exceeds 
170
% of the conversion price, and (ii) at any time after issuance, at the election of the PIPE Investor. As of December 31, 2024, the PIPE shares are currently convertible into a maximum of 
602,901
 shares of the Company's common stock.
In case of a liquidation event, the holder of the PIPE Shares will be entitled to receive, in preference to holders of the Company's common stock, the greater of (i) the PIPE Shares’ purchase price plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon and (ii) the amount the holder of the PIPE Shares would have received in the liquidation event if it had converted its PIPE Shares into 
the Company's
 common stock. The PIPE Shares will have voting rights, voting as one series with 
the Company's
 common stock, on as-converted basis, and will have separate voting rights on any (i) amendment to the Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Certificate”) that adversely amends and relates solely to the terms of the PIPE Shares and (ii) issuance of additional Series A convertible preferred stock. In case of a change of control of 
the Company
, the PIPE Shares will be redeemed at the greater of (i) the PIPE Shares’ purchase price plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon and (ii) the change of control transaction consideration that the holder of the PIPE Shares would have received if it had converted into 
the Company's
 common stock.
There were 
25,000
 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
For periods of net income, and when the effects are not anti-dilutive, the Company calculates diluted earnings (loss) per share by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus the impact of all potential dilutive common shares, consisting primarily of common stock options, shares to be purchased under our ESPP, and performance stock units, using the more dilutive of the treasury stock or the two-class method. For periods of net loss, diluted loss per share is calculated similarly to basic loss per share.
Unvested restricted shares and Series A convertible preferred stock shares contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, and therefore are considered to be participating securities; in periods of net income, the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share excludes from the numerator net income (but not net loss) attributable to the unvested restricted shares and the common shares assumed converted from the preferred shares and excludes the impact of those shares from the denominator. The Company’s participating securities do not have a co
ntractual obligation to share in the Company’s losses. As such, the net loss was attributed entirely to common stockholders. As the Company has reported a net loss for the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, diluted net loss per share attributable to common shareholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common shareholders for this period.
Earnings (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 are calculated for basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share as follows:

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In July 2016, the Company commenced administration of the ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2016 ESPP. As of December 31, 2024, there are approximately 
0.1
 million shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP. Under the ESPP, participants can purchase shares of common stock at a 
15
% discount on the lowest share price on the first day of the purchase period or the last day of the purchase period.
Stock Incentive Plan 
During the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 21, 2024, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”) (such amendment, the “2024 Stock Plan Amendment” and the 2022 Plan, after giving effect to the 2024 Stock Plan Amendment, the “Amended 2022 Stock Plan”). Subject to adjustment, the 2024 Stock Plan Amendment authorizes the issuance of an additional 
1,610,000
 shares.
As of December 31, 2024, approximately 
2.0
 million
 shares of common stock were available for issuance under the 2022 Plan.
Equity-based service awards are granted under the ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Amended and Restated 2022 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”), which was approved by the Company's stockholders at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”) held on April 27, 2022. Prior to this approval, the Company granted equity-based incentive awards under the Sixth Amended and Restated 2008 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2008 Plan”), which was renamed, amended and restated to the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan, among other things, increased the number of shares reserved for issuance thereunder by 
1,150,000
 shares. On May 23, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2022 Plan (such amendment, the “2023 Stock Plan Amendment”). Subject to adjustment, the 2023 Stock Plan Amendment increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan by 
750,000
 shares.
From time to time, the Company may grant stock options to employees through an inducement grant outside of the 2022 Plan to induce prospective employees to accept employment with us (the “Inducement Grants”). The options are granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a share of the common stock on the respective grant date and are generally exercisable in 
four
 equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the respective grant date. The grants are made pursuant to inducement grants outside of the stockholder approved equity plan as permitted under the Nasdaq Stock Market listing rules.
The cost of equity-based service awards are measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost is recognized ratably over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting periods of the awards.
The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense incurred for ESPP expense incurred under the 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, stock options, restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock units, and Inducement Grants and included in the consolidated statements of operations:

There were no grants of stock options during 2024. 
For 2023, and 2022, the fair value of each option grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, using the following assumptions:

The Company uses the simplified method to estimate the expected option life of options. The risk-free interest rate used is the yield on a U.S. Treasury note as of the grant date with a maturity equal to the estimated life of the option. The calculated estimated volatility rate is based on ANI's historical stock price. The Company has not issued a cash dividend on the common shares in the past nor does the Company have any current plans to do so in the future; therefore, an expected dividend yield of 
zero
 was used.

Restricted Stock Awards
Restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) granted to employees generally vest over a period of 
four years
. RSAs granted to non-officer directors generally vest over a period of 
one year
.
Shares of common stock delivered to employees and directors will be unrestricted upon vesting. During the vesting period, the recipient of the restricted stock has full voting rights as a stockholder and would receive dividends, if declared, even though the restricted stock remains subject to transfer restrictions and will generally be forfeited upon termination of the officer prior to vesting. The fair value of each RSA is based on the market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant.

February 14, 2024 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units Grant
On February 14, 2024, the Company granted 
73,588
 PSUs to officers and employees of the Company under the 2022 Plan (
66,433
 to officers of the Company). PSU performance will be measured over a

 performance period from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026 and will cliff-vest contingent upon the achievement of specified performance objectives. Of these PSUs, 
50
% were MPRSUs, vesting of which is contingent upon the Company meeting certain TSR levels as compared to a select peer group over the over 
three years
 starting January 1, 2024, and 
50
% of the PSUs were PRSUs, vesting of which is contingent upon the Company meeting certain adjusted non-GAAP year-on-year EBITDA growth rates over the over 
three years
 starting January 1, 2024. Both the MPRSUs and the PRSUs have a maximum potential to vest at

February 28, 2023 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units Grant
On February 28, 2023, as part of the Company's equity compensation program, PSUs were granted to certain executives. Of these PSUs, 
50
% were market performance-based restricted stock units (“MPRSUs”), vesting of which is contingent upon the Company meeting certain total shareholder return (“TSR”) levels as compared to a select peer group over the over 
three
 years starting January 1, 2023. The MPRSUs are also subject to the recipient’s continued employment or service through December 31, 2025. The MPRSUs cliff vest at the end of the 
three
-year period and have a maximum potential to vest at 
200
% (
85,099
 shares) based on TSR performance. The related share-based compensation expense is determined based on the estimated fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant and is recognized straight-line over the vesting term. The estimated grant date fair value per share of the MPRSUs was $
68.65
 and was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The MPRSUs are included at 
100
% of the estimate number of shares at the end of the 
three
-year performance period and are reflected under “Granted” in the table below.
The other 
50
% of the PSUs were performance based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”), vesting of which is contingent upon the Company meeting certain adjusted non-GAAP year-on-year EBITDA growth rates over the over 
three
 years starting January 1, 2023. The PRSUs are also subject to the recipient’s continued employment or service through December 31, 2025. The PRSUs cliff vest at the end of the three-year period and have a maximum potential to vest at 
200
% (
85,099
 shares) based on adjusted non-GAAP year-on-year EBITDA growth rates. The related share-based compensation expense is determined based on the estimated fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant and is recognized straight-line over the vesting term. At each reporting period, the Company analyzes progress on the performance goals to assess the likelihood of achievement. The estimated grant date fair value per share of the PRSUs was $
41.84
 based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The PRSUs are included at 
100
% of the estimated number of shares at the end of the 
three

INCOME TAXES
The foreign current and foreign deferred (benefits) expenses below represent our tax (benefit) expense from Canada, India, United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal, and Germany jurisdictions.
The Company is required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers the projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the consolidated valuation allowance was $
9.5
 million and $
0.4
 million, respectively, primarily related to deferred tax assets for net operating losses in the UK and and U.S. state jurisdictions. The Company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $
7.5
 million in connection with the acquisition of Alimera, and recorded an additional increase in the valuation allowance of approximately $
1.5
 million during the three months ended 
December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards were approximately $
55.6
 million and UK net operating losses of approximately $
50.8
 million, primarily arose as a result of the acquisition of Alimera and the 2013 merger with BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Net operating loss carryforwards related to the 2024 acquisition are indefinite lived. Net operating loss carryforwards related to the 2013 merger, if not used, expire in annual increments through 2033. All of the net operating loss carryforwards are limited on an annual basis as prescribed by Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; the current annual limitation is approximately $
7.2
 million per year. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, the Company has total net operating losses in various states of $
5.7
 million which begin to expire through 2042.
The Company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in evaluating tax positions and determining the expense for income taxes. The Company established liabilities for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These liabilities are established when the Company believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjusts these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit. The expense for income taxes includes the impact of changes to the liability that is considered appropriate. The Company has not identified any material uncertain income tax positions as of 
December 31, 2024
 and 2023.
The Company is subject to income tax audits in all jurisdictions for which tax returns are filed. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. All of the Company's income tax returns remain subject to examination by tax authorities due to the availability of net operating loss carryforwards.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Operating Leases
The majority of the Com
pany's leases as of December 31, 2024 are classified as operating leases. 
Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, and the Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts. The Company’s lease agreements do not provide for determination of the interest rate implicit in the lease. Therefore, the Company used a benchmark approach to derive an appropriate incremental borrowing rate. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The Company benchmarked itself against other companies of similar credit ratings and comparable quality and derived an incremental borrowing rate, which was used to discount its lease liabilities. 
Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets are included in other non-current assets and operating lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 
In April 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to lease additional warehouse space in East Windsor, New Jersey. The lease has a term of 
five years
, and is classified as an operating lease. Additionally, during October 2023, the Company entered into an amendment for the Middleton, Wisconsin location which expanded the Company
’
s square footage and also extended the termination date to December 2028. 
In connection with the acquisition of Alimera, the Company acquired operating leases for office space in Alpharetta, Georgia, which has a remaining term of approximately 
five years
. The Company also entered into a new lease agreement in Princeton, New Jersey, for office space which is expected to have a commencement date during 2025. The Princeton, New Jersey lease will have a remaining term of approximately 
10
 years. 
As of December 31, 2024, there are 
15
 operating leases for facilities and office equipment with remaining terms expiring from 2025 through 2029 and a weighted average remaining lease terms of 
3.8
 years and 
3.9
 years, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Many of the operating leases have fair value renewal options, none of which are considered certain of being exercised or included in the minimum lease term. The weighted average incremental borrowing rates as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 is 
8.10
% and 
8.12
%, respectively.

Finance Leases 
In connection with the acquisition of Alimera, the Company acquired finance leases primarily consisting of automobiles. The automobiles are capitalized at the lesser of fair market value or the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the leases using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company’s finance lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Finance lease ROU assets are included in other non-current assets, specifically in Property and equipment, net, and finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Government Regulation
The Company's products and facilities are subject to regulation by a number of federal and state governmental agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (“CDSCO”), The Narcotics Control Bureau (“NCB”), and India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (“MoHFW”). The FDA, in particular, maintains oversight of the formulation, manufacture, distribution, packaging, and labeling of all of ANI's products. The DEA and NCB maintain oversight over products that are considered controlled substances. 
Unapproved Products
Four
 products, Esterified Estrogen with Methyltestosterone (“EEMT”), Opium Tincture, Thyroid Tablets, and Hyoscyamine are marketed without approved NDAs or ANDAs. 
On December 27, 2023, the Company acquired from Alvogen, Inc. the rights to Hyoscyamine for total cash consideration of $
2.0
 million, which product was launched commercially in February 2024. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, net revenues from the commercial sales of these products totaled $
22.4
 million, $
22.4
 million, and $
14.2
 million, respectively. Before acquisition of Hyoscyamine, contract manufacturing revenues for Hyoscyamine, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $
0.1
 million, $
1.9
 million and $
2.6
 million, respectively. 
The FDA's policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products appears in the FD
A's September 2011 Compliance Policy Guide Sec. 440.100 titled “Marketed New Drugs without Approved NDAs or ANDAs.” Under this policy, the FDA has stated that it will follow a risk-based approach with regard to enforcement against marketing of unapproved products. The FDA evaluates whether to initiate enforcement action on a case-by-case basis, but gives higher priority to enforcement action against products in certain categories, such as those with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness. 
The Company believes that, so long as it complies with applicable manufacturing standards, the FDA will continue to operate on a risk-based approach and will not take action against us. However, the Company can offer no assurance that the FDA will continue to follow this approach or that it will not take a contrary position with any individual product or group of products. If the FDA were to move away from the risk-based approach to enforcement against marketing of unapproved products, ANI may be required to seek FDA approval for these products or withdraw such products from the market. If the Company decides to withdraw the products from the market, net revenues for generic pharmaceutical products could decline materially, and if the Company decides to seek FDA approval, it would face increased expenses and might need to suspend sales of the products until such approval was obtained, and there are no assurances that it would receive such approval.
Legal proceedings 
The Company is involved, and from time to time may become involved, in various disputes, governmental and/or regulatory inquiries, investigations, government reimbursement related actions and litigation. These matters are complex and subject to significant uncertainties. While the Company believes that it have valid claims and/or defenses in the litigation and other matters described below, litigation is inherently unpredictable, particularly where the damages sought are substantial or indeterminate or when the proceedings, investigations or inquiries are in the early stages, and the outcome of the proceedings could result in losses, including substantial damages, fines, civil or criminal penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies. The Company intends to vigorously prosecute and/or defend these matters, as appropriate; however, from time to time, ANI may settle or otherwise resolve these matters on terms and conditions that it believes are in the Company's best interests. Resolution of any or all claims, investigations, and legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or cash flows in any given accounting period or on our overall financial condition.
Unless otherwise disclosed, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the matter or to provide an estimate of the range of reasonably possible material losses. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies to the extent it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
From time to time, the Company may also be involved in other pending proceedings for which, in our opinion based upon facts and circumstances known at the time, either the likelihood of loss is remote or any reasonably possible loss associated with the resolution of such proceedings is not expected to be material to our results, and therefore remain undisclosed. If and when any reasonably possible losses associated with the resolution of such other pending proceedings, in our opinion, become material, ANI will disclose such matters.
Furthermore, like many pharmaceutical manufacturers, the Company is periodically exposed to product liability claims. The prevalence of these claims could limit our coverage under future insurance policies or cause those policies to become more expensive, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Recent trends in the product liability and director and officer insurance markets is to exclude matters related to certain classes of drugs. Our policies have been subject to such exclusions which place further potential risk of financial loss on us.
Legal fees for litigation-related matters are expensed as incurred and included in the consolidated statements of operations under the selling, general, and administrative expense line item. 
Commercial Litigation 
On December 3, 2020, class action complaints were filed against the Company on behalf of putative classes of direct and indirect purchasers of the drug Bystolic. On December 23, 2020, 
six
 individual purchasers of Bystolic, CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreen, Kroger, Albertsons, and H-E-B, filed complaints against the Company. On March 15, 2021, the plaintiffs in these actions filed amended complaints. All amended complaints were substantively identical. The plaintiffs in these actions alleged that, beginning in 2012, Forest Laboratories, the manufacturer of Bystolic, entered into anticompetitive agreements when settling patent litigation related to Bystolic with 
seven
 potential manufacturers of a generic version of Bystolic: Hetero, Torrent, Alkem/Indchemie, Glenmark, Amerigen, Watson, and various of their corporate parents, successors, subsidiaries, and affiliates. ANI itself was not a party to patent litigation with Forest concerning Bystolic and did not settle patent litigation with Forest. The plaintiffs named the Company as a defendant based on the Company’s January 8, 2020 Asset Purchase Agreement with Amerigen. Under the terms of the 2020 Asset Purchase Agreement, Amerigen agreed to indemnify ANI for certain liabilities relating to Bystolic, including liabilities that arose prior to closing of the asset purchase. The complaints alleged that the 2013 patent litigation settlement agreement between Forest and Amerigen violated federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws by delaying the market entry of generic versions of Bystolic. Plaintiffs alleged they paid higher prices as a result of delayed generic competition. Plaintiffs sought damages, trebled or otherwise multiplied under applicable law, injunctive relief, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees. The complaints did not specify the amount of damages sought from the Company or other defendants and the Company. The cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On April 23, 2021, the Company and other defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaints. On January 24, 2022, the court dismissed all claims brought by the plaintiffs without prejudice. The court granted the plaintiffs until February 22, 2022 to file amended complaints, which were filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, on that date. The newly amended complaints contained substantially similar claims. On April 19, 2022, the Company and other defendants filed motions to dismiss the newly amended complaints. After full briefing and oral argument, on February 21, 2023, the court granted the Company and the defendants’ motion to dismiss all actions with prejudice. Plaintiffs filed an appeal in the Second Circuit. On May 13, 2024, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment, dismissing plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
On March 4, 2024, ANI commenced a civil action against CG Oncology, Inc. f/k/a Cold Genesys, Inc. (“CG Oncology”) in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (“Delaware Action”). ANI’s complaint alleges that, under an Assignment and Technology Transfer Agreement dated as of November 15, 2010 (the “November 2010 Agreement”), CG Oncology is liable to pay ANI a running royalty of 
5
% of the worldwide net sales of cretostimogene made by CG Oncology or any affiliate or sublicensee thereof; and that in February 2024, CG Oncology wrongfully repudiated its royalty obligation to ANI. On April 2, 2024, CG Oncology filed an answer and counterclaim (the “CGON Answer and Counterclaim”) and concurrently moved for judgment on the pleadings or, in the alternative, for partial summary judgment (the “Motion for Summary Judgment”). CG Oncology’s Motion for Summary Judgment seeks judgment declaring that the November 2010 Agreement does not “oblige CGON to pay royalties after expiration of the latest-running assigned patent.” CG Oncology also seeks judgment awarding compensatory damages and punitive damages on counterclaims for alleged breach of the November 2010 Agreement and for alleged misappropriation of trade secrets under federal and Delaware state law. On April 22 and 25, 2024, ANI filed its reply to CG Oncology’s counterclaims, denying any liability to CG Oncology and asserting additional counterclaims against CG Oncology (“Reply Counterclaims”) for alleged breach of the November 2010 Agreement and, in the alternative, for unjust enrichment. ANI’s Reply Counterclaims seek judgment (i) declaring that, under Section 3.3 of the November 2010 Agreement, CG Oncology is contractually obligated to pay ANI

On May 15, 2024, CG Oncology filed a reply to ANI’s counterclaims, which generally maintains the positions in the CGON Answer and Counterclaim. The parties are currently engaged in pretrial fact discovery. On August 22, 2024, the court heard the parties' oral arguments in a hearing on CG Oncology’s Motion for Summary Judgment. On November 18, 2024, the court issued its decision denying CG Oncology's Motion for Summary Judgment. The deadline for submitting amendments or supplements to the pleadings has passed. The court entered the case management order on January 16, 2025 and trial is scheduled to commence on July 21, 2025. ANI intends to vigorously pursue this matter.
On March 5, 2024, a complaint was filed against ANI by Acella Pharmaceuticals, LLC, in the United States District Court of Minnesota, asserting, among other things, false advertising under the Lanham Act, and unfair trade practices and false advertising under Minnesota law, relating to ANI’s natural desiccated thyroid tablets USP. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, actual and consequential damages, disgorgement of profits, and attorneys’ fees and costs. On April 16, 2024, ANI filed an answer to Acella’s complaint, denying all claims, and asserting certain affirmative defenses, and counterclaims against Acella for false advertising of its thyroid product marketed as NP Thyroid® Tablets, under the Lanham Act, common law unfair competition and unfair and deceptive trade practices and false advertising under Minnesota and Georgia law. ANI seeks injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. On May 17, 2024, Acella filed a motion to dismiss ANI’s counterclaims. On June 7, 2024, ANI filed an amended answer to Acella’s complaint and counterclaims. Acella filed a motion to dismiss ANI’s amended counterclaims on July 31, 2024. A hearing was held on September 11, 2024 on Acella’s motion to dismiss. On December 18, 2024, the court issued an order denying Acella's motion. The parties have been unable to reach a settlement and have agreed to an extension for fact discovery until July 1, 2025. Trial is currently scheduled to begin as early as April 2026. ANI disputes any liability in this matter and intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously.

Patent Litigation
On November 21, 2023, a complaint was filed against Novitium and certain other defendants in the case of Harmony Biosciences, LLC, Bioprojet Societe Civile de Recherche and Bioprojet Pharma SAS v. AET Pharma US, Inc., Annora Pharma Private Limited, Novitium Pharma LLC, Zenara Pharma Private Limited and Biophore India Pharmaceuticals Private Limited in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting, among other things, that Novitium’s proposed pitolisant hydrochloride drug product, which is subject to Novitium’s Abbreviated New Drug Application, infringes certain U.S. patents owned by the plaintiffs. The complaint seeks damages, injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and costs. On January 29, 2024, Novitium filed its answer, denying all allegations and asserting counterclaims of non-infringement and invalidity. On February 16, 2024, plaintiffs filed their answer, denying Novitium’s counterclaims and asserting certain affirmative defenses against Novitium. On April 15, 2024, the court consolidated Novitium’s case and two other cases brought by plaintiffs against Lupin Limited et al, and MSN Pharms. Inc. et al., into one consolidated matter filed in C.A. No. 23-1286-JLH. The case is currently in discovery. The court set a trial date for February 2026.

Ranitidine Related Litigation
Federal Court Multi District Litigation
ANI and Novitium were named as defendants, along with numerous other brand and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, retail pharmacy chains, and repackagers of ranitidine-containing products, in 
In re: Zantac/Ranitidine NDMA Litigation
 (MDL No, 2924), filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the “MDL Court”). Plaintiffs allege that defendants failed to disclose and/or concealed the alleged inherent presence of N-Nitrosodimethylamine (or “NDMA”) in brand-name Zantac or generic ranitidine and the alleged associated risk of cancer. While ANI was initially a defendant, the lead plaintiff attorneys voluntarily dismissed ANI as a defendant in the Master Complaint. On July 8, 2021, the MDL Court dismissed all claims by all plaintiffs against the generic drug manufacturers with prejudice , on preemption grounds. The MDL Court also dismissed all claims by all plaintiffs against the brand manufacturers on summary judgment. Plaintiffs appealed the MDL Court’s dismissals to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. On November 7, 2022, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the MDL Court’s dismissal of cases brought by third-party payors. The Eleventh Circuit raised questions in the appeals of the other cases about the finality of the MDL Court’s judgments, which were resolved in September 2023. Plaintiffs filed opening briefs on April 10, 2024 and generics defendants filed their response on July 25, 2024.
ANI and Novitium dispute any liability in this matter.
State Court Personal Injury Litigation
ANI and Novitium have also been named as defendants in various state lawsuits.
California.
 The pending cases in California state court naming generic ranitidine manufacturers were transferred to an existing civil case coordination docket for pretrial proceedings (JCCP) in Alameda County. On September 21, 2023, plaintiffs filed a master complaint in the JCCP alleging strict liability, negligent failure to warn and general negligence, but not naming any generic defendants. Plaintiffs filed an amended master complaint on April 29, 2024 and filed a second amended master complaint on July 2, 2024. Defendants filed omnibus demurrers to the complaint. Novitium is named in one third wave case. The court heard arguments for the demurrers on August 22, 2024 and issued its final ruling on August 28, 2024, allowing some counts to survive. The surviving counts as to generic defendants include strict liability (manufacturing defect) and general negligence (storage and transport, failure to warn and product containers). Novitium filed its answer to the second amended master complaint on September 6, 2024.  Discovery is currently ongoing.

In December 2023, the Keller Postman firm filed approximately 
200
 individual plaintiff short form complaints that name generic defendants. Novitium is named in 
29
 of the short form complaints which reference the claims for the master complaint, but Novitium has not been served. ANI is not named. On February 1, 2024, the generic defendants filed an omnibus demurrer challenging the sufficiency of the Keller Postman complaints, largely on the basis of preemption. On April 23, 2024, the California court sustained the demurrer in part, dismissing all design defect claims against the generic defendants with prejudice on preemption grounds, but the court otherwise granted plaintiffs an opportunity for leave to amend their other claims against the generic defendants. Plaintiffs filed amended short form complaints on September 20, 2024 and defendants filed responses on October 6, 2024. Pleadings are now closed and discovery is currently ongoing.
Pennsylvania.
 In September 2022, 
two
 complaints were filed naming Novitium as a defendant in Pennsylvania state court, Philadelphia County. On February 16, 2023, the Pennsylvania plaintiffs filed a consolidated long-form complaint against the generic defendants, Plaintiffs v. Actavis, et. al. Civil Action No. 1364. The long-form complaint names Novitium as a defendant. The long form complaint asserts causes of action for negligence, failure to warn, negligent storage and transportation, breach of express warranties, breach of implied warranties, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, strict products liability, wrongful death and survivor actions, and loss of consortium. The complaint includes a prayer for punitive damages. The generic defendants filed their preliminary objections to Plaintiffs’ consolidated long-form generic complaint on March 20, 2023. The court dismissed all claims related to failure to warn/design defects on preemption grounds. The court also sustained the generics’ preliminary objections relating to the counts of strict liability-design defect and breach of implied warranty to the extent Pennsylvania substantive law applies, effectively dismissing the generic defendants from the case unless and until a non-resident plaintiff names a generic in a short form complaint. Out of an abundance of caution, however, the generics, including Novitium, all filed answers to the long form complaint in June 2023. In January 2024, plaintiffs filed short form complaints naming generic defendants, including Novitium in 
one
 complaint. Generic defendants filed joint preliminary objections to the short form complaints based on preemption. The deadline for filing responses to these objections has passed. In addition, Novitium was not named in any amended short form complaint filed by plaintiffs 
ANI and Novitium dispute any liability in these matters.

SEGMENT REPORTING
An operating segment is defined as a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may recognize revenues and incur expense, its operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and its discrete financial information is available. The CODM for the Company is the Chief Executive Officer. The Company does not aggregate its operating segments for reporting purposes, and therefore, the reportable segments are the same as its operating segments.
Following the acquisition of Alimera and during the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company reorganized the segment information that is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker which caused the identification of significant segment expenses to change. Therefore, the Company recasted prior period segment information to conform to the current-period presentation in accordance with the segment guidance at ASC 280-10-50-34.
The Company is now organized into 
two
 operating segments a
s follows:
•
Rare Disease and Brands 
 – Consists of two reporting units, Rare Disease and Brands. The Rare Disease unit consists of operations related to the development, manufacturing and marketing of proprietary branded pharmaceutical products, with a strategic focus on products used in the treatment of patients with rare disease conditions and consists of operations related to Cortrophin Gel, and from September 16, 2024, through December 31, 2024, ILUVIEN and YUTIQ. In addition, the Brands reporting unit includes a portfolio of approximately 
16
 brand products that are principally sold in highly genericized markets.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
•
Generics and Other
 – Consists of operations related to the development, manufacturing, and marketing of generic pharmaceutical products including those sold through traditional wholesale and retail sales channels, sales of contract manufactured products, royalties on contract manufactured products, product development services, and other. As of December 31, 2024, this reporting segment was comprised of over 
100
 product families.
The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company as 
two
 operating segments based on revenues and Operating income (loss), exclusive of corporate expenses and other expenses not directly allocated or attributable to an operating segment. These expenses include, but are not limited to, certain management, legal, accounting, human resources, insurance, an
d information technology expenses, and 
transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisition of Alimera and other acquisitions
.
The Company does not manage assets of the Company by operating segment and the CODM does not review asset information by operating segment. Accordingly, the Company does not present total assets by operating segment. 
Financial information by reportable segment is as follows:

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management has carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of 
December 31, 2024
. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well d
esigned and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
•
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets
•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. 
The scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting includes all of the Company's consolidated operations except for the operations of Alimera, which the Company acquired on September 16, 2024.
