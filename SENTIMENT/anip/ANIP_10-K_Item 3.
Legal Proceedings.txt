CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and certain information incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future operations, strategies and growth potential, the revenue potential (licensing, royalty and sales) of products we sell, development timelines, expected timeframe for submission of new drug applications, abbreviated new drug applications, or supplemental new drug applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), pipeline or potential markets for our products, selling and marketing strategies a

“
Alimera
”
), impact of accounting principle
s, litigation expenses, liquidity and capital resources, the impact of global pandemics on our business, and other statements that are not historical in nature, particularly those that utilize terminology such as “anticipates,” “will,” “expects,” “plans,” “potential,” “future,” “believes,” “intends,” “continue,” other words of similar meaning, derivations of such words, and the use of future dates. Such forward-looking statements are based on the reasonable beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to our management. Readers should not put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified; therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including those discussed in the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A.of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the following factors: 
•
Our approved products, including Cortrophin Gel, ILUVIEN and YUTIQ, may not achieve commercialization at levels of market acceptance that will continue to allow us to achieve profitability; 
•
Cortrophin Gel is our first rare disease pharmaceutical product. To the extent we are not able to continue to achieve commercial success with this product, including expanding the market and gaining market share, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be negatively impacted;
•
We may fail to realize the benefits expected from our acquisition of Alimera and the combined company may not perform as we or the market expects;
•
The limited number of suppliers for our API could result in lengthy delays in production if we need to change suppliers;
•
Several of the products we have acquired cannot be manufactured in our facilities and we must secure and maintain qualified and compliant contract manufacturers. Noncompliance by these contract manufacturers or our inability to find qualified contract manufacturers could result in us being unable to commercialize these products; Several of our products are manufactured and/or packaged by single-sourced third parties, which we cannot control and could result in us being unable to market and distribute products;
•
We are subject to United States federal and state laws related to healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security, and the failure to comply with such laws may adversely affect our business;
•
Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could subject us to government enforcement actions, private litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our operating results and business;
•
Our Medicaid rebate accruals have increased and continue to increase due to our acquisitions and subsequent sales of branded products and authorized generics of branded products;
•
Our accruals for the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program have increased due to growth and acquisitions;
•
We expect to spend a significant amount of resources on research and development efforts, and such efforts may not result in marketable products;
•
Production at any or all of our three current manufacturing facilities could be interrupted, which could cause us to fail to deliver product on a timely basis;
•
We rely on third parties to assist with our clinical trials. If these parties do not perform or are non-compliant, it could negatively impact the clinical trial and potential of regulatory approval; further, we may be required to audit or redo previously completed trials or recall already-approved commercial products;
•
Clinical trials for our products may not generate the outcomes we expect, may take longer or be more costly to complete than we anticipate;
•
We may be adversely affected by the expiration of patents that protect key aspects of our products in the near- to medium-term;
•
Inability to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries could negatively affect sales of our branded products;

•
If we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license development or commercialization rights to products or technology from third parties, we could lose license rights that are material to our business;
•
Our success is largely dependent upon certain key employees, including members of our senior management, the loss of whom could adversely affect our operations;
•
We rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption, or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to operate the business effectively;
•
We are involved in and may become involved in legal proceedings from time to time, which may result in substantial losses, government enforcement actions, damage to our business and reputation, and place a strain on our internal resources;
•
We are susceptible to product liability claims that may not be covered by insurance, which, if successful, could require us to pay substantial sums;
•
The obligations and liabilities of Alimera, some of which may be unanticipated or unknown, may be greater than we have anticipated, which may diminish the value of Alimera to us;
•
Our operations in an international market subject us to additional regulatory oversight both in the international market and in the U.S., as well as, social, and political uncertainties, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results; 
•
Our operations, including those resulting from our acquisition of Alimera, and its international operations, will subject us to political and economic risks, increase our exposure to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, tax, and other laws and regulations;
•
Future acquisitions and investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial position and operating results;
•
Pharmaceutical product quality standards are steadily increasing on all products, and if we cannot meet these standards, we may be required to discontinue marketing and/or recall products from the market;
•
Federal and state false claims litigation brought against us by private individuals and the government could result in civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and other related actions;
•
The use of legal, regulatory, and legislative strategies by competitors could result in increased costs to develop and market our products, delay new product introductions and reduce profit potential;
•
Third-party payer actions may prevent us from effectively marketing our products or cause us to decrease pricing;
•
Healthcare reform legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results;
•
Public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics (such as COVID-19) have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business;
•
The continuing trend toward consolidation of customer groups could result in declines in the sales volume and prices of our products, and increased fees charged by customers; 
•
The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) does not provide guidance on safety labeling for products that are marketed without approved New Drug Applications (“NDAs”) or Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”), which could increase our potential liability with respect to failure-to-warn claims for these products;
•
Four of our products are marketed without approved NDAs or ANDAs and we can offer no assurances that the FDA will not require us to either seek approval for these products or withdraw them from the market. In either case, our business, financial position, and operating results could be materially adversely affected;
•
If the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) does not approve supply of the API we need to manufacture our controlled substances, we may be unable to manufacture controlled substances, which would eliminate our revenue on these products; 
•
Our policies regarding returns, allowances and chargebacks, and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers may reduce revenues in future fiscal periods;
•
Our indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation; 
•
To service our indebtedness, we will be required to generate a significant amount of cash; 
•
Our New Credit Agreement contain restrictive and financial covenants and if are not in compliance with these covenants, our outstanding indebtedness under this facility could be accelerated and the lenders could terminate their commitments under the facility;
•
Certain risks relating to our 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 and related capped call transactions; and
•
Raising additional funds by issuing additional equity securities may cause dilution to our current stockholders. Raising additional funds by entering into additional credit or other borrowing facilities or issuing debt may subject us to covenants and other requirements that may restrict our operations.
