Item 2. Properties
Our corporate headquarters and operations are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
In November 2019, we entered into a lease of laboratory and office space at 301 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts to be used as our new corporate headquarters. The expiration date was originally in August 2025 and included an option to extend the term by two years. In May 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the Lease to extend the term for approximately two years, commencing on August 19, 2025 with an option to extend the term by five years.
​
We believe that our existing facility is adequate to meet our current needs, and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed.
