SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), including the documents incorporated by reference, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are including this statement for purposes of complying with those safe harbor provisions. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential”, “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:
●
the success, cost and timing of clinical trials for apitegromab (such as our Phase 2 EMBRAZE clinical trial) and SRK-181, including the progress, completion, timing of results, and actual results of our clinical trials;
●
the timing, scope, or likelihood of our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the European Commission (“EC”) and other regulatory authorities for apitegromab, and any related restrictions, limitations or warnings in the label of any approval for apitegromab;
●
our success in identifying and executing a development program for our preclinical product candidates, including SRK-439, SRK-373, SRK-256 and identifying additional product candidates from our preclinical programs and research pipeline;
●
our success in identifying and executing development programs for additional indications for apitegromab and SRK-181;
●
the clinical utility of our product candidates and their potential advantages over other therapeutic options;
●
the fact that topline or interim data from our clinical studies may not be predictive of the final or more detailed results of such study or the results of other ongoing or future studies;
●
the potential benefit of orphan drug exclusivity, Orphan Drug Designation, Fast Track Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for apitegromab, SRK-181 and any other of our product candidates that may receive one or more of these designations;
●
our ability to obtain, generally or on terms acceptable to us, funding for our operations, including funding necessary to complete further development and, upon successful development, if approved, commercialization of apitegromab, SRK-181, SRK-439, SRK-373, SRK-256 or any of our future product candidates;
●
our ability to retain our executives and highly skilled technical and managerial personnel, which could be affected due to any transition in management, or if we fail to recruit additional highly skilled personnel;
●
our expectations regarding our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates and the duration of such protection and our ability to operate our business without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others;
●
our ability, through third party manufacturers, to successfully manufacture our product candidates for clinical trials and for commercial use, if approved;
●
our ability to successfully build a commercial infrastructure to launch and market apitegromab, or otherwise provide access to apitegromab, if and when it is approved or receives pricing or reimbursement approval;
●
the rate and degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved;

●
our ability to establish or maintain collaborations or strategic relationships; 
●
our expectations relating to the potential of our proprietary platform technology;
●
the size and growth potential of the markets for our product candidates, and our ability to serve those markets, either alone or in combination with others;
●
the impact of new laws and regulations or amendments to existing laws and regulations in the United States and foreign countries;
●
risks associated with the impact of global economic and political developments on our business, including rising inflation and capital market disruptions, economic sanctions and economic slowdowns or recessions or public health pandemics;
●
developments and projections relating to our competitors and our industry;
●
our estimates and expectations regarding cash, cash reserves, and expense levels, future revenues, capital requirements and needs for additional financing, including our expected use of proceeds from our public offerings, and liquidity sources; 
●
our expectations regarding the period during which we qualify as a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act; and
●
other risks and uncertainties, including those listed under the caption Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors”.
The risks set forth above are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and Current Reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Current Reports on Form 8-K or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update any forward-looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or otherwise, and you should not rely upon these forward-looking statements after the date of this report.
We may from time to time provide estimates, projections and other information concerning our industry, the general business environment, and the markets for certain diseases, including estimates regarding the potential size of those markets and the estimated incidence and prevalence of certain medical conditions. Information that is based on estimates, forecasts, projections, market research or similar methodologies is inherently subject to uncertainties, and actual events, circumstances or numbers, including actual disease prevalence rates and market size, may differ materially from the information reflected in this Annual Report. Unless otherwise expressly stated, we obtained this industry data, business information, market data, prevalence information and other data from reports, research surveys, studies and similar data prepared by market research firms and other third parties, industry, medical and general publications, government data, and similar sources, in some cases applying our own assumptions and analysis that may, in the future, prove not to have been accurate.
